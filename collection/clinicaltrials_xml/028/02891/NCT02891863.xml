      The LEVER study is a prospective, unblinded, non-randomized, first in human feasibility
      study that will assess and characterize early safety and effectiveness of low energy
      therapies in converting monomorphic ventricular tachycardias (MVTs). Subjects must be
      already indicated for standard of care VT procedure during which VT is likely to be induced
      (such as VT testing, VT ablation, VT mapping, or VT risk stratification testing.)

      The study patches will be applied to the subject's torso, and the patches will be connected
      to the LEVER Acute Study System. Pacing capture threshold capture may be assessed. If
      monomorphic VT is induced and reaches at least 170bpm (350ms/cycle), one or more of the low
      energy therapies will be applied under oversight of the investigator, in an attempt to treat
      and convert the VT.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of ventricular tachycardia indicated for ventricular testing
             procedures that may include VT induction, such as VT testing, VT ablation, VT
             mapping, or VT risk stratification testing.

          -  Subjects age 18 or above, or of legal age to give written informed consent specific
             to local laws and requirements

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are suitable to be enrolled in a
             clinical study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any comorbidities that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             exclude them from standard of care VT testing

          -  Subjects with VT that is known to be focal in nature

          -  Subjects whom the investigator believes are not hemodynamically stable enough to
             tolerate testing

          -  Subjects of childbearing age who may be pregnant.

          -  Subjects who are unwilling or unable to provide written informed consent.

          -  Subjects with any implanted device that emits electrical energy where either therapy
             cannot be temporarily disabled, or the subject cannot tolerate temporary disabling of
             therapy.
