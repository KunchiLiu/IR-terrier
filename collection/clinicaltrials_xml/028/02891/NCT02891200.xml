    <textblock>
      The study is to compare the effectiveness of two health communication and dissemination
      strategies that are designed to engage patients and family caregivers in successfully
      managing COPD in 'real-world' settings. Both strategies aim to advance patient understanding
      of COPD, its treatment options, and self-care tasks; support them in coping with the
      disease; and enable them to adopt a variety of positive behaviors, including adherence to
      treatment plans, smoking cessation, joining pulmonary rehabilitation programs, and assuming
      an active, healthy lifestyle. One strategy relies on the healthcare professional (HCP) as
      the primary communicator about COPD self-management (HCP arm), whereas the other uses a dual
      approach that involves both healthcare professionals and peer mentors delivering such
      communication (HCP plus Peer arm). Peer mentors are COPD patients and caregivers who have
      successfully managed COPD and have received foundational training on peer mentoring.
      Specifically, the study aims are to : 1) Conduct a randomized controlled trial in which the
      'HCP' and 'HCP plus Peer' strategies are tested in 'real-world' healthcare settings; 2)
      compare the impact of these strategies on patient satisfaction, experience, activation,
      self- efficacy, self-care behavior, health status, quality of life, use of Emergency
      Department (ED) and hospital services, and survival; and, 3) compare the impact of these
      strategies on caregiver satisfaction, experience, self-efficacy, stress, and coping skills.

      The study is not currently recruiting study participants as it is in the intervention
      development phase ( phase 1 of the study). Recruitment of study participants will start in
      January 2017.

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a prevalent global condition that results in
      high mortality, morbidity, symptom burden, and functional limitations that impact the
      quality of life. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the US and a leading cause of
      hospitalizations. COPD patients report unmet needs in regards to information about their
      disease and how to manage and cope with it at an intellectual, emotional, and social level.
      Many COPD patients lack the information and skills that they need to correctly use their
      inhaled medications, manage 'breathlessness episodes', and detect early signs of a COPD
      exacerbation. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are established to help COPD patients
      increase their exercise capacity and reduce fatigue and dyspnea with daily activity. While
      clinical trials testing these programs have demonstrated significant improvements in
      health-related quality of life and reduced dyspnea and fatigue amongst participants, it
      remains unclear how best to engage and motivate patients to participate in them.

      Self-management support interventions which involve &quot;collaboratively helping patients
      acquire and practice the skills needed to carry out disease-specific medical regimens,
      change their health behavior to adjust their roles for optimal function, improve day-to-day
      control of their disease, and improve their well-being&quot;, have been demonstrated in several
      trials to improve health-related quality of life, and reduce symptom burden,
      hospitalizations, and ED visits amongst COPD patients. However, it is still unclear which
      self-management support strategies employed in 'real world' settings are most effective in
      engaging, motivating, and enabling patients to successfully follow recommended treatments,
      adopt desired health behaviors, and thus achieve the desired improvements in their health
      outcomes.

      The planned study design is a single- blinded randomized controlled trial to compare the
      effectiveness of two strategies for engaging and supporting COPD patients and their family
      caregivers in self-management of COPD. The two strategies/study arms are: 1) the 'HCP arm'
      where the healthcare professional (HCP) is the primary communicator about COPD
      self-management with the patient participants; and 2) the 'HCP plus Peer arm', where both
      healthcare professionals and peer mentors engage with study participants in conversations
      about COPD self-management using multiple channels including 1:1 and group conversations.
      One hundred and thirty-nine participants will be randomized into the 'HCP arm', and 186
      patients into the 'HCP plus Peer arm'.

      The trial will be conducted amongst COPD patients coming to the hospital or clinic at two
      study sites within Johns Hopkins Healthcare System. Recruitment from both sites and multiple
      settings allows for a more representative COPD patient population to be enrolled in the
      study, thus increasing the external validity of study findings.

      The research study will answer the research question: Amongst COPD patients and their
      caregivers, would a dual strategy that combines healthcare professional and peer mentor
      delivery of COPD self- management education and support result in greater improvements in
      health status and quality of life, and reductions in acute healthcare services' utilization,
      compared to relying on healthcare professionals alone in these communications? Would such
      dual strategy result in reduced caregiver stress and improved coping and satisfaction? The
      study hypothesis is that the dual strategy of using 'HCP plus peer support' to engage and
      support COPD patients and caregivers will have superior outcomes to the 'HCP only' strategy
      in the following areas : a) Improved health- related quality of life and reduced numbers of
      COPD-related hospital and ED visits; b) improved patient activation, self-efficacy, and
      self-care behaviors; c) improved family caregivers' satisfaction and self- efficacy. These
      improvements will be noted at 3, 6, and 9 months compared to baseline.
