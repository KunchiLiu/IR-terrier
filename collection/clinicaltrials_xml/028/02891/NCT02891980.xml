  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity
      of two heterologous and two homologous prime-boost regimens using MVA-BN®-Filo and
      Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different sequences at Days 1 and 29 in healthy adult subjects
      aged 18 - 45 years.The study will evaluate the 'omics (transcriptomics, proteomics,
      lipidomics, metabolomics), antibodies for immunogenicity, CMI, ADCC, lymphoproliferative and
      plasmablast responses to MVA-BN®-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines. The primary objectives of
      this study are: 1) To Assess the safety and reactogenicity of each study group. 2) To assess
      responses to the study vaccination by study group after the first, second and third dose by
      transcriptomics. 3) To assess the peak antibody response to the study vaccination by study
      group to filovirus antigens.

      of two heterologous and two homologous prime-boost regimens using MVA-BN®-Filo and
      Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different sequences at Days 1 and 29 in healthy adult subjects
      aged 18 - 45 years. The two heterologous prime-boost groups will also receive MVA-BN®-Filo
      at day 366. Sixty subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of four study groups (15 per
      group).Subjects and study staff will be blinded to a subject's study vaccine assignment
      within study vaccination schedule (e.g., enrollment into Group 1 or 4 versus 2 or 3 will be
      known). The study will evaluate the 'omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics,
      metabolomics), antibodies for immunogenicity, CMI, ADCC, lymphoproliferative and plasmablast
      responses to MVA-BN®-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines. The primary objectives of this study are:
      1) To Assess the safety and reactogenicity of each study group. 2) To assess responses to
      the study vaccination by study group after the first, second and third dose by
      transcriptomics. 3) To assess the peak antibody response to the study vaccination by study
      group to filovirus antigens. Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess antigen-specific
      cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses to the study vaccination by study group.2) To Assess
      antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses to the study vaccination by
      study group.

        eligibility - Received a licensed live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment in this
        study, or plans to receive a licensed live vaccine within 30 days before or after each
        study vaccine. - Received a licensed inactivated vaccine within 14 days prior to
        enrollment in this study, or plans to receive a licensed inactivated vaccine within 14
        days before or after each study vaccine. - Use of experimental therapeutic agents within 3
        months from the start of screening. - Current or planned participation in another clinical
        study during the study period. - Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulin in the past 3

        blood during participation in the study (from the start of screening onwards). - Major
        psychiatric illness during the past 12 months that in the opinion of the investigator
        would preclude participation. - Current or past abuse of recreational or narcotic drugs. -
        Current or past alcohol use judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with
        subject study adherence. - History of chronic urticaria (recurrent hives). - Chronic or
        recurrent use of medications which modify host immune response (e.g., cancer
        chemotherapeutic agents, parenteral corticosteroids). - Subject who cannot communicate
        reliably with the investigator. - Subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, is
        unlikely to adhere to the requirements of the study. - Any condition that, in the opinion
        of the investigator, might interfere with assessing the study objectives. - Personnel
        involved in the study.
