  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a serious chronic disease with frequent readmissions, some of which
      can be prevented by early action. The management of HF is complex: long, often difficult and
      costly. In France, nearly one million people suffer from HF and 120,000 new cases are
      diagnosed every year. With the aging population, this number will continue to evolve and
      become a real public health problem. Within 10 to 20 years ahead, WHO projects that heart
      failure in either the 3 most common diseases in industrialized countries.

      Investigators goals are to make an inventory of PRADO-IC project in terms of its
      effectiveness on readmission of patients with heart failure.
