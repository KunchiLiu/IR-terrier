      The aim of this phase 1 study is to determine the role of autologous adipose derived
      mesenchymal stem cells in the reduction of hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula failure when
      applied during the time of surgical creation.

          -  Patient between 18 and 85 years old

          -  Patient currently on hemodialysis and planned creation of an upper extremity AV
             fistula with suitable anatomy

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL and platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 prior to surgery (Day 0)

          -  Other hematological and biochemical parameters within a range consistent with ESRD

          -  Adequate liver function, defined as serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; GGT, AST, ALT, and
             alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2x upper limit of normal or INR ≤ 1.5 prior to day 1 or INR ≤
             2 (2.5 certain conditions) if on anticoagulant therapy.

             written informed consent, and ability to comply with entire study procedures

          -  Life expectancy of at least 24 months

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History or evidence of severe cardiac disease (NYHA Functional Class III or IV),
             myocardial infarction within 6 months of entry, ventricular tachyarrhythmias
             requiring continuing treatment, or unstable angina

          -  Significant uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure above 160 mm Hg and/or
             diastolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg)

          -  History or evidence of severe peripheral vascular disease in the upper limbs or known
             or suspected central vein obstruction on the side of planned fistula creation

          -  Stroke within six (6) months of study entry

          -  Treatment with vitamin K-antagonists or direct thrombin inhibitors with an INR ≥ 2

          -  Malignancy or treatment for malignancy within the previous 6 months

          -  Immunodeficiency including AIDS / HIV or Active autoimmune disease

          -  Documented hypercoagulable state or history of 2 or more DVTs or other spontaneous
             intravascular thrombotic events

          -  Bleeding diathesis or Gastrointestinal ulcer or bleeding, or wound dehiscence

          -  A prothrombin time or a partial thromboplastin time more than 1.2 times the upper
             limit of normal, or absolute platelet counts below the lower limit of normal; an
             absolute neutrophil count below 1,500/mm3

          -  Active local or systemic infection (WBC &gt; 15,000/mm3) or anemia with a hematocrit
             less than 30%

          -  Previous autogenous fistula in the operative limb unless the AVF can be placed more
             proximally than previous failed fistula or more than 1 failed AVF in the operative
             limb

          -  Known serious allergy to aspirin or penicillin

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug/ device within 60 days prior to study entry
             or Any other condition which in the judgment of the investigator would preclude
             adequate evaluation of the safety and efficacy of AMSCs and the AVF
