  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of lymphoma in adult participants with
      moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis who are treated with Simponi versus those treated with
      thiopurines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective long-term exposure registry of adult participants with
      moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Two cohorts, a Simponi-exposed cohort and a
      comparator cohort treated with thiopurines, will be enrolled in study. Approximately 6,000
      participants are planned for enrollment, with 3,000 participants in the Simponi-exposed
      cohort and 3,000 participants in the comparator cohort. Participants will receive treatments
      in a routine clinical setting as prescribed by their physician. After enrollment, during the
      10-year follow-up period, a participant may stop his or her ulcerative colitis treatment
      regimen and switch to a new treatment regimen. Lymphoma incidence will be primarily assessed
      by a questionnaire that will be sent to the investigator to obtain complete medical
      information about each case. An expert panel of medical specialists with extensive
      experience in lymphoma will be convened to validate cases of lymphoma. Besides assessing the
      incidence of lymphoma, long-term safety will be evaluated by capturing other adverse events
      of interest and serious adverse events.

    <measure>Clinical Disease Status as assessed by Partial Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The partial Mayo score, a validated tool used to assess disease status in participants with ulcerative colitis, will be utilized to assess clinical status in this registry. Information will be obtained using 3 of the individual components of the full Mayo score, including stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and PGA (Physician's Global Assessment). Each component score ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease) and the score is the sum of those three categories. The total Partial Mayo Score will be calculated as the sum of the scores of all 3 components for each participant that ranges from 0-9.</description>

    <description>The SIBDQ is a disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire, able to detect and define meaningful clinical changes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients by measuring physical, social and emotional status. The total score ranges from 10 (worst health) to 70 (best health).</description>
