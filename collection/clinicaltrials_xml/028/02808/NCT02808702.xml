      The purpose of this study is to determine whether neuroimaging-based markers of maladaptive
      self-focused processing are better predictors of treatment response to cognitive-behavioral
      therapy than behavioral markers.

      First, the investigators propose to identify the neural correlates of self-focused
      processing. The investigators will assess baseline resting state connectivity within the
      default network, as well as regional brain activation using a well-validated event-related
      fMRI task that manipulates self-focused processing in patients with body dysmorphic and
      socially anxious symptoms, compared to healthy controls. This clinical sample was selected
      because such patients display heightened self-focused attention, and sampling individuals
      across these symptom dimensions will ensure greater variability on this dimension of
      maladaptive self-focused processing. Second, the investigators will examine the neural
      correlates of self-focused processing as a predictor of treatment response. Neuroimaging
      data will be acquired from patients with body dysmorphic and socially anxious symptoms
      during two scan sessions, before and after 12 weeks of individual cognitive behavioral
      therapy, and compared with healthy controls scanned twice at a 12 week interval. Finally,
      the investigators will compare the prediction of treatment response between neural measures
      and behavioral measures of self-focused processing. The investigators will assess the
      behavioral correlates of self-focused processing using a self-reference effect paradigm, and
      assess their relation to treatment response. If the investigators hypotheses are borne out,
      the investigators will have new targets for treatment, a method to identify promising
      candidates for treatment, and sensitive surrogate markers of treatment response.
