    <textblock>
      This multi-center, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized crossover design study will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied naloxone lotion, 0.5%, for the
      treatment of pruritus in patients with the mycosis fungoides (MF) form of Cutaneous T-cell
      Lymphoma (CTCL). This study will also determine if there is systemic absorption of the drug
      in a subset of subjects and if so, describe the range and mean plasma levels reached after
      two weeks of three time daily (TID) dosing.

      There will be 160 subjects enrolled in the study. The study consists of a Screening Period
      of up to 7 days during which inclusion / exclusion criteria will be reviewed. Subjects
      meeting inclusion / exclusion criteria including the diagnostic criteria for MF and a score
      of at least 5 on the 11-Point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pruritus will complete the one
      week Screening Period. Subjects will complete a daily diary for NRS for Pruritus scores. At
      the end of the Screening Period, subjects who have a NRS for Pruritus score of at least 5
      recorded in the diary on at least 4 of the 7 days preceding Day 0 will be eligible to
      continue. Baseline assessments will be recorded for vital signs, pruritic body surface area,
      skin integrity, and laboratory results. The Baseline period will be followed by a 2 week
      Treatment Period 1 in which subjects will be randomized to Naloxone Lotion 0.5% or Placebo
      Lotion to be applied TID for 14 days. During the 2 week Treatment Period subjects will
      complete daily diaries of NRS for Pruritis scores and Sleep scores. On Day 14 subjects will
      return to the clinic to review diaries, adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and
      to record body surface area for pruritus, skin integrity, and laboratory results. Subjects
      will then enter a Washout Period for up to 28 days until the subject again scores at least 5
      on the NRS for Pruritus on 4 consecutive or 4 of the past 7 days. Subjects who remain
      eligible will enter a 2 week Treatment Period 2 during which the same procedures as
      Treatment Period 1 will be performed except subjects will receive the alternate treatment to
      that assigned in Treatment Period 1.

    <description>The difference in the proportion of subjects with a meaningful clinically significant improvement at the end of the two periods. A clinically significant improvement is defined as an improvement of at least one category on the 4-point (none, mild, moderate, severe) Likert Scale verbal rating scale (VRS) and at least two points on the 11-point NRS for Pruritus. The NRS for Pruritus scores will be converted to VRS scores as follows for the analysis: 0=none, 1-3=mild, 4-6=moderate, and 7-10=severe.</description>

             clinical, and immunophenotypical criteria. The histological criteria will be based on
             skin biopsy from the most representative skin area. The diagnostic criteria used for
             each subject will be specified in the case report forms.

             The skin (T), lymph nodes (N), visceral involvement (M), and blood (B) (TNMB) system
             will be used to classify the stage of disease.
