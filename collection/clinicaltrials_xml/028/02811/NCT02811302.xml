  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRODIGY is a prospective, multi-center, post-market, international cohort study. The primary
      objective of this study is to derive a score to identify subjects at risk to have
      respiratory depression (RD) episodes in patients undergoing opioid therapy in the hospital
      ward and monitored by capnography. The score will be derived by using subjects within the
      derivation cohort and internally validated using subjects within the validation cohort.

      The primary endpoint used to derive the score will be the occurrence of RD episodes derived
      by Capnostream 20p device memory data combined with clinical data and validated by an
      independent Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC) during the study course.

Continuous respiratory monitoring using a Capnostream monitor will be included for collecting data for end tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) and Oxygen saturation (SpO2)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients receiving parenteral opioid therapy (for post-surgical or non-surgical) pain
             on the hospital ward.

          2. Adult age (≥18 year old in US and Europe; ≥20 years old in Japan; ≥21 years old in
             Singapore).

          3. Patient is able and willing to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Expected length of stay ≤ 24 hours.

          2. Patient is receiving intrathecal opioids.

          3. Post-surgical patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status
             (ASA PS) V or higher.

          4. Patients with the status of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR), hospice, or receiving end of
             life therapy.

          5. Ventilated or intubated patients.

          6. Patient is unwilling or unable to comply fully with study procedures (including
             non-toleration of the capnography cannula) due to any disease condition which can
             raise doubt about compliance and influencing the study outcome.

          7. Patient is a member of a vulnerable population, including legal incapacity or
             evidence that a subject cannot understand the purpose and risks of the study,
             regardless of authorized representative support.

          8. Patient is participating in another potentially confounding drug or device clinical
             study.
