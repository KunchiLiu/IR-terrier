    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a
             clear-cell component

          -  At least 1 measurable target lesion according to Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) 1.1

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥70

          -  Adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without antihypertensive
             medications, defined as BP ≤150/90 mmHg at Screening and no change in
             antihypertensive medications within 1 week prior to Cycle 1/Day 1 (C1/D1)

          -  Adequate organ function per blood work

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have received any systemic anticancer therapy for RCC, including
             anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, or any systemic
             investigational anticancer agent

          -  Subjects with central nervous system (CNS) metastases are not eligible, unless they
             have completed local therapy (eg, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), surgery or
             radiosurgery) and have discontinued the use of corticosteroids for this indication
             for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment in this study. Any signs (eg,
             radiologic) or symptoms of brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks
             before starting study treatment

          -  Active malignancy (except for RCC, definitively treated basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, and carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or bladder) within the
             past 24 months. Subjects with history of localized &amp; low risk prostate cancer are
             allowed in the study if they were treated with curative intent and there is no
             prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence within the past 5 years

          -  Prior radiation therapy within 21 days prior to start of study treatment with the
             exception of palliative radiotherapy to bone lesions, which is allowed if completed 2
             weeks prior to study treatment start

          -  Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study treatment

          -  Subjects with urine protein ≥1 gram/24 hour

          -  Fasting total cholesterol &gt;300 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) (or ˃7.75 millimole
             per liter (mmol/L)) and/or fasting triglycerides level ˃2.5 x upper limit of normal
             (ULN). Note: these subjects can be included after initiation or adjustment of
             lipid-lowering medication

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting glucose &gt;1.5 times the ULN. Note: these
             subjects can be included after initiation or adjustment of glucose-lowering
             medication

          -  Prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) interval to &gt;480 milliseconds (ms)

          -  Bleeding or thrombotic disorders or subjects at risk for severe hemorrhage. The
             degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery)
             should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated
             with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy

          -  Clinically significant hemoptysis or tumor bleeding within 2 weeks prior to the first
             dose of study drug

          -  Significant cardiovascular impairment within 6 months of the first dose of study
             drug: history of congestive heart failure greater than New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) Class II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction or stroke, cardiac arrhythmia
             associated with significant cardiovascular impairment, or a left ventricular ejection
             fraction (LVEF) below the institutional normal range as determined by multiple gated
             acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram

          -  Active infection (any infection requiring systemic treatment)

          -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive

          -  Known active Hepatitis B (eg, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) reactive) or
             Hepatitis C (eg, hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) [qualitative] is
             detected)

          -  Known history of, or any evidence of, interstitial lung disease

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or current
             pneumonitis

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or who are receiving systemic steroid
             therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the
             first dose of study treatment. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (up to
             7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) may be approved after consultation with the
             sponsor

          -  Active autoimmune disease (with the exception of psoriasis) that has required
             systemic treatment in the past 2 years (ie, with use of disease modifying agents,
             corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment
