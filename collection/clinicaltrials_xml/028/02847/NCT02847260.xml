    <measure>Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the rapid dose titration regimen of subcutaneous (SQ) Remodulin by successful completion of the 16 week treatment period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 16</time_frame>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Six minute Walk Distance at Week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the six minute walk test (6MWT) is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out activities of daily living. Patients will be instructed to walk down a corridor at a comfortable speed as far as they could manage for six minutes, resting whenever they needed. Distance &lt;500 meters suggests considerable exercise limitation; Distance 500 - 800 meters suggests moderate limitation; Distance &gt;800 meters (with no rests) suggests mild or no limitation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Borg Dyspnea Score (Following 6MWT) From Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg dyspnea score is a 10 point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea (difficulty in breathing) experienced during the (6MWT). The Borg dyspnea score will be assessed immediately following the 6MWT. Scores range from 0 (for no shortness of breath) to 10 (for the greatest shortness of breath ever experienced).</description>

    <measure>Change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations From Baseline to Week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The level of this biomarker of the (NT-proBNP) serum concentration will be assessed to compare the severity of heart failure at Baseline and Week 16.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with a Change From Baseline World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Classification at Week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO Functional Class of pulmonary hypertension is a physical activity rating scale as follows: Class I: No limitation of physical activity. Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Class IV: Inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment: Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) From Baseline to Week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The CAMPHOR is a health related quality of life instrument validated for pulmonary hypertension that assesses impairment (symptoms), disability (activities) and quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into three sections; Symptoms (Scores 025; high scores indicate more symptoms), Activity (Score 030; low score indicates good functioning) and Quality of Life (025; high scores indicate poor QoL). The sum of these scores equates to the Total score (080). In the CAMPHOR scores, lower scores indicate improvements.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary hypertension defined as an increase in pressure in the pulmonary vasculature defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) greater than 25 mmHg at rest or greater than 30 mmHg with exercise, as measured by Swan-Ganz right heart catheterization. The PAPm, RAPm and PCWPm values and their respective changes from Baseline to Week 16 will be measured by SwanGanz right heart catheterization and summarized.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in Hemodynamic Parameters: Cardiac Index (CI) (L/Min/m^2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac Index (CI) relates the cardiac output (CO) to body surface area (BSA), thus relating heart performance to the size of the individual. The CI values and their respective changes from Baseline to Week 16 will be measured by SwanGanz right heart catheterization and summarized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in HemodynamicParameters: Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Index (PVRI) (mmHg*Min*m^2/L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Index (PVRI) is calculated using Mean Pulmonary Arterial Pressure(PAPm), Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP) and Cardiac Index (CI ), to provide information about right ventricular load. The PVRI values and their respective changes from Baseline to Week 16 will be measured by SwanGanz right heart catheterization.</description>

    <description>Remodulin will be initiated, whilst subjects are hospitalized (minimum of 72 hours) and under medical supervision, at approximately 2 ng/kg/min as a continuous SC infusion with dose increments of 1-2 ng/kg/min applied approximately every 12 hours according to clinical response and tolerability. Following discharge, dose rate increments are permitted at 1-2 ng/kg/min with a minimum of 24 hours between each dose up-titration. Once a dose rate of 20 ng/kg/min is achieved, the dose increments can be increased up to 4 ng/kg/min with dose increments separated by at least 24 hours. The aim is to achieve a target dose of 10, 20, and 30 ng/kg/min by the end of weeks 1, 4 and 12, respectively.</description>

    <description>Treatment will be initiated whilst hospitalized at approximately 2.0 ng/kg/min with dose increments of 1- 2 ng/kg/min approximately every 12 hours according to clinical response and tolerability. Following subject discharge, the dose rate is increased by 1-2 ng/kg/min with dose increments separated by at least 24 hours. When a dose rate of 20 ng/kg/min is achieved dose increments can be increased at a rate of up to 4 ng/kg/min with dose increments separated by at least 24 hours depending on tolerability. The aim is to achieve a dose rate of at least 10, 20 and 30 ng/kg/min by the end of weeks 1, 4 and 12, respectively and a dose rate by the end of week 16 that achieves pre-defined treatment goals subject to clinical response and tolerability.</description>
