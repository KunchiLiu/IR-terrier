      This is an observational, multicenter study in patients treated with nivolumab for the
      approved indications of melanoma and lung cancer in Australia, the EU, Switzerland, and the
      United States (US). Targeted countries in the EU for study participation include Austria,
      Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK). Study objectives are to
      assess the safety experience, survival, adverse event management, and outcomes of adverse
      events associated with nivolumab in routine oncology care facilities.

        The study population consists of 400 adults treated with nivolumab for histologically or
        cytologically confirmed melanoma and 800 adults treated with nivolumab for histologically
        or cytologically confirmed lung cancer in accordance with the approved indications in
        Australia, the EU, Switzerland, and the US. Target EU countries for patient enrollment
        include Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Patients who begin
        treatment with nivolumab for the first time will be enrolled in accordance with the
        approved indications and whose treatment strategy was determined independently from
        consideration of study participation. Treatment will be determined at the treating
        physician's discretion and with the patient's consent.
