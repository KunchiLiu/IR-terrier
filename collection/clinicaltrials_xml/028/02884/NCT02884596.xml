  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the success of inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB)
      for mandibular molars with irreversible pulpitis in women under treatment with selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in one mandibular
      molar were assigned to either SSRI users or SSRI non-users groups. SSRIs users were 35 women
      who take SSRIs referred for endodontic treatment from a psychiatric clinic to the clinic of
      the endodontic department of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. SSRIs non-users were
      also 35 women who did not take SSRIs referred for endodontic treatment to the same dental
      clinic. The protocol of the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the university
      (no. 394867). Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. The level of
      anxiety of the patients was determined by using the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale. The patients
      registered their baseline pain severity using a Heft-Parker visual analogue scale (HP-VAS).
      Two standard IANBs (1.8-mL cartridges) of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine
      (Darupakhsh, Tehran, Iran) were administered to each patient. Fifteen minutes after
      injection, the teeth were isolated with a rubber dam, and access cavity preparation was
      initiated. The same operator instructed the patients to rate any pain experienced during the
      preparation of access cavity or the placement of initial file. If the patient felt pain, the
      treatment was immediately suspended, and the patient recorded the pain intensity by using
      the HP-VAS. No or mild pain (HP-VAS score â‰¤ 54) was defined as success.

        Seventy adult women patients participated in this study and were assigned to either SSRIs
        users or SSRIs non-users groups. SSRIs users were 35 women who take SSRIs referred for
        endodontic treatment from a psychiatric clinic to the clinic of the endodontic department
        of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. SSRIs non-users were also 35 women who did not
        take SSRIs referred for endodontic treatment to the same dental clinic.
