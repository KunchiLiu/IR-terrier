      This case-control study compares IVF results and live birth rates in women undergoing IVF
      with a history of bariatric surgery as compared to women without bariatric surgery history
      and matched for weight, age and parity.

      A preliminary study in the participating center showed a tend to lower ovarian response to
      stimulation and live birth rates after bariatric surgery compared to weight-matched
      patients. However, statistical significance was not reached, as the sample size was small.

      The aim of the research project is to study the ovarian response and live birth rates of
      this bariatric surgery population, with a sufficient number of patients, in order to reach
      higher statistical power. This case-control study will involve 2 IVF (in-vitro
      fertilization) centers in France (Rouen and Bondy). All patients undergoing IVF with a
      history of bariatric surgery will be included from January 2012. Each case will be matched
      for weight, age, and parity to the 2 next patients without bariatric surgery history and
      undergoing IVF. Surgery procedures include sleeve gastrectomies and by-passes. The IVF
      results ( and live birth rates will be compared between the two groups.
