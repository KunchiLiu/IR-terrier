    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of LCZ696 compared to valsartan on
      cognitive function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
      Cognitive function will be assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests with an
      evaluation of longitudinal change of cognitive domains including memory, executive function,
      and attention.

    <measure>Change from baseline in the CogState Global Cognitive Composite Score (GCCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 156</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cognition is assessed as a change in a Global Cognitive Composite Z score. The cognitive composite comprises cognitive domains including attention, memory, and executive function. A negative change from baseline will indicate worsening performance.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in a cortical composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 156</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in amyloid plaque deposition over time will be assessed using florbetapir-18F. The longitudinal change in the standardized uptake value ratio will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in individual cognitive domains (memory, executive function, and attention)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 156</time_frame>
    <description>Specific cognitive domains to be assessed include memory, executive function, and attention. A negative change from baseline will indicate worsening performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the summary score of the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 156</time_frame>
    <description>Instrumental activities of daily living will be assessed using the functional activities questionnaire. The functional activities questionnaire will be used as a standardized assessment of activities of daily living. This questionnaire is typically used to distinguish normal subjects from subjects with mild to moderate cognitive impairment. The test is made up of 10 questions that reflect a subject's ability to perform activities of daily living and to function independently. Test scores range from 0 to 30, a score of 0 is completely normal where as a higher score denotes impairment. Each of 10 questions is scored from 0, representing normal to 3, dependent on someone else to perform the activity. A negative change from baseline denotes improvement.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive LCZ696 at 100 mg twice daily for two to four weeks during a single-blind treatment run-in period that follows the comparator treatment run-in period. Down-titration is not allowed during this period. Patients who are able to tolerate LCZ696 100 mg twice daily for two weeks are eligible to enter the randomized treatment period. Patients randomized to receive LCZ696 will be given LCZ696 at 200 mg twice daily. Patients unable to tolerate the 200 mg twice daily dose may be down-titrated to 100 mg twice daily or in some cases, 50 mg twice daily. Patients will receive randomized study drug for three years.</description>

    <description>Treatment run-in period consists of valsartan 40 mg bid (if necessary), followed by valsartan 80 mg bid and then followed by LCZ696 100 mg bid, over 3 to 8 weeks. Patients will enter different parts of the treatment run-in period based on their use of RAS blockade medications at the time of enrollment. Patients may enter the treatment run-in period starting with valsartan 80 mg bid if they have been on an ACEi or ARB medication at a dose which is equivalent to or above the minimum daily dose. Patients should enter the treatment run-in period starting with valsartan 40 mg bid for 1 to 2 weeks before they start valsartan 80 mg bid if they have been on ACE or ARB at a dose less than the daily minimum dose or they are ACE or ARB naïve patients. Following the run-in period, patients randomized to receive valsartan will be given valsartan at 160 mg twice daily.</description>
