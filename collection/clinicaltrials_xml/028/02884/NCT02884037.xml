  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Non-alcoholic fatty (NAFLD) liver disease patients, the investigators hypothesized that
      rifaximin might act on Gram-negative bacteria and IBO thereby inhibiting LPS-mediated
      proinflammatory cytokine production. This work evaluates the efficacy of 6 months
      administration of rifaximin in NAFLD patients.

    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to study the effect of rifaximin on NAFLD. 126 patients with
      biopsy-proven NAFLD [42 steatosis, 84 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)] were enrolled in
      this open-label, prospective, multicentric cohort study. BMI, AST, ALT, gamma glutamyl
      transferase (γ-GGT), lipid profile, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), serum endotoxin,
      Toll-like receptor 4 (TlR4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
      and cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) levels were measured before and after a 6 month administration of
      rifaximin (1100-1200 mg/day).
