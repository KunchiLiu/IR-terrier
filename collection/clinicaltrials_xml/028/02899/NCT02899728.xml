      This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib, cediranib maleate, and standard
      chemotherapy work in treating patients with small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, cisplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. Olaparib and cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Olaparib, cediranib maleate,
      and standard chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the addition of cediranib maleate (cediranib) plus olaparib as
      maintenance therapy in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) leads to improved progression-free
      survival (PFS) compared to standard therapy (no maintenance treatment) utilizing Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of cediranib plus olaparib on overall survival (OS) in SCLC.

      II. To determine whether the addition of cediranib to cisplatin/carboplatin plus etoposide
      during induction therapy adds benefit to response rate, PFS and OS using RECIST version 1.1
      criteria.

      III. To assess safety and tolerability of the combination of cediranib plus olaparib during
      maintenance therapy.

      IV. To evaluate potential biomarkers of clinical benefit to this combination, including
      tumor proteomic and genomic markers, and circulating levels of cytokines and angiogenic
      factors, that that may be associated with clinical benefit.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) or cisplatin IV on day 1 and
      etoposide IV on days 1, 2, and 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive treatment as in Arm I and also receive cediranib maleate orally
      (PO) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients in Arm I who have stable disease, partial, or a complete response are randomized to
      receive maintenance therapy or no maintenance therapy. Patients in Arm II are assigned to
      receive maintenance therapy.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive cediranib maleate PO and olaparib PO twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-28.

      NO MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients are eligible to crossover to receive treatment with
      cediranib maleate and olaparib upon disease progression at the treating investigator's
      discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for at least
      1 year.
