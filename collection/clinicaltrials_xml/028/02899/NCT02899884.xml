      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of breakthrough cancer pain and
      characterize breakthrough cancer pain in an unselected, representative cohort of cancer
      outpatients with or without pain who attend consultations.

    <textblock>
      This study has been designed as a non-interventional, non post-authorization,
      cross-sectional, epidemiological study to determine the prevalence of breakthrough cancer
      pain and characterize breakthrough cancer pain in an unselected, representative cohort of
      cancer outpatients with or without pain.

      The study will enroll approximately 13,200 patients. This multicenter trial will be
      conducted in Spain. Data from participants will be collected through questionnaire and
      medical history in a single visit (up to 1 month).

    <measure>Pain Assessment Using the Alberta Breakthrough Pain Assessment Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (up to 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>The Alberta Breakthrough Pain Assessment Tool consists of 15 questions related to clinical domain to be completed by participant (such as relationship to baseline pain, last time pain experienced, frequency, intensity of pain at peak, location, quality, time from onset to peak intensity and end of episode, causes, predictability, general relief, relief and satisfaction from breakthrough pain medication, onset of pain relief and satisfaction) and 3 questions to be completed by physician/nurse (related to etiology, pathophysiology and medication).</description>

    <measure>Pain Assessment Using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (up to 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI questionnaire has two sections: pain intensity (4 items) and interference with activities of daily living (7 items). Each item is given a score on a numerical scale from 0 (no pain/interference with activities of daily living) to 10 (worst pain imaginable/maximum impact on activities of daily living). The results for these 11 items are then used to obtain two overall scores, one for each section: pain intensity (0-40; where 0=no pain and 40=worst pain imaginable) and interference with activities of daily living (0-70; where 0=no activities of daily living and 70= maximum impact on activities of daily living).</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 1 (up to 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was assessed on 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS); score ranges from 0 to 10 where 0=no pain and 10=worst pain.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Assessment Using the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (up to 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 health questionnaire is a 12 question assessment of functional health and well-being. The survey asks about various health aspects, including physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being). Two summary measures are derived: the Physical and the Mental Health Component Summary. For each component summary, survey items were weighted and summed to create a summary score between 0 (poor mental and physical quality of life) and 100 (better mental and physical quality of life).</description>

    <measure>Performance Status Assessment Using the Karnofsky Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (up to 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Karnofsky performance score is used to quantify participant's general well-being and activities of daily life and participants are classified based on their functional impairment. Karnofsky performance score is 11 level score which ranges between 0 (death) to 100 (participant asymptomatic with no evidence of illness). Higher score means higher ability to perform daily tasks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participantsâ‰¥ 18 years old

          -  Participants with baseline cancer pain that is adequately controlled with opioids

          -  Presence of episodes of breakthrough pain associated with the cancer pain

          -  Meeting the diagnostic criteria for breakthrough cancer pain (participant history and
             Portenoy's criteria) and the Davies algorithm

          -  Participants who are not receiving treatment for breakthrough cancer pain. It is not
             permitted the inclusion of participants receiving treatment for breakthrough cancer
             pain in order to avoid bias that may affect the characterization or taxonomy of
             breakthrough cancer pain

          -  Signing of the informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe mental illness

          -  Any medical condition or situation complicating the collection of study data as
             determined by the investigator
