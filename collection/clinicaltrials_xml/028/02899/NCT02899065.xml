  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, patient-oriented, pilot randomized clinical trial to evaluate
      (in aggregate) both the use of the Cepheid GeneXpert Flu/RSV Assay and the use of
      pharmacist-led education for providers in the interpretation of these test results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if immediate availability of the Cepheid GeneXpert Flu/RSV Assay as part of a
      stewardship intervention optimizes antiviral treatment and reduces antibiotic treatment for
      pediatric ED patients with suspected influenza v. standard care (i.e. lack of testing or
      Alere rapid molecular influenza test without patient specific treatment recommendations)
      using a prospective, patient-randomized design.

      Consented patients in the pediatric ED will be randomized into two arms: The intervention
      arm will receive the Cepheid GeneXpert Flu/RSV Assay with a patient specific stewardship
      intervention during the ED visit. The intervention will be pharmacist-led and include direct
      delivery to clinicians of information about interpreting test results and recommendations
      for antiviral-treatment for high-risk patients, and infection control precautions for
      patients being hospitalized with a positive RSV or influenza test. Clinician adherence to
      treatment guidelines with and without the educational intervention will be compared.
      Patients randomized to this arm will receive a nasopharyngeal swab collected by a nurse,
      physician or trained technician. The swab will be run in the ED by trained research staff
      for processing and evaluation. Once the results of the test are available, they will be
      printed by the research team and provided to the treating physician. Once the treating
      physician has reviewed the report, a medical record label will be placed on the report and
      the report will be placed in one of the HIM baskets in the ED for upload into the medical
      record.

      The second arm will be usual care (i.e. no test or other rapid molecular influenza test).
      Results will be delivered via standard of care through the EMR.

      Physicians and patients will not be blinded to test type. Tests will be performed on a
      real-time basis in the ED. For each of these groups, data of the frequency and duration of
      antibiotic administration, antiviral use, adherence to evidence based guidelines for
      treatment of influenza, isolation, hospitalizations, and unscheduled return visits or
      readmissions within a 30 day period will be collected and compared.

      Research coordinators will contact patients and/or parents at 1 and 4 weeks after enrollment
      for self-reported secondary outcomes including symptom resolution, return to school/work,
      and follow up healthcare visits, medication adherence (to antibiotics and/or antivirals),
      and adverse events.
