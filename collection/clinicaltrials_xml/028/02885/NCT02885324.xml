      This pilot will study the feasibility and exploratory efficacy of using Cabozantinib for
      recurrent or refractory high grade glioma for which there are no curative options. Patients
      will also be followed for safety, time to progression, event free survival and overall
      survival

    <description>Response criteria are assessed based on the product of the longest diameter and its longest perpendicular diameter.
Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Partial response (PR): ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the initial baseline measurements Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD.
Progressive Disease (PD): The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
