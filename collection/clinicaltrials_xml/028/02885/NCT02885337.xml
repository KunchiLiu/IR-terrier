  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis leads to reduced independence and quality of life. Total hip replacement is a
      successful and cost-effective surgical intervention to relieve pain and improve functioning
      in patients with osteoarthritis. Research has shown that pre-operative health status
      strongly predicts outcomes including physical function and hospitalization length after hip
      replacement surgery. Frail patients, in particular, are at greater risk of poor
      post-operative outcomes and could potentially benefit from interventions targeting an
      improvement in their health status prior to undergoing a hip replacement surgery. Partnering
      with Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) and a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare
      providers, this pilot trial will examine the feasibility of a multi-modal intervention for
      frail patients that includes a supervised exercise program, vitamin D and protein
      supplementation, and a medication review. The results of this feasibility study will guide
      the design of a future multi-center study, which if successful, could be developed into a
      routine model of care that is implemented in joint replacement programs across Ontario and
      ultimately improving the lives of frail seniors undergoing hip replacement.

      Study Design: The proposed study is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing a
      pre-operative multi-modal intervention and standard care among pre-frail/frail patients
      undergoing total hip replacement surgery. Pre-frail (score of 1 or 2) or frail (score of
      3-5; Fried Frailty Phenotype) patients, ≥ 65 years undergoing elective unilateral total hip
      replacement after at least 3 months will be recruited from the practices of 6 orthopedic
      surgeons (Hamilton Arthroplasty Group).

      A physiotherapist and research assistant (RA) will conduct the eligibility screening at the
      Regional Joint Assessment Program (Hamilton Health Sciences) during the appointment where
      the decision to operate is made (3-10 months prior to surgery). Patients with renal
      insufficiency, a neuromuscular disorder, active cancer or unstable medical conditions will
      be excluded.

      Stratified block randomization will be used to randomly allocate participants to the
      intervention or usual care arms of the study. The allocation sequence will be computer
      generated using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.3. Once the study RA confirms the
      patient's eligibility, and obtain consent, the RA will fax the participants' eligibility
      forms, consent and contact to an off-site research member who will randomize the participant
      based on the random allocation sequence generated. Then a RA will call the participants to
      inform them if they fall in the intervention or control group and arrange the first visit.

      Multi-Modal Frailty Intervention (3-10 months) Exercise: A Registered Kinesiologist will
      develop an individualized exercise program and schedule appointments with the patient at
      home including goal setting discussion. Participants will be offered free YMCA membership to
      participate in the IN Motion program.The IN Motion program is designed for older adults and
      include gentle fit, hydrotherapy and walk fit classes along with health education sessions.
      Participants will be taught how to monitor their own heart rate and level of exertion using
      the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion 10-point Scale. All participants will be encouraged to
      exercise at least 3 times per week for 45-60 minutes either at home and/or at YMCA IN Motion
      classes. The home exercise will incorporate aerobic, resistance training, flexibility and
      balance components. Patients will be provided with and asked to keep an exercise log-book.

      Cognitive-behavioral Change Strategy and education:

      Cognitive Behavioral Change Strategies (CBCS) may be an effective way to facilitate coaching
      strategies to increase participant exercise levels. In the current study, modules will be
      presented to participants in the event that they express any barriers to exercise. These
      barriers will vary based on: the individual, environment, and previous exercise behaviors.
      Throughout the intervention, CBC will be performed and administered by the Kinesiologist at
      home visits prior to the participants scheduled surgery. The administration of the modules
      will be dependent on the challenges that the participants express in relation to exercise
      (i.e., lack of time, motivation, social support, etc.). A definition of each strategy will
      be given to the participant; the Kinesiologist will then work through a worksheet with the
      participant. Also, the study kinesiologist will provide education to the participants about
      exercise, hip arthroplasty and osteoarthritis.

      Protein Supplement: Participants will be provided with twice-daily supplements (containing
      20 gram protein, 1.5 g β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate /serving) to be taken with a meal or on
      activity days within 3-hours of exercise.

      Vitamin D: All participants in the intervention arm will be provided with a supply of
      Vitamin D3 (1000 IU/day tablets) for the duration of the intervention period.

      Medication Review: After randomization, a geriatrician will review the medications for
      patients in the intervention arm and provide written recommendations to the participant's
      family doctor.

      Control arm: Patients in the control arm will receive usual care which may include the
      recommendation to attend fitness classes before surgery; however these patients will not
      receive the more intensive assessment/intervention of the Kinesiologist and other
      intervention components. Control participants will be asked pre-operatively and
      post-operatively to indicate whether or not they exercise, take protein or vitamin
      supplements.

      For participants in intervention and control groups will, 1) be monitored for their YMCA
      attendance and 2) be instructed on the completion a dietary intake log that indicate the
      type of food and amount over a four-day period in order to calculate energy and
      micronutrient consumption. Then a RA will call the participants to collect their food
      intake.
