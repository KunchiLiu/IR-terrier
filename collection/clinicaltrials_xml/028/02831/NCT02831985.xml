  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of children with otitis media undergo surgery with ventilation tubes (VTs)
      placed in the tympanic membrane. This is done to improve hearing and speech development and
      to reduce ear complaints. The long-term results of VTs are unclear. Follow-up care is
      required to assure that the tubes are functional, hearing loss has been corrected, and
      potential complications are properly diagnosed and managed. Guidelines regarding follow-up
      care give different advices concerning when, how and by whom the controls should be made.

      The primary goal of this study is to investigate if follow-up care after surgery with VTs of
      children aged 2-12 years can be done by general practitioners instead of specialists without
      negative consequences for the patient.

      In the study the child`s hearing and speech development, middle ear function, subjective
      complaints and complications will be assessed. User satisfaction and other aspects related
      to the quality of control will also be assessed.

      If the study shows that follow-ups after surgery with VTs can be done on the level of
      primary care without loss of care quality, specialist health care services will be spared
      and cost-effectiveness for the overall healthcare system will improve.
