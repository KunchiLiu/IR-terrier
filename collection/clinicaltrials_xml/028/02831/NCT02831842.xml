      This non-interventional study will meta-analyze overall survival outcomes among the
      participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with available V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) status, who received firstline treatment with
      bevacizumab containing treatment regimen in routine clinical practice. The study leveraging
      secondary data from existing cohorts in the United Stats of America (USA), Germany,
      Australia, and Denmark.
