  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies have compared spinal anesthetic performed supine versus lateral, with
      varying results, in parturients having elective cesarean section. Needle positioning during
      spinal placement has also been examined. No positioning techniques have demonstrated
      definitive superiority for hemodynamic stability.

      Investigators propose that following spinal placement in the sitting position if the patient
      is placed in a lateral position for 90 seconds prior to turning them supine, hemodynamic
      changes caused by sympathectomy related to the subarachnoid block can be avoided.

      This is the first study to examining the influence of position changes after spinal
      anesthetic placement in the sitting position, which includes hemodynamic variables not
      previously studied including cardiac output, (total peripheral resistance) TPR, TSF, and
      pulse pressure variation (PPV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is chosen when natural spontaneous vaginal delivery is either not possible
      or when the health of the baby or mother is compromised. Cesarean section may be planned,
      urgent, or performed emergently when the life of the baby or mother is threatened.

      Cesarean section is performed using different anesthetic techniques including: spinal,
      epidural, combined spinal and epidural, and general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia is the
      most common technique chosen due to its relative safety, rapid onset and avoidance of
      potential complications from general anesthesia. It is the technique of choice for elective
      cesarean section unless contraindicated. Spinal anesthesia causes sympathetic blockade
      followed by sensory and motor blockade. Nerve fiber size explains the speed of onset and
      differential block. The critical moments during spinal anesthesia come as soon as local
      anesthetic is injected into the subarachnoid space.
