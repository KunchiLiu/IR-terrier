  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new interdental cleaning device
      (Soft-Picks Advanced), as compared to a leading brand floss; and, how ease of use can
      promote the establishment of a hygienic routine of cleaning interproximal spaces.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Soft-Picks Advanced has a new curved design allowing a user to easily access to
      difficult interdental sites, such as spaces between premolars and molars. This study is a
      single center with parallel design, single blinded, which will randomize eligible subjects
      into two treatment groups.
