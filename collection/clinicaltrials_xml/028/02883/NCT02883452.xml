  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new subcutaneous infliximab formulation is being developed by Celltrion, Inc. as an
      alternative to the intravenous regimen where subcutaneous infliximab injection typically
      takes less than 2 minutes. The availability of a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab
      would increase the treatment options available to patients, particularly those wishing to
      self-administer their therapy [Jackisch et al. 2014]. This Phase 1 randomized, open-label,
      multicenter, parallel-group study is designed to evaluate efficacy, pharmacokinetics and
      safety between CT-P13 SC and CT-P13 IV in patients with active CD or active UC.
