    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without
      atezolizumab before surgery works in treating patients with newly diagnosed, stage II-III
      triple negative breast cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may block tumor
      growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Giving carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without atezolizumab before surgery may make the
      tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that the combination of chemotherapy and atezolizumab will
      increase tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) percentage compared to chemotherapy alone in
      patients with newly diagnosed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) being treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that the combination of chemotherapy and atezolizumab will
      increase the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate compared to chemotherapy alone in
      patients with newly diagnosed TNBC being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate potential biomarkers of response to chemotherapy in combination with
      atezolizumab in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC.

      II. To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab on the immune
      response in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC.

      III. To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab on
      neoantigen-specific T cell responses in patients with newly diagnosed TNBC.

      IV. To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy in combination with atezolizumab on long-term
      clinical endpoints such as overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients
      with newly diagnosed TNBC.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour, and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both arms, within 3-6 weeks, patients undergo mastectomy or lumpectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
