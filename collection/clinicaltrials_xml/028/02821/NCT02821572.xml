  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune thrombocytopenia, also called immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an
      autoimmune disease, characterized by the peripheral destruction of platelets of
      immunological origin and the inappropriate medullar production of platelets.

      Monocytes/macrophages play a double role by phagocyting platelets recognized by
      autoantibodies and by maintaining the autoimmune response via their function as antigen
      presenting cells. The functions of macrophages are partially regulated by binding with
      Immunoglobulin G at their receptors (FcγR) which could be inhibiting, FcγRIIb, or activating
      (FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIII). Therefore, a disequilibrium in the FcγRIIa/FcγRIIb ration could
      be implicated in ITP, as already reported for other autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) The aim of this project is to compare
      the expression of FcγR in patients with ITP who have been treated with rituximab with that
      in matched healthy subjects. A correlation between relative expression of these different
      FcγR (FcγRIIa/FcγRIIb ratio) and the response to splenectomy and to rituximab will be
      studied.

      This study is interventional because of a lots of blood sample The results of our study will
      in due course make it possible to define predictors of the response to treatments, so as to
      better identify patients likely to benefit from these different treatments.
