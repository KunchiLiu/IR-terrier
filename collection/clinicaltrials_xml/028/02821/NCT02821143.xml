    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that telemedicine may be an effective tool to improve palliative
      care in nursing home, by providing on-site specialized and interprofessional consultation.
      The objective of this study is to assess the impact of telemedicine in decreasing the rate
      of hospitalization, compared with usual care, in nursing home resident with palliative care
      needs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to current statistics, approximately 12 % of all deaths in France occur in Nursing
      Home, with the number over 25% in USA. With the ageing of the population, this rate is
      expected to dramatically increase in the next years, to reach 40% in USA in 2020. Yet, there
      is some evidence that palliative care is often inadequate in Nursing Home: there is a
      difficulty to recognize residents who might benefit palliative care and their needs, an
      underassessment and under-treatment of pain and other end-of-life symptoms, and frequent
      burdensome treatments and hospitalizations. Several programs including palliative care
      consult service (with outside consultant), Nursing Home-based palliative care or Nursing
      Home-hospice partnerships, have succeeded in delivering high-quality palliative care in
      Nursing Home. But, to our knowledge, no studies examined the benefit of telemedicine for
      palliative care in nursing home.

      During a 6 month-inclusion period, residents with palliative care needs will be included in
      both arms. In the intervention group, Telemedicine consultations involving Nursing Home
      staff and the palliative and/or geriatric unit from the University Hospital, will be
      organized systematically at inclusion and during the follow-up if needed. In both groups,
      hospitalizations and emergency hospitalizations, quality of life of the resident,
      satisfaction of the nursing home staff and health costs will be recorded during 6 months.

    <description>Establishment of an initial multiprofessional Telemedicine consultation involving a palliative care physician and / or geriatrician, and other physician coordinator of nursing homes, health care team and if possible the patient's treating physician (patient and / or family may participate if they want to).
The aim is to define and formalize:
Aid to collection and application of advanced directives according to Leonetti Act if the resident is able to do so, or collection of confidence personal choices.
Definition of the objectives of care and patient's life and therapeutic adaptation with a focus on pain and uncomfortable symptoms.
Access to a mobile team of palliative care or geriatric hospitalization at home, a hospice network, if the patient's situation requires.
In case of medical worsening :
Possibility of access to consultations and use of emergency by tele-expertise or decision support within a maximum period of 72 hours, with the same objectives that above.</description>
