      The aim of this study is to find out the impact of a locally designed and manufactured
      improved stove intervention on the level of household air pollution and the impact on
      associated respiratory health indicators and predictors of women and children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Solid fuels used for cooking are a major cause of household air pollution. . Recent data
      from India suggests that the use of solid fuels was responsible for 20% of the total deaths
      among children in the age group, 1-4 years. Women, on the other hand, are three times more
      likely to develop COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). A particular vulnerable
      group are slum dwelling communities, where not only financial constraints and poor living
      conditions contribute to the use of solid fuels, but the lack of proper infrastructure
      forces households to use solid fuels for indoor cooking Also, slum dwelling communities are
      extremely crowded and open space is virtually non-existent which forces household to cook
      inside their house, even during dry-season, resulting in an even more increased exposure.

      Noting the significant health impact of the use of solid fuels and traditional cooking
      systems on (public) health indicators, it is imperative to find clean cooking solutions for
      urban slum dwelling communities. While several efforts have been made to reduce indoor air
      pollution in India, most efforts focused on &quot;enhancing stove energy efficiency, and not
      reducing emissions.&quot; Also, use of a strict top-down approach in the community was
      responsible for many unsuccessful projects. The current project is based on principles of
      co-creation, involving the local community in designing and producing clean cook stoves; a
      more scalable and sustainable solution than fully subsidized efforts.

      The aim is to find out the impact of a locally designed and manufactured improved stove
      intervention on the level of household air pollution and the impact on associated
      respiratory health indicators and predictors of women and children. The specific objectives
      are:

        1. To test if PDSA-cycles (Plan-Do-Study-Act) improve local design, development and
           implementation of cooking stoves based on co-creation.

        2. To know the impact of an improved cooking stove on the levels of household air
           pollution

        3. To know the impact of an improved cooking stove on the respiratory health of women and
           children?

        4. To know and monitor if there are any changes in behavioural and environmental practices
           of slum dwellers following introduction of improved cook stoves (ICSs)?

        5. To know the compliance towards the ICS?

        6. To know the perceived barriers and facilitators for the adoption of improved cookstove
           in the slum dwellers?

      The study will be conducted in two urban slums in Bangalore, India: Peenya and Ashrayanagar
      slum. The study design will be a randomised controlled intervention trial. The investigators
      plan to do a pilot study to test the stove prototype before implementing it on a larger
      scale. This pilot study will be done using a PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) approach. The study
      will comprise of two phases- Phase 1: PDSA phase and Phase 2: RCT (Randomised Controlled
      Trial)

      Phase 1 consists of an iterative process which will assess the impact of a finalized model
      of an improved cook stove on the health and household air pollution of the participating
      households from a test slum in Bangalore. This phase will take into account the inputs from
      the participants and the location itself, and accordingly the cook stove will undergo
      modification. Phase 1 is planned for 6 months during which it may have 2-3 PDSA cycles.
      Following the analysis of Phase 1, a larger longitudinal RCT will be conducted (Phase 2) in
      a larger slum with similar characteristics as the test slum.

      Block randomization will be performed during the RCT to establish two groups: one
      intervention group receiving a new improved cook stove and the other acting as a control
      group. A field team will actively recruit households, assessing eligibility for the RCT and
      collecting baseline survey data. For Phase 1, the investigators would randomly select 20
      households to participate in the PDSA-trials. For Phase 2, a randomized sample of 250
      households will be selected.

      At the onset of both Phase 1 and Phase 2, a baseline household survey study will be
      conducted among the eligible households to obtain data of the respiratory health
      indicators/predictors (FEV1, FVC, symptoms of respiratory morbidity) and Household Air
      Pollution [indoor/ambient Carbon monoxide (CO), Particulate Matter (PM2.5)] of the sample
      population. It will also provide socio-demographic data , possible confounders and effect
      modifiers, symptoms of exposure to air pollutants such as burning eyes and headaches. All
      other symptoms or conditions considered to be relevant by participants will be recorded.
      Spirometry would be done twice, once at the beginning (before the intervention) as part of
      the baseline data, and another at the end of the intervention. Data collection will be
      performed during the baseline survey, and every 2 months after introduction of the cook
      stove during Phase 1 and at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12 months during Phase 2.

      Data entry and analysis will be done side by side. An intention-to-treat analysis will be
      conducted in order to ensure external validity of the study and minimize bias. For missing
      observations, &quot;last value carried forward &quot; method will be used. Personal, household and
      community characteristics will be controlled for.
