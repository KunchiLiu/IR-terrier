  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of daratumumab to
      lenalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (RVd) will increase the proportion of subjects
      achieving stringent complete response (sCR), as defined by the International Myeloma Working
      Group (IMWG) criteria, by the time of completion of post autologous stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT) consolidation treatment, compared with RVd alone.
