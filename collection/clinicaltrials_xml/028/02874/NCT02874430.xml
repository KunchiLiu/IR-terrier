    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well metformin hydrochloride works together with doxycycline
      in treating patients with localized breast or uterine cancer. Metformin hydrochloride may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Doxycycline may stop the growth of bacteria by keeping them from making proteins and
      minimized the toxic side effects of anti-cancer therapy. It is not yet known whether giving
      metformin hydrochloride together with doxycycline may be a better way in treating patients
      with localized breast or uterine cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if treatment with a combination of metformin hydrochloride (metformin) and
      doxycycline can increase the percentage of cells that express caveolin-1 in the cancer
      associated fibroblasts of patients with breast or uterine cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of metformin and doxycycline treatment on the percentage of cells
      that express monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)4 in cancer associated fibroblasts and MCT1
      and transporter of outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM)20 in the cancer cells of breast and
      uterine cancer patients.

      II. To assess safety and tolerability of metformin and doxycycline treatment in subjects
      with breast and uterine cancer.

      III. To determine the relationship of the percentage of stromal cells expressing caveolin
      (CAV)1 or MCT4 and tumor cells that express MCT1 and TOMM20 at baseline and after treatment
      with metformin and doxycycline with the percentage of cells expressing estrogen receptor
      (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) for breast and uterine samples and human epidermal
      growth factor (HER)2 in breast cancer samples.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of combined metformin and doxycycline therapy on the metabolic
      profile of cancer cells and stroma using mass spectroscopy imaging (MSI) on paired samples,
      comparing metabolite profiles in the pre-metformin and post-metformin tumor sample.

      II. To assess the impact of a patient's nutritional status, estimated using 3-day dietary
      recall versus caloric needs as calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation on the baseline
      and net change in CAV1.

      III. To assess the effect of combined metformin and doxycycline therapy on oncomiR micro
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) (miR-21) after intervention.

      IV. To assess the effect of combined metformin and doxycycline therapy on adipokines and the
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1/insulin signaling pathways through assessment of serum
      triglycerides, IGF-1, IGF-binding protein (BP)3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),
      adiponectin, leptin, IGF-1 receptor (R), exosome evaluation, metabolomics profile, and
      microRNA expression profile.
