  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether treatment with sacubitril/valsartan provides a superior effect on
      aortic characteristic impedance compared to enalapril in patients with heart failure and
      reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] â‰¤ 40%) after 12 weeks
      of treatment. The primary endpoint is the change in aortic characteristic impedance (Zc =
      dP/dQ in early systole) between baseline and Week 12.

    <description>Aortic characteristic impedance, Zc, is the ratio of the change in pressure (dP)produced by a given change in flow (dQ) in early systole, i.e., Zc = dP/dQ. Zc is related directly to aortic wall stiffness and inversely to lumen area.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of HTN and one of the following at BOTH screening and pre-randomization:

               1. SBP &gt;105 mm Hg on antihypertensive medication.

               2. SBP &gt;/= 140 mm Hg and NOT on antihypertensive medication.

          -  NYHA class I-III heart failure and with reduced ejection fraction &lt;/= 40%.

          -  On stable doses of treatment with guideline-directed therapy, other than ACEis and
             ARBs prior to randomization.

               1. If the patient is currently taking an ACEi, a 36-hour washout is required prior
                  to randomization (Visit 2).

               2. If the patient is currently taking an ARB, they must discontinue the ARB before
                  initiation of study treatment however washout is not required.

          -  On an optimal medical regiment of diuretics and background medications to effectively
             treat co-morbidities such as HTN, DM, and coronary artery disease.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drigs, including history of
             hypersensitivity to drugs of similar chemical classes, or allergy to ACEis, ARBs, or
             NEP inhibitors as well as known or suspected contraindications to the study drugs.

          -  Previous history of intolerance to sacubitril and valsartan, ACEi or ARB standard of
             care doses despite appropriate and gradual up-titration.

          -  History of angioedema, drug-related or otherwise.

          -  Requirement of treatment with both ACE inhibitor and ARB.

          -  Current or prior treatment with sacubitril and valsartan.
