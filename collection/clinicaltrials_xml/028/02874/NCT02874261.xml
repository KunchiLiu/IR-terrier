    <textblock>
      Whole-body periodic acceleration (WBPA) is a new, non-invasive, and promising therapy for a
      diverse and growing list of disorders including cardiovascular disease. During WBPA,
      patients lie in the supine position on a bed that is capable of translating back and forth
      parallel to the ground, along the head-to-foot axis of the patient. Thus, this treatment is
      best described as a form of &quot;passive exercise.&quot; The frequency of the translation (up to 180
      cycles/minute; cpm) as well as the distance traveled (2-24mm) by the bed can be adjusted by
      the patient or health care professional.

      The science behind the therapeutic effects of WBPA still remains largely unknown.

      We are observing how WBPA may impact on sleep and activity in individuals with PD

      Sleep disturbances are common in individuals with PD. Whole-body periodic acceleration
      (WBPA) is a new, non-invasive, and promising therapy for a diverse and growing list of
      disorders. During WBPA, patients lie in the supine position on a bed that is capable of
      translating back and forth parallel to the ground, along the head-to-foot axis of the
      patient. Thus, this treatment is best described as a form of &quot;passive exercise.&quot; WBPA has
      been shown in previous studies to increase nitric oxide. Increased levels of nitric oxide
      have been shown to improve sleep patterns in other populations. The current pilot study will
      investigate how WBPA will impact upon sleep disturbances in subjects with PD who suffer from
      abnormal sleep patterns. We will record sleep patterns and activity levels using a Jawbone
      U3Â® activity monitor.
