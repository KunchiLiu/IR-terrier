    <textblock>
      Since the end of 2015 an epidemic of ZIKA virus (ZIKV) infections is occurring in the
      Antilles-Guyana departments and focuses our attention on ZIKV and the risk of transmission
      during assisted reproductive technologies (ART). The importance of this epidemic and the
      presence in mainland of its mosquito vector (Aedes albopictus) point out the risk of a
      geographic extension of this infection. In this context the use of Medically Assisted
      Procreation leads to several questions when patients are infected. The question surges for
      patients (women and men) who live in epidemic areas but also for people who return from
      these regions and many other countries within the epidemic area (principally south and
      central America) and who need ART. Information about localization of ZIKV in the genital
      tract or shedding is poorly documented. Only two case reports detected ZIKV RNA in the semen
      and a sexual transmission was described. However, there is no data on the duration of the
      presence of ZIKV in semen and on localization of ZIKV in semen compartments (cells, seminal
      plasma, spermatozoa). The purpose of this study is to seek the presence of ZIKV in semen, to
      determine its localization and to assess the efficiency of spermatozoa processing methods to
      obtain virus free spermatozoa.

      This is a prospective study involving 15 patients, with acute ZIKV infection and a positive
      RNA detection in blood or/and urines (Institut Pasteur, Pointe-à-Pitre). Men will give
      semen, urine and blood specimens 7 days after the beginning of clinical signs and 11, 20,
      30, 60 and 90 days after. ZIKV RNA being diagnosed with blood and/or urine sample positive
      for ZIKV RNA. ZIKV RNA will be detected in seminal plasma, native semen cells and processed
      spermatozoa. Semen sampling and processing will be performed within the ART laboratory of
      the hospital of Pointe-à-Pitre (Guadeloupe) and research of ZIKV RNA in the laboratory of
      Virology of Toulouse University Hospital. This study will identify the presence or absence
      of ZIKV seminal shedding and in case of shedding, verify the efficiency of semen processing
      to obtain virus free spermatozoa.

      These results are important to understand the physiopathology of ZIKV infection and will
      help to define the management and viral safety procedures during Medically assisted
      Procreation in the context of ZIKV epidemic.
