  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of iFIT Prosthetics, LLCÂ® was to create and commercialize a modular, immediate fit,
      fully adjustable, transtibial prosthesis system suitable for mass production using high
      strength injection molded polymer materials. This goal was achieved and the aim of this
      project is now to conduct a feasibility and effectiveness study and to assess the design of
      the device. The investigators will be fitting up to 30 transtibial amputees that are current
      prosthesis users with the iFIT device. Patients will wear the device for 2 weeks and
      evaluate for comfort, stability and ease of use as compared to their conventional device.
      The investigators will also be obtaining socket pressures and gait biomechanics of
      participants wearing both devices.

    <description>Comparison of subject ratings from the iFIT device and their conventional devices in the domains of: comfort, fit, ease of use, pain and functionality on a 7 question 35 point scale. Subjects will grade these domains for the prototype as well as their conventional prosthesis to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the device.</description>
