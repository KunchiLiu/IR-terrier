      Guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists for atrial fibrillation
      whenever the CHADS2VASC score is superior or equal to 2. As there are no specific guidelines
      for the hemodialysis patients with atrial fibrillation, the general guidelines apply.
      However, several retrospective studies suggest that these patients do not benefit from the
      oral anticoagulation regarding the risk of stroke and may even experience more bleedings and
      deaths.

      The aim of this prospective study is to prospectively compare the hemorrhagic and thrombotic
      risks of oral anticoagulation in comparison with no anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients
      with atrial fibrillation.

    <description>VKA use as recommended in the guidelines with INR target range between 2 and 3. Daily administration or thrice weekly at the end of dialysis sessions upon Nephrologist's choice.
Antiplatelet therapy will be provided only if recent acute coronary syndrome (&lt; 6 months) or active coronary stent. Aspirin should be preferred in dialysis patients as clopidogrel has an unpredictable reduced activity and there is no safety data on combination of VKA with prasugrel or ticagrelor in this population.</description>
