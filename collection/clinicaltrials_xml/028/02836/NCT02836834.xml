    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of JS-001 in subjects with
      various advanced or recurrent malignancies, including solid tumors and lymphomas, and to
      evaluate its preliminary efficacy.

      The secondary objectives are to: 1) characterize the single-dose and multi-dose
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of JS-001, 2) characterize the immunogenicity of JS-001; 3)
      assess the dose-efficacy relationship of JS-001 single agent, and 4) preliminarily evaluate
      biomarkers associated with the efficacy of JS-001.

      The exploratory objectives include to evaluate the consistency between biomarker detection
      results of archived tissue and fresh frozen tissue, and to assess the consistency of
      response using various response criteria (such as irRC, WHO, RECIST and irRECIST).

      OVERVIEW This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of JS-001, a humanized
      monoclonal IgG4 antibody targeting the Programmed Death -1 (PD-1). It is estimated that
      27-54 subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors or lymphomas will be enrolled in the
      study.

      A 3+3 design will be utilized for this Phase 1 study. Four dose levels are planned and
      include: 0.3, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg/dose. The first dose level will be a pilot cohort including two
      subjects receiving a single dose of JS-001. Each of the other 3 dose levels will use 3 dose
      schedules: single dose, repeated doses every 2 weeks, and repeated doses every 3 weeks.
      Subjects will be assigned to a dose schedule in the order of study entry.

      Except for the first dose level, the study will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with 3 or 6
      subjects treated at this dose level and at all subsequent dose levels depending upon the
      incidence of DLTs. If no DLTs occur in a cohort of 3 subjects, a new cohort of 3 subjects
      will be treated at the next higher dose level. If 1 of 3 subjects in a cohort experiences a
      DLT, that cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If only 1 of the 6 subjects has a DLT, then
      the next cohort of 3 subjects will be treated at the next higher dose level. If 2 or more
      DLTs occur within a cohort, then that dose level will be above the MTD (the highest dose
      where no more than 1 of 6 subjects has experienced a DLT), and the previous lower
      (tolerated) dose level will be considered the MTD.

      A DLT is defined as a Grade 3 drug-related adverse event occurring within the first cycle
      (28 days) of dosing (excluding tumor flare defined as local pain, irritation, or rash
      localized at sites of known or suspected tumor or a transient Grade 3 infusion adverse
      event) using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) version 4.0 in a single dose cohort.

      Tumor response will be evaluated using immune-related response criteria (irRC), WHO criteria
      , Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), immune-related RECIST, and
      International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (for
      lymphomas only).

      In the absence of confirmed disease progression and intolerable toxicities, subjects in the
      single dose cohorts and multiple dose cohorts will be allowed to continue JS-001
      administration with the consent of the subject.

      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION JS-001 will be administered as a 60-minute i.v. infusion. Cohorts
      will include escalating dose levels of 0.3, 1, 3, 10mg/kg/dose.

      SAFETY EVALUATIONS Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements,
      clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
      evaluations, diagnostic imaging, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and the
      incidence and severity of adverse events.

      Safety will also include evaluations of immune safety and immunogenicity. Particular
      attention will be given to adverse events that may follow enhanced T-cell activation such as
      dermatitis and colitis, uveitis, or other immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

      An irAE is a clinically significant adverse event of any organ that is associated with drug
      exposure, of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism.

      EFFICACY EVALUATIONS The primary efficacy endpoint is the best response rate (RR). Duration
      of response, progression-free survival, time to progression, and overall survival will also
      be analyzed.

      PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS Pharmacokinetic parameters include AUC, Cmax, tmax, and tÂ½, etc.
      STATISTICAL METHODS The sample size for this study is not determined from power analysis. It
      is based on the 3+3 design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements.

      Descriptive statistics will include: mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and
      maximum values for continuous variables; frequencies and percentages for categorical
      variables.

      The efficacy parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics. All safety and
      pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
