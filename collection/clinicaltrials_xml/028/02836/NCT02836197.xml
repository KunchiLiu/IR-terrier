    <textblock>
      Today, oncological care offers more effective and personalized treatments than ever before,
      while cancer patients and their physicians are increasingly confronted with uncertainty.
      Physicians may experience a lot of difficulties to simultaneously address this uncertainty
      with their cancer patients and to support their hope. Although previous studies reported the
      effectiveness of communication skills training designed for health care professionals (CST),
      specific training addressing uncertainty and hope in oncology have not yet been studied.
      This project aims to assess in a randomized study the efficacy of a 30-hour CST program
      addressing uncertainty and hope in oncology and designed for physicians. The efficacy will
      be assessed by analyzing physicians' acquisition of communication skills addressing
      uncertainty and hope in encounters with a simulated advanced stage cancer patient.

      1. Aims of the study Starting from studies addressing the effectiveness of communication
           skills training program in oncology, the current project aims to conduct a randomized
           longitudinal study to assess the efficacy of an intensive communication skills training
           program addressing uncertainty and hope in oncology and designed for physicians. This
           efficacy will be assessed by analyzing physicians' acquisition of communication skills
           addressing uncertainty and hope in encounters with a simulated advanced stage cancer
           patient through validated tools and questionnaires.

        2. State of the art In the last decades, major developments have been achieved in
           oncological care. Cancer patients and their families are now confronted with various
           treatments, including a personalized approach and involving multidisciplinary care.
           These developments allowed getting cancer the status of a chronical disease, putting
           numerous patients in a course alternating between treatment phases and remission
           phases. Numerous cancer patients are also confronted to long term treatments aiming to
           control an advanced disease. These developments support the patients' and physicians'
           hope for an increased life-expectancy. At the same time, they lead them to frequently
           face contexts of high uncertainty regarding their prognosis or the expected and
           unexpected effects of cancer treatments. Although these contexts are complex in terms
           of communication, no studies has yet been conducted to assess the efficacy of a
           communication training program addressing specifically uncertainty and hope in oncology
           and designed for physicians.

        3. Study protocol

      3.1. Subjects To be included in this study, physicians have to speak French and have to be
      willing to participate in the research program. The physicians (n=72) included are
      oncologists, other specialists, and residents with at least one year of experience working
      with cancer patients (part-time or full-time). Recruitment has given priority to physicians
      working at Jules Bordet Institute. The local ethics committee approved this study and all of
      the participants provided written informed consent.

      3.2. Study design Participating physicians will be randomized in two groups. The first group
      of 36 physicians will immediately attend the training program (experimental group). The
      second group of 36 physicians will attend the training in a delayed manner (control group).
      Comparison between the experimental group and the control group will allow highlighting the
      impact of the training on communicational, physiological and psychological variables
      recorded in the context of an encounter with a simulated advanced stage cancer patient. For
      the experimental group, the first recording will take place before the first training
      session and the second recording after the last session. For the control group, the first
      and the second recording will take place with a four-month interval.

      3.3. Communication skills training program The general aim of the training program is to
      help physicians learn effective communication skills in contexts of high uncertainty. The
      specific aims of the training program are to help physicians to talk about uncertainty with
      their cancer patients and to support their hope; to improve general physicians'
      communication's skills; to optimize physician/patient relationship; to help patients to
      better cope with uncertainty; to increase physicians' consciousness regarding their own
      reactions to uncertainty. The training will last 30 hours, will be spread over 4 months.
      This program involves 10 3-hours sessions scheduled according the participants wishes. To
      increase training accessibility to physicians and facilitate participation, the training
      will be conducted by group of 3 subjects. The training will include mainly role-plays,
      theoretical information and modeling techniques. A training manual has been developed to
      increase content standardization and reduce potential group or trainee biases. The
      role-plays will be based on clinical cases brought up by the participants. The communication
      skills taught are based on psychodynamics, cognitive-behavioral and systemic theories. The
      training staff is highly specialized in caregiver/patient communication training programs in
      oncology (Y. Libert and S. Marchal).

      3.4. Assessment procedure In cancer care, patients' performance status, disease status and
      their communication behaviors can widely vary. To reduce these variabilities, the use of
      standardized simulated patient encounters has been recommended to assess the efficacy of
      communication skills training programs designed for health care professionals. The
      assessment procedure of the current study involves the recording of an encounter with a
      simulated advanced stage cancer patient. For the experimental group, the first recording
      will take place before the first training session and the second recording after the last
      session. For the control group, the first and the second recording will take place with a
      four months' interval. Participating physicians will be assessed individually. An
      investigator, who will not be involved in the training program, will present every subject
      with self-assessment scales and experimental tasks associated with this recording. The
      assessment procedure includes 6 steps: a relaxation exercise, a first completion of a set of
      psychological questionnaires, the reading of the simulated patient medical file, a second
      completion of a set of psychological questionnaires, the conduction of the simulated
      encounter, and a third completion of a set of psychological questionnaires,.

      3.4.1. Simulated patient encounter The simulated case was created by the medical oncology
      unit and the psycho-oncology clinic of our cancer center (Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels,
      Belgium). This simulated case was developed in order to increase physicians' uncertainty
      about medico-psycho-social components and available evidence-based treatments. The simulated
      patient chosen for this study is a 36-year-old woman with advanced cancer. She is facing a
      third recurrence (hepatic metastasis) of breast cancer that had previously been treated with
      surgery, hormone therapy, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. She decided to start a new
      chemotherapy treatment in a near future. For the assessment procedure, physicians will be
      instructed that she asked to meet a physician in order to help them better cope with this
      therapeutic decision. During the encounter, physicians are instructed to address concerns of
      the simulated patient, to maintain their professional identity and to take the time they
      need. The simulated patient is played by an actress experienced in simulated patient
      encounters. She has been trained to maintain standardized script and behaviors for each
      encounter. Regular feedback sessions will be organized to help the actress maintain
      reproducibility. During the simulated patient encounter, the actress was instructed to
      explicitly express four concerns: her fear of death in a near future; her fear that the
      chemotherapy that she will start soon will not be effective regarding the disease
      progression; her fear to suffer from a major depression relapse; and a general fear to be
      less available for her children in the next weeks. She will be instructed to express a
      moderate anxiety about each concern. The simulated patient encounters will be organized in
      the communication lab of the Centre de Psycho-Oncologie (Brussels).

      3.4.2. Psychological questionnaires Participating physicians will be asked to fill in a
      first set of psychological questionnaires before reading the simulated patient medical file:
      perceived mastery of communication skills addressing hope and uncertainty in oncology
      (specific questionnaire); and perceived stress (Visual Analogic Scale).

      Participating physicians will be asked to fill in a second set of psychological
      questionnaires immediately before conducting the simulated encounter: perceived stress
      (Visual Analogic Scale); agreement with the therapeutic decision recorded in the simulated
      patient medical file (specific questionnaire); perceived realism of information recorded in
      the simulated patient medical file (specific questionnaire); self-efficacy and perceived
      outcome expectancies regarding communication skills addressing uncertainty and hope that
      they could use when conducting the simulated encounter (specific questionnaire); and
      perceived stress (Visual Analogic Scale).

      Finally, participating physicians will be asked to fill in a third set of psychological
      questionnaires immediately after conducting the simulated encounter: perceived stress
      (Visual Analogic Scale); satisfaction with their communication performance during the
      encounter (specific questionnaire); perceived mastery regarding communication skills
      addressing uncertainty and hope that they used when conducting the simulated encounter
      (specific questionnaire); and perceived stress (Visual Analogic Scale).

      3.4.3. Communication content analyses The simulated encounter will be audio recorded and
      transcribed. Physicians' communication skills will be analyzed using three tools. A French
      communication content analysis software, LaComm (Centre de Psycho-Oncologie, Brussels,
      Belgium; http://www.lacomm.be/) which is a software that analyzes verbal communication (in
      medicine in general and in oncology in particular) utterance by utterance and identifies
      turns of speech and the type and content of utterances. The explanation of how this software
      works has been detailed in a previous publication. The Multidimensional analysis of Patient
      Outcome Predictions (MD.POP) which is a reliable tool used to measure verbal expressions
      that address the clinical future of a patient during medical encounters. This coding system
      allows one to manually identify, code, and score detailed verbal content from a medical
      encounter transcript that informs about the patient's clinical future. The detailed MD.POP
      codebook is available upon request. Finally, a specific interaction-process analysis system
      assessing communication skills addressing hope and uncertainty will be developed for the
      study.

      3.4.4. Physiological assessment Throughout all the assessment procedure, physicians' heart
      rate will be recorded in order to assess the impact of the training program on the
      physiological arousal associated with their ways of addressing uncertainty and hope with the
      simulated patient. This recording procedure has been previously used to assess the effect of
      communication skills training on residents' physiological arousal in a breaking bad news
      simulated task.

      3.5. Data sample and data analyses Training efficacy will be assessed with a higher
      frequency of facilitating communication strategies addressing hope and uncertainty (about
      10%), used by participating physicians during the simulated encounter, a better definition
      of behavioral intentions and a higher physicians' satisfaction about their decisions during
      the encounter. A 72 assessable physicians sample would bring enough statistical power to
      detect this difference. To evaluate the training effect, group-by-time effects will be
      assessed using generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models. Dependent variables
      will be identified as normal, binomial, Poisson, or binomial negative distributions as
      appropriate. All tests will be two-tailed, and alpha will be set at 0.05.
