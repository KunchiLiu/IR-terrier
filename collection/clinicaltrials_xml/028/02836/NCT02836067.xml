      The purpose of this study is to learn how smoking affects the immune systems in people with
      HIV infection. The investigators would like to know if HIV infected smokers who quit smoking
      have different responses in their tissues from people who keep smoking.

             hours of the study procedure for female participants

          -  Active malignancy

          -  Significant immunological illnesses/deficiencies

          -  Use of any immunomodulatory agents within 30 days prior to study enrollment.

          -  Recent active illness (2 months)

          -  History of tuberculosis, lung cancer, asthma and bronchiectasis COPD GOLD Stage 3-4
             based on screening spirometry. Subjects who meet all the inclusion and exclusion
             criteria above will undergo spirometry.

          -  Aim 1: Only HIV smokers with no diagnosis of COPD; normal spirometry and FEV1/FVC
             &gt;0.7.

             enrolled.

          -  All screened participants with known COPD or spirometry diagnosis of GOLD Stage 3-4
             will be excluded due to safety of bronchoscopy.
