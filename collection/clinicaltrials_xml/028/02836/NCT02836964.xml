      To evaluate the clinical success, stability, radiographic bone level changes and
      peri-implants soft tissue parameter of the SLActive surface implant supporting single crowns
      restorations in early loading in the mandibular first molar region.

      The human clinical trial will be designed as a longitudinal prospective study. A total of 24
      titanium implants with a modified SLA surface (BLT SLActive®, Institute Straumann AG, Basel,
      Switzerland) will be placed in the mandibular first molar. 12 for the control group and for
      the 12 test group.
