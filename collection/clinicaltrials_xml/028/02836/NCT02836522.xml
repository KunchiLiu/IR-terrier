        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consented to the ANCHOR trial as per self-report and by providing a valid referral
             code on the information sheet provided by the referring site. Both men and women from
             the ANCHOR trial will be recruited to this study.

          -  English fluent as we are only validating this measure in English at this time

          -  At least one month post-treatment for anal HSIL as per self-report, or if the person
             is in the ANCHOR trial observation arm, then at least one month post- randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a scheduled ANCHOR follow-up appointment in the next two weeks as per self
             report. The purpose of this exclusion criterion is to minimize the impact on a
             participant's responses to a post-test evaluation the potential occurrence of an
             interim diagnosis or treatment event, or anxiety related to an upcoming medical
             follow-up.
