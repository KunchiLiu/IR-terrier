    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well smoking cessation intervention works in
      reducing surgical complications in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer who smoke
      cigarettes. This study will use two smoking cessation interventions: Varenicline (a drug
      that reduces the craving and withdrawal symptoms that occur with abstinence from nicotine)
      with behavioral interventions (consisting of a brief clinician-delivered intervention and
      tobacco quitline [tobacco cessation service available through a toll-free telephone number]
      follow-up) with placebo (a pill with no active medication) along with the same behavioral
      interventions. It is not yet known whether smoking cessation intervention prior to surgery
      is effective in reducing surgical complications for these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial evaluating
      varenicline vs. placebo for reduction in post-surgical complications through 24 weeks after
      surgery in lung cancer patients who undergo surgery and are motivated to stop smoking. A
      parallel group design will be utilized for this two-arm study: varenicline vs. placebo. Both
      arms will also include a brief no smoking message from the surgical team and the NCI
      Quitline. Patients will be stratified into two groups based on the type of resection
      planned: minimally invasive (could include lobectomy and robotic surgery) and other. The
      primary and secondary objectives are provided below.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine if varenicline plus a behavioral intervention consisting of a brief
      clinician-delivered intervention and tobacco quitline follow-up, decreases postsurgical
      complications through 24 weeks after surgery when compared to placebo plus the behavioral
      intervention in lung cancer patients who undergo surgery and are motivated to stop smoking.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To compare changes from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks after surgery in the patient
           quality of life (LASA-12) domains between the intervention (varenicline) and control
           group (placebo).

        2. To compare changes from baseline to 6, 12 and 24 weeks after surgery in the patient
           quality of life related domains for the PHQ-9 and SEQ12 between the intervention and
           control groups.

        3. To compare the proportion of patients 12 weeks and 24 weeks after surgery who endorse
           (&quot;Was It Worth It&quot;) each treatment (intervention vs. control groups).

        4. To compare post-operative care (as measured by length of hospital and high dependency
           unit stay) between the intervention and control groups.

        5. To compare treatment adherence between the intervention and control groups.

        6. To compare rates of smoking abstinence between the intervention and control groups as a
           covariate of the primary outcome only.
