  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel digital image
      enhancement (DIE) technology in reducing the radiation exposure to both the patient and
      surgical staff during standard intramedullary nail placement for treatment of hip fractures.
      Secondarily, to evaluate whether the image quality and reproducibility of desired images can
      be improved with use of the DIE technology. Finally, to evaluate whether DIE technology
      reduces total operative time.
