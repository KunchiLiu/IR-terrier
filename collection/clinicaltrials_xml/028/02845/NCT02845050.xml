          3. Histologically confirmed muscle-invasive urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder
             (MIBC) with clinical T2-T4a (N0/Nx, M0) assessed by primary PDD-guided TUR-B and by
             the screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          4. Confirmed adequate complete resection of all visible tumor during TUR-B according to
             current treatment guidelines before registration; the latest TUR-B must have been
             done ≤ 8 weeks before registration

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 12 g/dL for the safety phase of the study; if the study treatment
                  proved to be adequate tolerated during this safety phase, the threshold can be
                  lowered to ≥ 10 g/dL according to the decision of the study steering committee

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000 mm3

               -  Serum albumin within normal range

          7. Absence of psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule;
             these conditions should be assessed with the patient before registration

          8. Electrocardiogram (ECG) without modifications that suggest a high risk of occurrence
             of an acute clinical event (such as signs of angina pectoris or high-risk arrhythmia,

             CTCAE v.4.03

          6. Any concurrent chronic system immune therapy or previous organ allograft

          7. Weight loss &gt; 5 % within the last 3 months before registration

          8. Any other serious illness or medical condition including:

               -  Infection requiring systemic anti-infective therapy within the last 2 weeks
                  before registration

             itraconazole, ritonavir, amprenavir, indinavir, rifampicine) or phenytoine;
             replacement of such treatment with alternative treatment options before start of
             study treatment is acceptable, if medically feasible and ethically acceptable

         11. Treatment with hexamethylmelamin, pyridoxine, penicillamine or any other drug with
