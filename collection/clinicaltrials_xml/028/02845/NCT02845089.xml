             currently alive or deceased

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced/metastatic NSCLC (squamous,
             non-squamous or NOS) stages IIIB/IV. First diagnosis of advanced/metastatic NSCLC
             between 01-Jan-2010 and 31-Mar-2014 (currently alive or deceased) with a minimum 12

             patient follow-up/contact. This also includes documentation of treatment by other
             physicians and inpatient hospital treatments within KSA or the Health Authority of
             Abu Dhabi (HAAD) system

          -  Patients must have at least all data on age, gender, date of advanced NSCLC
             diagnosis, Line of Treatment (LOT) information (agent types and dosage), and date of
             last follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient had enrolled in a cancer treatment-related clinical study at any time after
