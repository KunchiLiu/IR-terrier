    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of comparing outcomes of patients
      treated de novo with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) versus matched unrelated donor (MUD)
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for pediatric acquired severe aplastic anemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major challenge in treating pediatric Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) is the determination of
      best primary therapy for patients who lack a fully matched related donor for HSCT. Good
      survival outcomes have been seen with IST, but initial and late failures, CSA dependence,
      persistent cytopenias and secondary Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) / Acute Myeloid Leukemia
      (AML) in a portion of patients leave considerable room for improvement. MUD HSCT survival in
      SAA has markedly improved, but a direct comparison of this approach with IST is necessary to
      determine whether this approach is feasible and will lead to better Event Free Survival.
      This trial will address the feasibility of randomization, test whether patients can be
      evaluated in a timely fashion and safely begin therapy with MUD HSCT or IST, and give a
      preliminary assessment of the safety of up-front MUD HSCT. If successful, this trial will
      lead to a future prospective trial comparing directly IST to MUD HSCT in this disease.

             function inclusion criteria for HSCT listed in section 2.3.4 by the intended time of
             HSCT (6-8 weeks after randomization) or preclude patients from receiving horse ATG.

          1. Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). The diagnosis of Fanconi anemia must
             be excluded by diepoxybutane (DEB) or equivalent testing on peripheral blood or
             marrow. Dyskeratosis congenita must be excluded by testing of telomere
             length,Shwachman Diamond syndrome must be excluded by testing serum trypsinogen in
             patients age &lt;3 or or isoamylase for children ≥3 (see section 4.2.3.1 for details of
             the required evaluations to exclude IBMFS).

          2. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities or fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) pattern
             consistent with pre-myelodysplastic syndrome (pre-MDS) or MDS on marrow examination
             (see section 4.2.3.1 for details of the required MDS FISH panel).

          3. Known severe allergy to horse ATG.

          4. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          5. Prior solid organ transplant.

          6. Seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          7. Active Hepatitis B or C determined by serology and/or NAT.

          8. Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          9. Prior malignancies except resected basal cell carcinoma or treated cervical carcinoma
             in situ.
