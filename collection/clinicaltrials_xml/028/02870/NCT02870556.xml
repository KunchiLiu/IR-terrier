  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) is the most commonly reported postoperative complication in
      total laryngectomy patients. PCF significantly increases morbidity, length of
      hospitalization, and cost of care, in addition to delaying the beginning of adjuvant
      therapy. The reported incidence of PCF ranges from 3% to 65%.The increased use of radiation
      in the primary management of laryngeal carcinoma has resulted in an increase in the PCF
      formation after salvage laryngectomy (STL).

      Previously reported risk factors for PCF development include preoperative radiotherapy,
      tumor stage, concomitant neck dissection, prior need for tracheotomy, hypoalbuminemia and
      anemia.

      Among surgical options, the pectoralis major myofascial flap has been proposed to cover the
      pharyngeal closure, to interpose non-irradiated tissue between the neopharynx and the skin
      during STL. Nonetheless, the efficacy of this approach is not fully established.Epidural
      anesthesia improves the blood supply due to its vasodilating effect. The aim of the study is
      to evaluate the effect of perioperative cervical epidural analgesia on the occurrence of
      pharyngocutaneous fistula following salvage laryngectomy and reconstruction with pectoralis
      major myocutaneous flap.

      Patients will be divided into two equal groups, group (EP), will receive perioperative
      cervical epidural analgesia in addition to general anesthesia and group (GA) will receive
      general anesthesia and postoperative analgesia through patient controlled intravenous
      morphine analgesia (PCA), that involve 1 mg continuous infusion and 2 mg boluses with
      lockout interval 10 min.

      Cervical epidural technique: epidural needle will be inserted at C 6-C7 or C7-T1 under
      fluoroscopy in prone position, 6 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine and fentanyl 2 mic/ ml will be
      administered before skin incision followed by 4 ml of the same injectate, will be infused
      continously for 2 days
