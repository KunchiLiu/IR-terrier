  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of SUPRAFLEX to that of
      XIENCE in an all-comers patient population with symptomatic ischemic heart disease. The
      patients will be followed through 3 years for major clinical events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, 1:1 balanced, controlled, single-blind, multi-center
      study comparing clinical outcomes at 12 months between SUPRAFLEX and XIENCE in a &quot;Real
      world, all comers&quot; patient population (patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease
      including patients with chronic stable angina, silent ischemia, and acute coronary
      syndromes, who qualify for percutaneous coronary interventions). The objective is to compare
      the SUPRAFLEX SES with the XIENCE EES with respect to target lesion failure (TLF) at 12
      months in a non-inferiority trial in a &quot;real world&quot; patient population.

      All patients will be (at minimum) contacted at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months post
      procedure to assess clinical status and adverse events. The 30 day and 12 month will be a
      clinic visit. All patients will have annual contact through 3 years follow-up to assess
      clinical status and adverse events.
