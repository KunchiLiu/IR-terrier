  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by decreased strength and motor
      control, and compromised gait function. Reduced walking speed, balance, and fatigue are the
      cardinal symptoms. In rehabilitation, strength and balance training are commonly used. There
      is increasing scientific support of strength training for improving walking function. The
      evidence for balance training remains flawed. It is known that neurological damage in MS
      leads to increased cognitive processing in the planning of movements, which predisposes
      fatigue. Since fatigue is also associated with impaired balance, it can be hypothesized that
      motoric/balance training with an emphasis on cognitive load can affect gait and fatigue.

      Purpose: The aim of the study is to determine whether there is a differentiated effect
      between strength and balance training measured by motor function, strength, balance, and
      fatigue.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>All sessions will start with a ten minute warm-up on either a treadmill or a cycle.
The balance intervention will be conducted in stations/domains where balance is challenged in the five different functions: standing, walking, sit to stand, stepping, and a station that exercises vestibular and gaze control.
Progression is achieved by adding exercises with increased balance requirements and by adding additional motoric and cognitive tasks to the exercisesâ€”dual-tasking.
Intensity of the exercises is defined from an error-rate where an adequate level is 20-40 percent.
The intervention is conducted according to a standardized framework that describes examples of exercises and progressions.</description>

    <description>All sessions will start with a ten minute warm-up on a stationary bicycle, followed by strength training of primary muscle synergies in the lower extremities. All exercises will be performed on machines with patients sitting or lying, adequately supported. The exercises are leg press, knee extension, hip flexion, hamstring curl, and hip extension. Exercises are performed with a fast concentric phase and a slow eccentric phase..
Set, repetition, and load:
Weeks 1 and 2, 3 sets of 10 repetitions at a load of 15 repetitions maximum (RM)
Weeks 3 and 4, 3 sets of 12 repetitions at a load of 12RM
Weeks 5 and 6, 4 sets of 12 repetitions at a load of 12RM
Weeks 7 and 8, 4 sets of 10 repetitions at a load of 10RM
