      Introduction: Field hockey is a contact sport. Semiflexion asymmetric position, along with
      other theories such as the weakness of the extensor muscles of the back or hamstring injury,
      can be causes or aggravating that suelan hockey players suffer back pain. Objectives: To
      observe the effectiveness of manual therapy techniques and post-isometric stretching (PNF)
      after three treatment sessions. In turn, know which of the two treatments have a greater
      benefit and longer. Methods: The population consists of grass hockey players and senior
      category aged between 16-30 years. They were randomly divided into two treatment groups.
      Group 1 corresponded to manual therapy techniques and group 2 to PNF stretching. The study
      duration for each subject was 5 sessions that included 3 treatment and 3 assessments. Each
      evaluation consisted of goniometry, balance test using the Sit and Reach, and Roland Morris
      questionnaire.

    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity was recorded by a visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain. The pain was expressed on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 &quot;maximum tolerable pain.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Goniometry</measure>

    <description>Goniometry of both legs with universal goniometer external and internal rotation of the hip, hip flexion, knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic balance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Was assessed using the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), Which bilateral in the above (A), posteromedial (PM) and posterolateral (PL) Were used reach directions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lumbar flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Was assessed using the Fingertip-to-Floor Test (FFT). Subjects were placed barefoot over a 25-cm high platform, with feet together and flat, and toes on the edge pointing forward. Then, they were asked to bend the trunk from the upright position as far as possible without discomfort, while maintaining knees and arms fully extended. Flexion was held for 3 seconds and the vertical distance between the tip of the middle finger and the platform was measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lumbar disability</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>By Roland Morris questionnaire, is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items. Items were chosen to reflect a variety of activities of daily living. Accordingly, total scores can vary from 0 (no disability) to 24 (severe disability).</description>
