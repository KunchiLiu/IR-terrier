      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      hydrochloride with atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab work in treating patients with ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. block tumor growth Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab
      and bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not
      yet known which combination will work better in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) following cycle 1 of experimental regimens 1 and 2
      (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride [pegylated liposomal doxorubicin] [PLD] and
      atezolizumab and PLD/bevacizumab and atezolizumab). (Safety lead-in) II. Progression-Free
      survival (PFS). (Phase II study) III. Overall survival (OS). (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Objective response rate (ORR, either partial or complete response). (Phase II study) II.
      Safety as measured by frequency and severity of adverse events by Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 4.0. (Phase II study) III. ORR and PFS.
      (Phase III study) IV. Safety as measured by frequency and severity of adverse events by
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4.0. (Phase III study) V. Patient
      Reported outcomes (PRO) as measured by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) ovarian symptom index (NFOSI)-18,
      disease-related symptoms (DRS), treatment side effects (TSE), function/well-being (FWB),
      Neurotoxicity (FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group [GOG]-neurotoxicity [NTX]-4), Fatigue
      (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue [FACIT-F]-9) and Abdominal
      Discomfort (FACT/GOG-abdominal discomfort [AD]). (Phase III study)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether biomarkers in pre-treatment tissue, peripheral blood, and stool
      specimens predict ORR, PFS and/or OS.

      II. To determine whether changes in quantitative biomarker parameters after the first 6 and
      12 weeks of therapy predict ORR, PFS and/or OS.

      OUTLINE: Patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV)
      over 60 minutes on day 1 and atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8.

      ARM II: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1, bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 8, and atezolizumab IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1 and 8.

      ARM III: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes
      on day 1 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 8.

      In all arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
