      The purpose of this study is to compare any good and bad effects of using chemotherapy
      compared to chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery. This study will allow the
      researchers to know whether which approach is better, the same, or worse than the other.

      This is a randomized phase II study to evaluate 18-month overall survival rate in patients
      with borderline resectable cancer of the head of the pancreas using one of the treatment
      regimens. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 vs 1 is a stratification
      factor. The primary and secondary objectives are described below.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate and estimate 18 months overall survival (OS) rate of patients with borderline
      resectable PDAC receiving neoadjuvant therapy consisting of one of the following regimens
      prior to intended surgical resection and adjuvant therapy with 4 cycles of FOLFOX:

        1. Arm 1: 8 cycles of systemic FOLFIRINOX, and/or

        2. Arm 2: 7 cycles of systemic FOLFIRINOX followed by hypofractionated radiation therapy

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate and estimate the R0 resection rates in patients receiving each of the two
           multimodality treatment regimens.

        2. To evaluate and estimate the event-free survival in patients receiving each of the two
           multimodality treatment regimens.

        3. To evaluate and estimate the pathologic compete response (pCR) rates in patients
           receiving each of the two multimodality treatment regimens

        4. To assess the adverse events (AE) profile and safety of each treatment arm.

      Patients will be followed up to 5 years post-registration.

                       mesenteric vein or portal vein and measures ≥ 180° of the circumference of
                       the vessel wall

                    -  Short-segment occlusion of the SMV-PV is present with normal vein above and
                       below the level of obstruction that is amenable to resection and venous
                       reconstruction

                    -  Short segment interface (of any degree) is present between tumor and
                       hepatic artery with normal artery proximal and distal to the interface that

               -  Patients with less extensive disease than the above four (4) criteria are
                  considered potentially resectable and are NOT eligible.

               -  Patients with more extensive disease than the above 4 criteria are considered
                  locally advanced and are NOT eligible.

                  NOT eligible: Any interface between the tumor and the aorta.

               -  See the protocol for additional clarification and definitions of less and more
                  extensive disease.

        Registration Eligibility Criteria:

          1. Disease Status - Confirmation of radiographic stage as borderline resectable disease

                  information.

               -  Chronic concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers is not allowed.
                  Patients must discontinue the drug 14 days prior to the start of study
                  treatment. See the protocol for more information.
