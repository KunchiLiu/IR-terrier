  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical marijuana is commonly prescribed people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) for symptom,
      e.g. spasticity and pain, management. Unfortunately not much is known about its effects
      outside the treatment for these 2 symptoms. Several previous studies have suggested people
      with MS using medical marijuana have lower levels of physical disability and improved
      walking abilities. A major limitation of these previous studies is that the investigators
      used subjective measures of motor function. In this proposed observational case-control
      study the investigators plan to objectively measure multiple domains of motor function, such
      as: fatigue, strength, and walking ability. No marijuana will be brought on to campus or
      given to participants.

      To investigate the effects of medical marijuana usage on physical function the investigators
      will employ an observational case-control design. Cases (MS medical marijuana users) will be
      compared to age, sex, and disease duration matched controls (MS non-cannabis users).
