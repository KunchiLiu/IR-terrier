      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of olaparib and Hsp90 inhibitor
      AT13387 when given together in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other
      places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery or ovarian, fallopian tube, primary
      peritoneal, or triple-negative breast cancer that has come back. Olaparib and Hsp90
      inhibitor AT13387 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTDs) of olaparib and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387
      (AT13387) administered in combination in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxicities associated with
      olaparib and AT13387 administered in combination as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0.

      II. To determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of the combination of olaparib and
      AT13387.

      III. To determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of olaparib and AT13387. IV. To document
      anti-tumor activity of the combination of olaparib and AT13387 as assessed by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and progression free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 (course 0). Beginning in
      course 1, patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months
      for up to 2 years.
