      (TLD) Therapy in subjects with severe, refractory asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, single-arm (non-randomized) study. All patients will undergo a run
      in period on optimal medical therapy as part of eligibility testing. After additional
      baseline screening but prior to the procedure all patients will take a course of steroids
      prior to the procedure. Final determination to initiate treatment will be made after initial
      airway inspection. A total of 30 patients will be treated. Inflammatory biomarkers (washes
      and brushings) will be collected in all patients and bronchoscopic specimens will be
      collected from the last 15 patients. Matching samples will be collected during a required
      bronchoscopic follow up. All patients will be prescribed steroids and antibiotics post
      procedure. All patients will be provided a mobile handheld spirometer to measure and record
      daily peak expiratory flow and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) values both
      before and after treatment to monitor lung function. Patient follow-up will be conducted out
      to 3 years.
