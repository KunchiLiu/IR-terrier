  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is being designed to offer testicular tissue cryopreservation to male
      pediatric patients (0-17 years of age) with fertility threatening medical diagnoses or
      facing surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy that may cause loss of reproductive
      potential.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Testicular tissue cryopreservation is currently considered experimental but offers the only
      opportunity for fertility preservation in pre-pubescent boys faced with a fertility
      threatening diagnosis or treatment plan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be male 0-17 years of age.

          2. Be scheduled to undergo surgery, chemotherapy, drug treatment and/or radiation for
             the treatment or prevention of a medical condition or malignancy with risk of causing
             permanent and complete loss of subsequent testicular function. Risk categories based
             on treatment regimens are indicated below. Investigators will utilize three sources
             to calculate risk: 1.&quot;Fertile Hope - Risks of Azoospermia&quot; brochure that details
             typical agents and treatment regimens in each risk category, or 2. the Summed
             Alkylating Agent dose score, or 3. the Cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose method .
             Because of the complexity of many treatment regimens, patient risk categorization
             will be at the discretion of the investigators.

             a. High Risk i. ≥80% risk of prolonged azoospermia, Fertile Hope Brochure. ii. Summed
             alkylating agent dose score ≥3. iii. Cyclophosphamide equivalent dose ≥7,500mg/m2. b.
             Intermediate risk (21-79% risk of prolonged azoospermia, Fertile Hope). c. Low Risk
             (≤20% risk of prolonged azoospermia, Fertile Hope). d. Eligibility is limited to
             patients in the High risk category.

          3. Or, have a medical condition or malignancy that requires removal of all or part of
             one or both testicles. Or, have a medical condition (genetic or autoimmune) that
             results in decline in fertility e.g. Klinefelter syndrome.

          4. Or, have newly diagnosed or recurrent disease affecting fertility. Those who were not
             enrolled at the time of initial diagnosis (i.e., patients with recurrent disease) are
             eligible if they have not previously received therapy that is viewed as likely to
             result in complete and permanent loss of testicular function.

          5. Have two testicles if undergoing elective removal of a testicle for fertility
             preservation only. Note: removal of both testicles will limit fertility preservation
             options.

          6. Sign an approved informed consent and authorization permitting the release of
             personal health information. The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized
             guardian must acknowledge in writing that consent for specimen collection has been
             obtained, in accordance with institutional policies approved by the U.S. Department
             of Health and Human Services.

          7. Consent for serum screening tests for infectious diseases to be performed at the time
             of testicular tissue harvesting. The immediate testing will include but not be
             limited to testing for Hepatitis B and C and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          8. Undergo a full history and physical examination and obtain standard pre-operative
             clearance (based on the most recent guideline for Perioperative Cardiovascular
             Evaluation for Noncardiac Surgery) as determined by their primary surgeon.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed with psychological, psychiatric, or other conditions which prevent giving
             fully informed consent.

          2. Diagnosed with an underlying medical condition that significantly increases their
             risk of complications from anesthesia and surgery.

          3. Previously recipients of gonadotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy thought to
             have resulted in impairment of testicular function.
