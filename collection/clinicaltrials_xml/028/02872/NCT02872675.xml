  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to explore the role of prebiotic supplementation in adults with and
      without Asthma/Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (A/EIB). All participants will be asked
      to consume a prebiotic supplement, and a placebo, each for a total duration of four weeks,
      separated by a four-week wash out period. The investigators hypothesise that improvements in
      pulmonary function observed following prebiotic supplementation will be attributed to gut
      microbiota mediated improvements in host immune function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will investigate the effects of a prebiotic based nutritional intervention
      on airway inflammation/bronchoconstriction in adults diagnosed with Asthma/Exercise-Induced
      Bronchoconstriction (A/EIB). Previous research conducted in adults diagnosed with A/EIB has
      reported significant improvements in pulmonary function following three weeks of prebiotic
      supplementation. The significant improvements in pulmonary function were attributed to an
      attenuation of various markers of airway inflammation, potentially regulated by gut
      microbiota mediated improvements in systemic immune function.

      Prebiotics are a type of non-digestible carbohydrate/dietary fibre that can only be digested
      by certain beneficial bacterial species. As part prebiotic digestion, beneficial bacteria
      produce energy/metabolites that can be used to support a variety of human immune functions,
      such as reducing the level of airway inflammation that occurs following exposure to relevant
      triggers (e.g. exercise).

      Imbalances and/or deficiencies in gut bacterial composition have been identified in adults
      diagnosed with long-term allergic asthma. However, the potential mechanisms behind how
      manipulating gut bacterial composition may lead to reductions in the severity of A/EIB have
      yet to be investigated.

      Participants with and without A/EIB will be allocated two separate nutritional supplements
      following a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. During the first phase of
      the nutritional intervention, participants will consume the first supplement (either
      prebiotic, or placebo), for a total duration of four weeks. A four-week wash out period will
      then be completed before the remaining nutritional supplement is administered for an equal
      duration.

      Analyses of gut bacterial composition, and key bacterial metabolite production, will be
      carried out alongside assessments of immune and pulmonary function at baseline, and
      throughout all phases of the nutritional intervention. As a result, data will be obtained
      that will enable the role of the gut microbiota in mediating improvements in immune function
      to be explored. Current understandings of the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis
      of A/EIB will be expanded through the investigation of novel pathophysiological mechanisms,
      helping to inform future treatment prospects.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be administered a prebiotic (galactooligosaccharide) supplement (HOST-DM059), and a taste/appearance matched placebo (Maltodextrin) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.
The nutritional intervention will be completed over a twelve week period, consisting of two, four-week supplementation phases separated by a four-week wash out period. Participants will be randomly allocated one of the nutritional supplements during phase one (labelled as either 'L', or 'X'), and asked to consume one powdered sachet every morning (3.8g). Participants will then complete a four week wash out period, before being assigned the remaining nutritional supplement during phase two. Sachets can be reconstituted in tea/coffee/fruit juice, or sprinkled over cereal etc.</intervention_model_description>

Upon trial completion (e.g. the final visit of the final participant), the chief investigator will contact HOST Therabiomics to obtain information on the supplement blinding protocol. Should any participants, care providers, investigators, or outcome assessors become aware of the blinding protocol during the trial they will be informed not to disclose this information to any other relevant personnel.</masking_description>

    <description>HOST-DM059 is the only Second Generation Prebiotic, manufactured by Clasado Biosciences/HOST Therabiomics. HOST-DM059 consists of a specific type of carbohydrate/dietary fibre (GOS), and an enzyme extracted from specific species of Bifidobacteria (e.g. The β-Galacotosidase Enzyme, &amp; Bifidobacterium Bifidum). The enzyme from which HOST-DM059 provides a highly selective energy source for certain species of Bifidobacteria. HOST-DM059 encourages the growth and development of Bifidobacteria. Certain species of Bifidobacteria have been demonstrated to exert prominent immunomodulatory effects in terms of regulating systemic inflammation.</description>
