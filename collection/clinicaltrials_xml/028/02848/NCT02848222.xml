  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate the benefits of using the Bruder Moist
      Heat Compress in contact lens wearers who report reduced comfortable wear time. This will be
      done by assessing for improvement in ocular oil gland function and comfortable contact lens
      wearing time after one month of daily warm compress application. The efficacy of the Bruder
      Moist Heat Compress applied once will be compared to twice daily application as well as
      compared to warm compress application using a wash cloth.
