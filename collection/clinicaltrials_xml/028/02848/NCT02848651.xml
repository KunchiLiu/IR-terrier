  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, prospective, multicenter study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of single-agent atezolizumab in participants with treatment-naive
      locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. In addition, the primary biomarker objective is to
      evaluate various predictive cutoffs for novel blood-based diagnostic assays.
