    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using e-cigarettes (ECIG) rather than regular
      tobacco cigarettes alters lung inflammation in people with HIV. The study is also interested
      in asking subjects their opinion on the use of ECIG and how they make them feel. This study
      is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat asthma or HIV or to modify
      tobacco use.

      Title: Effects of e-cigarettes (ECIGs) on pulmonary inflammation and behavior in HIV
      infected smokers

      Purpose of the Study: Even though smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and
      deaths in the U.S., millions of Americans continue to smoke cigarettes, including 40-70% of
      all HIV-infected patients. The advent of e-cigarettes as a potential risk reduction strategy
      to reduce traditional tobacco cigarette use and promote smoking cessation is attractive. The
      goal of the proposed research is to gain an understanding of the cellular and inflammatory
      mechanisms that occur in the lung of HIV-infected smokers who transition from conventional
      tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes and to characterize the effects of substituting
      e-cigarettes on withdrawal, craving and neurocognition. These efforts will provide first in
      kind data on the effects of ECIGs in this study population.

      Background &amp; Significance: While rates of cigarette smoking are gradually decreasing in the
      US, the burden of tobacco abuse among people living with HIV remains undisputedly high with
      prevalence estimates two to three times higher than the general population (42.4% vs.
      17.8%). Although ECIGs likely contain significantly fewer numbers of toxicants compared to
      combustible cigarettes, it is unclear whether ECIG are less harmful than their traditional
      tobacco counterparts or if they can reduce withdrawal, craving and neurocognitive deficits
      that precipitate relapse to conventional cigarettes. The biological effects of ECIG on lung
      health have not yet been sufficiently characterized due the relatively nascent nature of the
      field. While combustible tobacco use induces oxidant stress in the airways of healthy
      smokers, little work to date has established the effect of ECIG use on oxidant stress in
      human airways. Transitioning the HIV-infected smoker from combustible tobacco to ECIG may
      decrease lung oxidative stress, improve lung function and decrease withdrawal symptoms and
      deficits in neurocognition commonly seen with tobacco withdrawal.

      Design &amp; Procedures: HIV-infected persons will be recruited from the Duke Infectious
      Diseases Clinic. For this pilot study, 15 willing subjects will receive ECIGs and 5 control
      subjects will continue to smoke their chosen usual brand of combustible cigarettes (UB).
      Each group will receive either ECIG or UB for a total of 4 weeks and undergo pulmonary and
      behavioral assessments during this period. In order to facilitate participants' successful
      transition to ECIG, a mobile contingency management (mCM) procedure (discussed below) will
      be used to provide monetary reinforcement for biochemically verified abstinence from
      combustible cigarettes. Participants in the UB group will also undergo mCM procedures, but
      contingencies will differ. After 4 weeks, the ECIG group will be allowed to transition back
      to their chosen combustible cigarette product for an additional 2 weeks with additional
      pulmonary and behavioral assessments. All subjects will undergo three respiratory
      assessments in the Duke Clinical Research Unit (DCRU). The first respiratory assessment will
      occur at study visit 1 (V1) to establish baseline measures of lung function, oxidative
      stress, and systemic inflammation. Pulmonary assessments will be repeated again 4wks after
      transition to ECIG or continued UB use (V4). A final respiratory assessment (V5) will occur
      2 weeks after stopping ECIG or after 6 weeks of continued UB use to measure changes relative
      to baseline lung function, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Neuro-cognitive and
      behavioral visits will occur at respiratory visits as well as 2 weeks after ECIG transition
      / continued UB use (V3).

    <description>mCM procedures are a novel smoking cessation tool previously used in the field by our colleagues in the Beckham research group. This equipment is part of a procedure called &quot;mobile contingency management&quot; or &quot;mCM&quot;. The participant will use a study smartphone to record his/her CO levels and moods at random times of the day and to verify his/her cigarette usage. The mCM program will reward the participant for each CO level and data transmitted to the study team. The study team will provide detailed information and training to allow them to participate in this part of the study.</description>
