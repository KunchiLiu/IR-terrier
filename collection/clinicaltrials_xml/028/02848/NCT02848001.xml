      Study CC-90009-AML-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation and expansion,
      first-in-human clinical study of CC-90009 in subjects with relapsed or refractory acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML).

      The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of CC-90009, The expansion part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of CC-90009 administered at or below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in
      selected expansion cohorts of in order to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age, at the time of signing the ICD (Informed Consent
             Document).

          2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICD prior to any study-related
             assessments/procedures being conducted.

          3. Relapsed or refractory AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) as defined by World Health
             Organization criteria who are not suitable for other established therapies.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 2.

          5. At least 4 weeks (from first dose) has elapsed from donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)
             without conditioning.

          6. Subjects must have the following screening laboratory values:

               -  Total White Blood Cell count (WBC) &lt; 25 x 109/L prior to first infusion. Prior
                  or concurrent treatment with hydroxyurea to achieve this level is allowed.

               -  Selected electrolytes within normal limits or correctable with supplements.

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal).

               -  Estimated serum creatinine clearance of ≥ 60 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault
                  equation.

          7. Agree to follow the CC-90009 Pregnancy Prevention Plan (PPP)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)

          2. Subjects with clinical symptoms suggesting active central nervous system (CNS)
             leukemia or known CNS leukemia. Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid is only required if
             there is clinical suspicion of CNS involvement by leukemia during screening.

          3. Patients with prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant who, in the
             investigator's judgment, have not fully recovered from the effects of the last
             transplant (e.g., transplant related side effects).

          4. Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with either standard or
             reduced intensity conditioning ≤ 6 months prior to starting CC-90009.

          5. Subjects on systemic immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT at the time of screening, or
             with clinically significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The use of topical
             steroids for ongoing skin or ocular GVHD is permitted.

          6. Prior systemic cancer-directed treatments or investigational modalities ≤ 5 half
             lives or 4 weeks prior to starting CC-90009, whichever is shorter. Hydroxyurea is
             allowed to control peripheral leukemia blasts.

          7. Leukapheresis ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting CC-90009.
