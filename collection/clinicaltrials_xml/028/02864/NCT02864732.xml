  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of applying neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation on the lumbar spine, to report how tolerable the intervention is, and
      whether the electrical stimulation improve pain, function and muscle strength.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability of electrical stimulation (NMES)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of NMES tolerability was performed by asking each subject in the stab + NMES group to describe their subjective perception of both the intensity and discomfort of the NMES current using the verbal descriptors listed in a table. The descriptors represent two distinct domains of adjectives: the sensory aspect of the perceived intensity of stimulation and the affective aspect of the perceived discomfort. Each aspect has 15 adjectives. Each subject was asked to describe the current using the descriptors listed for aspect.
This approach to measuring NMES current tolerability has been described in the literature by Delitto et al. however it has not been validated.</description>

    <description>The stabilization exercises program will consist of exercises for the lower back and abdomen. These exercises include various types of abdominal bracing and bridging and side bridging. The exercises will be performed in supine, sidelying, and quadruped. It involves activation of muscles, dissociation of lumbar spine movement from extremities movement and endurance.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Stabilization exercises plus electrical stimulation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The neuromuscular electrical stimulation is a hand-size unit that has four plastic adhesive electrical conductors known as electrodes. These electrodes are going to be placed on the skin covering the lower back muscles. They will deliver an electric current that will generate muscle contraction that resembles normal muscle contraction. This treatment will be given in addition to the stabilization exercise program.</description>
