  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how effective the study drug (tepotinib) is at stopping the growth
      and spread of lung cancer that carries a specific genetic alteration (MET exon 14 skipping
      alterations) and that did not respond to standard of care treatment such as chemotherapy
      (platinum doublet containing regimen). This study will also measure a number of other things
      including safety of the study drug and the side effects, how body processes the study drug,
      or how the study drug affects your quality of life. The study also has an optional
      pharmacogenetic research part. Pharmacogenetic research is an important way to try to
      understand the role of genetics in human disease and how genes impact the effectiveness of
      drugs, because differences in genes can change the way a person responds to a particular
      drug

    <description>Objective response will be determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and as adjudicated by an Independent review committee. Objective response is defined as either a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from first administration of trial treatment to first observation of progressive disease (PD). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30 percent (%) reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions.
