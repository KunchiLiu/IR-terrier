    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if busulfan with cyclophosphamide (when
      given with other helper drugs listed below) can help control the diseases listed above when
      given before a stem cell transplant. The safety of these study drug combinations will also
      be studied.

      Study Groups:

      Participant will be assigned to 1 of 2 study groups, depending on what type of stem cells
      they will receive.

        -  Group 1 will receive stem cells from a haploidentical donor (a donor that is a half
           match of participant's).

        -  Group 2 will receive stem cells from a matched donor (a donor that is a full match).

      If participant is in Group 1 they will receive busulfan, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine,
      tacrolimus, thiotepa, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

      If participant is in Group 2, they will receive busulfan, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and
      tacrolimus.

      Central Venous Catheter:

      The chemotherapy participant receives, some of the other drugs in this study, and the stem
      cell transplant will be given by vein through a central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a
      sterile flexible tube and needle that will be placed into a large vein while participant is
      are under local anesthesia. Some blood samples will also be drawn through participant's CVC.
      The CVC will remain in participant's body during treatment. Participant's doctor will
      explain this procedure to participant in more detail, and they will be required to sign a
      separate consent form.

      Study Drug Administration:

      For a stem cell transplant, the days before participant receives their stem cells are called
      minus days. The day participant receives the stem cells is called Day 0. The days after
      participant receives the stem cells are called plus days.

      Group 1 only:

      Participant will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on 2 separate days as either an
      outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient in the hospital.

      If participant receives busulfan as an outpatient, they will receive busulfan by vein over
      about 3 hours on Days -13 and -12. Participant will be admitted to the hospital on Day -8
      and will receive fluids by vein as part of their standard care.

      If participant receives busulfan as an inpatient, they will be admitted to the hospital on
      Day -14 and will receive fluids by vein as part of their standard care. Participant will
      receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on Days -13 and -12. Participant will rest on
      Days -11 through -8.

      On Day -7, participant will receive thiotepa by vein over 4 hours.

      Starting on Day +5, participant will receive MMF as a tablet by mouth 3 times a day for 90
      days or longer, if the doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest.

      Group 2 only:

      Participant will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on 2 separate days as either an
      outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient in the hospital.

      If participant receives busulfan as an outpatient, they will receive busulfan by vein over
      about 3 hours on Days -13 and -12. Participant will be admitted to the hospital on Day -7
      and will receive fluids by vein as part of their standard care.

      If participant receives busulfan as an inpatient, they will be admitted to the hospital on
      Day -14 and will receive fluids by vein as part of their standard care. Participant will
      receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on Days -13 and -12. Participant will rest on
      Days -11 through -7.

      Both Groups:

      Both groups will receive:

        -  Busulfan by vein over 3 hours and fludarabine by vein over 1 hour on Days -6 through
           -3.

        -  On Day 0, participant will receive the stem cell transplant by vein.

        -  Cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours on Days +3 and +4 to help lower the risk of
           graft-versus-host disease (GVHD -- when transplanted immune tissue, such as stem cells,
           attacks the tissues of the recipient's body).

        -  Starting on Day +5, participant will receive tacrolimus nonstop by vein until they are
           able to take it by mouth to help lower the risk of GVHD. Participant will then take
           tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day for about 3 months. After that, participant's
           tacrolimus dose may be lowered if they do not have GVHD. Participant's doctor will
           discuss this with them.

        -  Starting 1 week after participant's stem cell transplant, they will receive filgrastim
           as an injection under the skin 1 time a day until their blood cell levels return to
           normal. Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth of white blood cells and is part
           of participant's standard care.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) Testing:

      About 11 samples of blood (about 1-2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing at
      time points before and after participant receives their first dose of busulfan. The study
      staff will tell participant the blood testing schedule. PK testing measures the amount of
      study drug in the body at different time points and will help the doctor decide
      participant's dose of busulfan for Days -6 through -3. If the doctor thinks it is needed, PK
      blood testing may also be done on Day -6 during participant's dose of busulfan.

      A heparin lock line will be placed in participant's vein to lower the number of needle
      sticks needed for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for
      technical reasons, participant will be taken off study. The study doctor will discuss this
      with participant.

      Length of Study:

      Participant will be on study for up to 3 years after the transplant. Participant may be
      taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if they have any intolerable side effects,
      of if they are unable to follow study directions.

      Participant should talk to the study doctor if they want to leave the study early. If
      participant is taken off study early, they still may need to return for routine follow-up
      visits after the transplant, if their doctor thinks it is needed.

      It may be life-threatening to leave the study after participant has begun to receive the
      study drugs but before they receive the stem cells.

      Study Tests:

      As part of standard care, participant will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after
      the transplant. While participant is in the hospital, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be
      drawn every day to check for side effects, for routine tests, to check participant's blood
      counts, to check their kidney and liver function, and to check for infections.

      After participant is sent home from the hospital, they must remain in the Houston area to be
      checked for infections and other transplant side effects until about 3 months after
      transplant. During this time, participant will return to the clinic at least 1 time each
      week. At each visit, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      About 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam and they will be checked for symptoms of GVHD.

        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn to see how participant's body has reacted to
           the transplant.

        -  If participant's doctor thinks it is needed, they will have a bone marrow aspiration to
           check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspiration, an area of the
           hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is
           withdrawn through a large needle.

      This is an investigational study. Busulfan, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, filgrastim, MMF,
      tacrolimus, and thiotepa are FDA approved and commercially available. It is investigational
      to give cyclophosphamide in combination with busulfan and fludarabine with a stem cell
      transplant.

      Up to 100 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
