  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pedicular screwing has become the gold standard for intervertebral fixation required in
      degenerative, scoliotic, tumoral pathologies or for fractures. Several pedicular screwing
      methods exist.

      The free hand pedicular screwing requires a high learning curve and has, as a consequence, a
      high malposition rate.

      The placing of pedicular screws under fluoroscopic control is the most common technique as
      it is both reproducible and accessible. It is a two dimensional imaging technique. The
      profile incidence at the level of the spine is mostly used to spot the vertebral pedicle and
      the direction of the screw in the sagittal plane. However, there is no real control of the
      direction of the pedicular screw in the horizontal or frontal plane. The screw malposition
      rate is less important than with the 'free hand' technique but remains none of the less
      significant. Furthermore, fluoroscopy is an irradiating imaging technique, both for the
      patient and the staff.

      New revolutionary techniques as the tridimensional navigation and the per-operatory
      tomodensitometry appeared in the last few years. The techniques give the best results when
      used concommitantly. The material has the advantage of being very precise. The pedicular
      screw malposition rate is minimal after a three-dimensional localisation. However, those
      systems require qualified staff and expose the patient and the nursing team to high
      radiation levels. The costs are higher and the surgery duration is globally longer. It is
      thus difficult to implement this technique in each belgian hospital.

      Finally, the Pediguard technique appeared on the market. It is a guide for the perforation
      of the pedicular channel, with a probe at its extremity. This probe allows a real time
      measurement of the electric conductivity of the tissues that are being crossed. The
      conductivity measure is translated in a sound signal. Because the cortical bone has a low
      conductivity, the probe will emit a low intensity sound signal. The cancellous bone has a
      medium conductivity. Therefore, the probe will emit a medium sound signal. However, in the
      event of a breach in the pedicular cortical, as blood and periost have a high
      conductibility, the probe will emit a intense, rapid pace, sound signal.The Pediguard
      technique helps thus to anticipate a cortical effraction, by detecting the proximity of the
      cortical wall. It is efficient but remains relatively expensive.

      The main objective of this study is to determine the precision of the placing of pedicular
      screws, with and without Pediguard system, under fluoroscopy.
