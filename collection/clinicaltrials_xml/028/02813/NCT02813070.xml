    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, multicenter study to assess the extent and patterns of [18F]flutemetamol
      uptake in the brains of 3 groups of Japanese subjects: HV, aMCI, and pAD, and to assess the
      reproducibility of brain uptake and of image interpretation. Subjects underwent open-label
      intravenous (i.v.) administration of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection and PET imaging of the
      brain. Blinded visual image reads were performed by 10 independent board-certified readers
      (5 Japanese and 5 non-Japanese) with nuclear medicine image interpretation experience. The
      blinded visual assessments were compared with the subject's clinical diagnoses, and the
      agreement between the image interpretations made by the 2 groups of readers (Japanese and
      non-Japanese) was determined.

      This was a Phase 2, multicenter study to assess the extent and patterns of [18F]flutemetamol
      uptake in the brains of 3 groups of Japanese subjects: HV, aMCI, and pAD, and to assess the
      reproducibility of brain uptake and of image interpretation. The 3 comparison groups (HV,
      aMCI, and pAD) were defined by the subjects' main clinical diagnoses at study entry.
      Subjects underwent diagnostic quality anatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
      followed by open-label intravenous (i.v.) administration of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection and
      PET imaging of the brain. Blinded visual image reads were performed by 10 independent
      board-certified readers (5 Japanese and 5 non-Japanese) with nuclear medicine image
      interpretation experience. The blinded visual assessments were compared with the subject's
      clinical diagnoses, and the agreement between the image interpretations made by the 2 groups
      of readers (Japanese and non-Japanese) was determined. Blinded visual assessments were also
      compared to quantitative image assessments (SUVRs). Inter-reader and intra-reader agreement
      was also assessed. Test-retest variability was evaluated following a second administration
      of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection given to a subset (N = 5) of pAD subjects between 1 and 4
      weeks after their first administration of Flutemetamol F 18 Injection.
