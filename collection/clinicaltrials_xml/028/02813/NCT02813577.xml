      The post approval study will enroll US female patients presenting with claudication or
      ischemic rest pain and an angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral or
      popliteal artery. Subjects are treated per Instructions For Use (IFU) with the Lutonix
      Catheter. Subjects will have a Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) and clinical follow-up through two
      (2) years.

      The Lutonix® 035 Drug Coated Balloon Percutaneous Transluminal angioplasty (PTA) Catheter
      (Lutonix® Catheter) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (P130024) for
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, after pre-dilatation, of de novo or restenotic
      lesions up to 150mm in length in native superficial femoral or popliteal arteries with
      reference vessel diameters of 4-6mm.The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of the Lutonix Catheter for treatment of stenosis or occlusion of the femoral
      and popliteal arteries in the United States (US) female population. This study will enroll
      160 female patients at a minimum of 10 US centers and a maximum of 25.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-pregnant female ≥18 years of age;

          2. Rutherford Clinical Category 2-4;

          3. Patient is willing to provide informed consent, is geographically stable, comply with
             the required follow up visits and testing schedule; Angiographic Criteria

          4. De novo or non-stented restenotic lesion(s) in native superficial femoral or
             popliteal arteries;

          5. Lesion length ≤150 mm;

             Note: Lesion location starts ≥1 cm below the common femoral bifurcation and
             terminates distally ≤2 cm below the tibial plateau AND ≥1 cm above the origin of the
             tibial-peroneal trunk:

          6. Lesion ≥70% stenosis by visual estimate;

          7. Target reference vessel diameter of 4-6mm

          8. Lesion(s) is located at least 3cm from any stent, if target vessel was previously
             stented; Note: Successful inflow artery treatment is defined as attainment of
             residual diameter stenosis ≤30% without death or major vascular complication.

        10. At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle, free from significant (≥50%)
        stenosis as confirmed by angiography that has not previously been revascularized
        (treatment of outflow disease is NOT permitted during the index procedure); 11. Successful
        antegrade wire crossing and pre-dilatation of the target lesion; Note: Successful
        pre-dilatation defined by residual stenosis ≤30% Lesion is not appropriate for stenting
        due to proximity to the knee joint. 12. No other prior vascular interventions within 2
        weeks before and/or planned 30 days after the protocol treatment except for remote common
        femoral patch angioplasty separated by at least 2 cm from the lesion(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Life expectancy of &lt;1 years

          2. Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study or
             previously enrolled in this study; Note: Enrollment in another investigational drug
             or device study during the follow up period is not allowed

          3. History of stroke within 3 months;

          4. History of Myocardial Infarction (MI), thrombolysis or angina within 2 weeks of index
             procedure;

          5. Renal failure or chronic kidney disease with serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/L within 30
             days of index procedure or treated with dialysis;

          6. Sudden symptom onset, acute vessel occlusion, or acute or sub-acute thrombus in
             target vessel;

          7. Use of adjunctive primary treatment modalities (i.e. laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty,
             cutting balloon, etc.)
