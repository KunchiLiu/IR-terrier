          4. HIV-negative as determined by the HIV algorithm applied at Screening/Pre- Enrolment

          5. Willing to refrain from participation in another research trial using drugs,
             vaccines, medical devices and microbicides for the duration of the IPM 032 trial

          6. Willing to provide adequate locator information for trial retention purposes and be
             reachable per local standard procedures (e.g., by home visit or telephone; or via

             taking part in the IPM 027 trial

          2. Participant self-report of taking post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) within â‰¤ 2 months
             at Screening Visit Note: Participants may be enrolled after completing the PEP
