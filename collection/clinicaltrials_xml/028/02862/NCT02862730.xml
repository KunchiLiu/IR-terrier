  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop systems are an emerging technology that automate hormone delivery. They are
      quickly paving the way to revolutionize the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Several categories
      have emerged: dual-hormone (insulin and glucagon) closed-loop systems and closed-loop
      systems with insulin only, one variety of which is the low glucose suspend safety feature
      now available from Medtronic (MiniMed 530G with Enlite). The study described within this
      protocol is designed to test the efficacy of a new closed-loop algorithm for managing blood
      glucose in people with type 1 diabetes before and after exercise. The new algorithm will
      have 3 modes: a single hormone insulin only mode, a dual-hormone insulin and glucagon mode
      and an insulin only mode with predictive low glucose suspend, all with an exercise detection
      algorithm. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a dual hormone AP with an
      exercise detection algorithm outperforms both single hormone AP and a low glucose suspend
      algorithm and current care using the subject's own insulin pump.

      Subjects will undergo four approximately 84 hour studies. The first day of each study will
      be an approximately 12 hour inpatient visit to include activities of daily living and an
      exercise period with 2 days spent as an outpatient. The subject will come back to the
      research center on the fourth day to complete another approximately 12 hour inpatient visit
      to include activities of daily living and an exercise period followed by removal of all
      devices. In randomized order, subjects will have glucose controlled using the following
      systems: 1) dual-hormone closed-loop system, 2) insulin only closed-loop system, 3)
      predictive low glucose suspend system and 4) current care with subject using their own
      insulin and insulin pump. Both of the closed-loop system algorithms have an exercise
      detection algorithm that uses inputs from a heart rate monitor and accelerometer, the
      Zephyrlife BioPatch. After exercise detection, insulin is turned off for the first 30
      minutes, the total insulin infusion rate is adjusted by an exercise multiplier, and for the
      dual-hormone system, the target glucose for glucagon is increased along with the maximum
      dose of glucagon allowed. The predictive low glucose suspend system will utilize the
      patient's optimized basal rates, correction factor, and carb ratio. The patient will bolus
      for meals and hyperglycemia as usual under PLGS, but will have the additional safety net of
      the pump suspending insulin when it predicts a hypoglycemic event. The Dexcom CGM system and
      the Tandem t:slim pumps will be used for all three intervention visits.

      Subjects will arrive at the CTRC at 7am at the start of intervention visits. Subjects will
      eat breakfast, lunch and dinner in the research center. Subjects will eat breakfast at
      8:30am. After breakfast, subjects will complete activities of daily living (sitting on a
      chair, lying on a bed, washing dishes, sweeping the floor, etc.). Subjects will eat lunch at
      12pm. Subjects will exercise for 45 minutes on a treadmill around 2pm. Subjects will eat
      dinner at 6pm and be discharged. The subject will then go home for Day 2 and Day 3 and
      return on Day 4 to complete another 12 hour inpatient visit with the schedule of activities
      identical to Day 1.
