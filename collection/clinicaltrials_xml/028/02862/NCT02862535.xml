      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of
      andecaliximab as monotherapy and in combination with S-1 and cisplatin chemotherapy in
      Japanese participants with inoperable advanced or recurrent gastric or recurrent
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.

    <description>Up to 6 participants will receive andecaliximab 800 mg until disease progression. If 2 or more participants experience dose limiting toxicities (DLT) within the first 28 days, up to 6 additional participants will be enrolled to receive andecaliximab 600 mg. If 2 additional DLTs occur at 600 mg, the study will be discontinued.</description>

    <description>Once all participants in the monotherapy cohort have completed the 28-day DLT assessment, an internal safety review team will review the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data from all participants prior to proceeding with the combination therapy cohort to evaluate andecaliximab with standard of care treatment. Up to 6 participants will receive andecaliximab in combination with S-1 and cisplatin chemotherapy.</description>
