  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have an existing exercise program (N&gt;70) with a unique population of
      individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) who have been enrolled in FES-RT for at least 6
      months. Roughly half have high level SCI. Thirty individuals with high level SCI who have
      FES-row trained for at least 6 months will be randomized to (continued) FES-RT for 4 months
      with either NIV or sham NIV. Before and after training, the investigators will assess
      maximal aerobic capacity, ventilation, cardiac output, and arterio-venous oxygen difference.
      Based on the investigators current data, it is hypothesized that only those randomized to
      NIV will experience further increases in aerobic capacity and that these increases will
      relate to increases in cardiac output and arterio-venous oxygen difference. This
      Exploratory/Developmental Research project will lay the groundwork for a larger study of the
      impact of FES-RT+NIV to improve health and function in those with high level SCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular aerobic exercise with sufficient intensity can improve overall health, however daily
      energy expenditure is low in those with SCI, especially in those with high level lesions. We
      have developed Functional Electrical Stimulation Row Training (FESRT) that couples
      volitional arm and electrically controlled leg exercise, increasing the active muscle and
      resulting in benefits of large muscle mass exercise. Despite the potential for enhancing
      aerobic capacity, those with high level lesions (C4 to T2) have a remaining obstacle to
      attaining higher work capacities they have the greatest pulmonary muscle denervation and our
      preliminary work suggests this limits the aerobic capacity that can be achieved with FESRT.
      External ventilatory support could improve the ability to exercise train and hence enhance
      the adaptations to chronic exercise in high level SCI. Non invasive ventilation (NIV) during
      exercise training has been shown to improve gains in exercise capacity in those with
      similarly restrictive breathing. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that the use of
      NIV during FESRT will reduce ventilatory limits to exercise, leading to increased aerobic
      capacity in high level SCI. Our aims are to determine the magnitude of improvement in
      aerobic capacity and its relationship to increases in maximal cardiac output and arterio
      venous oxygen difference after 4 months of FESRT+NIV compared to FESRT+shamNIV. The
      investigators have access to a large (N&gt;70) and unique population of individuals with SCI
      who have been enrolled in FESRT for at least 6 months. Roughly half have SCI between C4 and
      T2. 30 individuals with high level SCI who have FES row trained for at least 6 months will
      be randomized to (continued) FESRT for 4 months with either NIV or sham NIV. Before and
      after training, the investigators will assess maximal aerobic capacity, ventilation, cardiac
      output, and arterio venous oxygen difference. Based on our current data, it is hypothesized
      that only those randomized to NIV will experience further increases in aerobic capacity and
      that these increases will relate to increased cardiac output and arterio venous oxygen
      difference. This Exploratory/Developmental Research project will determine feasibility and
      effectiveness of this approach to exercise and will lay the groundwork for a larger,
      controlled trial.
