      N-acetylcysteine in the treatment of depressive symptoms in youth at high-risk for bipolar
      disorder: a functional connectivity study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct an 8-week, open label study of N-acetylcysteine for the treatment of depressive
      symptoms in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder, with resting state functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) examinations at baseline and endpoint. This proposal is innovative
      because it investigates the efficacy and tolerability of a novel pharmacological treatment
      in youth offspring of bipolar disorder, and examines the neurophysiology of predictors of
      mood disorders in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder. This study will obtain pilot data
      to propose a larger, neuroimaging-based, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
      N-acetylcysteine in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder. The expected outcome, that
      N-acetylcysteine will be efficacious in ameliorating depressive symptoms in youth at high
      risk for bipolar disorder, and that it will demonstrate improvement in functional
      connectivity within the left frontostriatal circuit associated with treatment response.

    <description>N-acetylcysteine will be initiated at 600 mg PO daily for week 1, then increased to 600 mg PO twice a day for Week 2, then increased to 600 mg PO morning and 900 mg PO evening for Week 3, then increased to 1200 mg PO twice a day for Week 4-8. Doses might be decreased anytime if clinically indicated. Following the study, all patients will be referred to treatment as usual. Adherence will be assessed in weekly visits in the first month and then bi-weekly in the second month. Adherence will be assessed by subject interview, pill counts during each study visit, and by legal guardian interview (if minor).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 15 years, 0 mos. - 24 years, 11 mos.;

          -  For minor, at least one parent or step-parent/guardian with whom the subject lives is
             willing to participate in research sessions;

          -  For minor, the child and relative(s) are able and willing to give written informed
             assent/consent to participate, respectively;

          -  the youth meets criteria for high-risk:

               -  has at least one first degree relative with Bipolar I Disorder, as assessed by
                  the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
                  Mental Disorders - DSM (SCID);

               -  the youth shows evidence of current significant depressive symptoms as
                  determined by a current Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) greater or
                  equal than 8.

        Inclusion of Youth with Depressive or Anxiety Disorders and Comorbid Disorders Although
        not formally required for study entry, many youth will meet criteria for a range of mood
        and anxiety disorders at study entry (except for major depressive disorder, bipolar I or
        II disorder, and psychotic disorders, which are exclusionary), which will formally be
        assessed with a structured diagnostic interview at baseline. If during the course of
        interviewing it becomes apparent that participants demonstrate symptomatology and/or
        rating scale scores consistent with a psychiatric disorder, youth and their families will
        be debriefed about these findings and a plan will be developed in collaboration with the
        patient's clinician on alternatives to study participation for the treatment of their
        disorder if indicated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of current or lifetime history of mood episodes (major depressive episodes,
             mixed, manic, hypomanic), or psychotic disorders.

          -  a DSM-5 diagnosis of autism, pervasive developmental disorder,obsessive-compulsive
             disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, Tourette's disorder, or any psychotic
             disorder including schizophrenia;

          -  Drug or alcohol abuse or dependence disorders in the 3 months prior to study
             recruitment, although a lifetime history of substance or alcohol disorders can be
             present if the child has been abstinent for at least 3 months (see further discussion
             below);

          -  Pregnancy; participants will be encouraged but not mandated to discuss a positive
             pregnancy test with their guardians (if minors) and we will follow local laws

          -  History of major neurological disorders (such as epilepsy), or head trauma with &gt; 10
             minutes loss of consciousness

          -  Evidence of mental retardation (IQ less than 70), as determined by the Wechsler
             Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence

          -  any contraindication for MRI, including metal in the body related to an injury or
             surgery (e.g., surgical clips, metal fragments in the eyes), piercings that cannot be
             removed, braces, or permanent retainers.

          -  History of allergic reaction to N-acetylcysteine

          -  History of prior exposure to antidepressants or antipsychotics
