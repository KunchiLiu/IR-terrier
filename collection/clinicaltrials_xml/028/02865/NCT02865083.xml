    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the Traxi Pannus retractor in
      obese patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) who undergo Cesarean sections compared to routine pannus
      retraction techniques. Patients will be randomized to the use of the Traxi retractor during
      Cesarean section (treatment group) or the use of traditional pannus retraction techniques
      (control group). The primary outcome to be followed is surgical site disruption. The
      investigators will also assess the duration of surgery or length of time from skin incision
      to delivery of the infant, change in hemoglobin, estimated blood loss, postoperative length
      of stay, need for hospital readmission or emergency room visits, or other complication rates
      between the two groups.

      Surgical site infections (SSI) are an important cause of morbidity following cesarean
      sections. The rate of surgical site infections following cesarean section in the United
      States is estimated between 3-15%, depending on the population studied, definitions of
      surgical site infection used, and length of time studied and is often underestimated.
      Morbidities include longer length of hospital stay, hospital readmission, wound opening and
      re-exploration, need for home health care, increased health care costs and loss of
      productivity. The risk of developing a SSI after a Cesarean section is increased with
      certain patient characteristics, such as obesity and duration of surgery and is decreased
      with the use prophylactic antibiotics prior to the skin incision.

      Obesity is a significant public health problem and the incidence continues to increase in
      the United States. It has been shown to be associated with increased risk of SSI after
      cesarean section in several studies. Olsen et al reviewed 1,605 patients who underwent
      cesarean section and found increased BMI at admission was an independent risk factor for
      SSI. In another study of 19,416 women in Israel who had cesarean deliveries, women who had a
      BMI ≥30 kg/m2 had an increased risk for infection (odds ratio [OR} =2.2; 95% Confidence
      Interval [CI]. Leth, et al. also found obesity as a risk factor associated with wound
      infection. In this study of 2,492 consecutive women who had cesarean sections in Denmark,
      infection rates increased with increasing BMI, with women with a BMI kg/m2 30.0-34.9 having
      an infection rate of 19.1% and women with a BMI of 35.0-39.9 kg/m2 and of ≥40 kg/m2 both
      having infection rates of 31.1%. Hypotheses for the increased rate of wound infections in
      obese patients include decreased vascularity of adipose tissue, increase in wound area, and
      poorer penetration of prophylactic antibiotics to adipose tissue. Adequate surgical exposure
      and good visualization are paramount in abdominal surgery. Retraction of the pannus cephalad
      is often required for adequate visualization and access to the lower abdomen and thus the
      lower uterine segment. Several studies have been shown that pfannensteil or joel-cohen
      incisions are superior to vertical incisions due to increased risk of classical cesarean
      delivery in the case of the obese gravida. Limited studies have been completed to assess
      supra umbilical incisions.

      Other methods of pannus retraction are currently utilized in obstetrics surgery, mostly with
      surgical tape or Montgomery straps. However, there are currently no clinical trials
      comparing types of pannus retractors. Potential benefits from the Traxi retractor are
      decreased operating time, decreased need for additional operating room personnel, and
      increased ease of delivery of neonate. In addition, the Traxi is designed to stay on for 24
      hours in order to elevate the pannus, this will decrease exposure to moisture and possibly
      other bacteria as the skin begins to heal.

    <description>To determine if there is a difference in wound disruption rates, in obese patients who have Cesarean sections when the Traxi retractor is used during Cesarean sections, when compared to traditional pannus retractor techniques, montogmery straps. Secondary outcomes will include the duration of surgery or length of time from skin incision to delivery of the infant, change in hemoglobin, estimated blood loss, postoperative length of stay, need for hospital readmission or emergency room visits, or other complication rate between the two groups.</description>
