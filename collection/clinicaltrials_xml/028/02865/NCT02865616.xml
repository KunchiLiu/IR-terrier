  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To measure the resolution of diarrhea as well as the feasibility of administration and
      safety of MET-1 for the treatment of recurrent CDI in patients who have experienced at least
      two prior episodes of CDI and have developed recurrence after having completed standard-of
      care oral antibiotic therapy to treat CDI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint is clinical resolution of diarrhea with no CDI relapse at 30 days
      following the last dose of MET-1, i.e., absence of recurrence of diarrheal symptoms (see
      definitions section) with laboratory-confirmed evidence of C. difficile after 30 days.

      The secondary endpoints are: i) safety and tolerability, including adverse events of grade 2
      or above; ii) overall well-being including number of bowel movements and energy level, etc
      as based on standardized IBS questionnaire (see appendix); iii) presence of MET-1 bacteria
      in stool at 30 days, based on DNA sequencing; iv) mortality, at end of followup period -
      mortality attributable to CDI will also be determined, by performing a detailed clinical
      chart review on any patient who expires during the followup period.

      Open label, single center pilot study of 20 patients. Patients who have met the inclusion
      criteria will be given up to four doses administered within 12 days ± 5 days; the first two
      doses will be given by colonoscopy, and the third and fourth dose via enema only for
      patients that continue to have symptoms post treatment. Patients will be on vancomycin to
      control symptoms up until the time of the treatment. Patient must hold their po vancomycin
      for 24-48 hours prior to receiving the first dose. Patients will be followed up for 6 months
      post-treatment.
