  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HALACAP-1406 is a prospective single-centre non-interventional study assessing the
      refrigerant helmet use as medical device to prevent alopecia induced by eribulin (Halaven®)
      in the conditions of use specified in its marketing authorization. Eribulin will be used
      alone for the treatment of the patients having a locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer which have progressed after at least 1 chemotherapy regimen for their advanced stage.

    <textblock>
      A nurse will meet the patient and present the study, then the patient will be invited to
      participate. If the patient is interested, an information note will be given and the
      non-opposition of the patient will be collected.

      Patients will be registered via a registration form and an inclusion number will be
      attributed at each patient.

      Eribulin will be used within the framework of its marketing authorization, per cycle of 21
      days, at day 1 and day 8.

      Modalities of refrigerant helmet use will be set according to the habits of the Oscar
      Lambret center with the following rules :

        -  Placement of a single-use non-woven hygiene cap on the scalp

        -  T-15 minutes: placement of the refrigerant helmet

        -  T0: begin of eribulin infusion (duration: 2-5 minutes)

        -  T+15 minutes: rinse of the line

        -  T+30 minutes: withdrawal of the helmet

      Efficacy will be evaluated before treatment and at each eribulin cycle.
