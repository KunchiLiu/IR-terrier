      Prospective observational clinical study to verify an algorithm used to predict
      cardiopulmonary events in patients presenting to the emergency department.

      A novel algorithm for determining risk of acute cardiac complications, including cardiac
      arrest, for patients presenting to the ED has recently been reported. Unlike prior risk
      stratification tools that relied on basic vital sign data, this algorithm utilizes advanced
      computing of ECG data to solve the risk classification problem. Data will be collected on
      patients presenting to the emergency department with a primary complaint that is determined
      to be cardiopulmonary of origin by a clinician.

      Verification of the results of the previous studies using this algorithm in a more diverse
      patient cohorts is required. As such, the proposed study will investigate the accuracy of
      the algorithm.
