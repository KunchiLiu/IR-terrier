  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a Phase II study, prospective and placebo controlled, of a topical
      cream containing sodium nitrite compared to the current standard of care. Sodium nitrite is
      a local donor of nitric oxide, which is known to improve blood flow and decrease bacterial
      load in the ulcer bed. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of topical sodium
      nitrite cream treatment in patients with sickle cell disease and chronic leg ulcers and to
      determine its effectiveness in accelerating the healing process and decreasing the pain
      associated with ulceration.

      Potential benefit will be a durable resolution or improvement of the leg ulcer and its
      associated pain. Possible side effects include decreased blood pressure and
      methemoglobinemia, secondary to sodium nitrite absorption through the ulcerated skin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic leg ulcers are a complication of many blood disorders such as sickle cell disease,
      thalassemia, and other red blood cell disorders. In these disorders, red blood cells break
      down earlier than normal, which researchers suspect may cause or contribute to the
      development of leg ulcers; however, the exact cause is unknown, and current therapies are
      not very effective. Researchers are interested in determining if a research cream made with
      sodium nitrite, a substance that is known to increase blood flow by dilating blood vessels,
      may speed up the healing of skin ulcers.

      Investigators are planning to enroll fifty patients with sickle cell disease and randomize
      them to be treated twice a week with sodium nitrite cream or a placebo for ten weeks. The
      following events will be compared in treatment and placebo arms: a) changes in blood
      pressure; b) changes in pulse oximetry; c) changes in methemoglobin levels; d) any adverse
      events; e) rate of SCD related complications; f) changes in biomarkers of inflammation and
      other laboratory data such as complete blood count and chemistries.

      In order to determine if topical sodium nitrite accelerates wound healing and decreases pain
      at the wound site compared to placebo in patients receiving similar levels of wound care,
      investigators will a) accurately measure and photograph ulcers at baseline, after a two week
      run-in period and at predefined time points during the study and compare treatment arm to
      placebo; b) pain scores at wound sites will be recorded and compared for the two groups, c)
      Investigators will calculate opioid intake in the two arms and d) quality of life measures
      before and at the end of the trial

Logistic regression models will be applied if inclusion of confounding variables deems necessary. We will also test if declines of weekly-measured absolute ulcer size on a continuous scale over the study period will be different between the two groups by applying mixed effects linear models for analysis of repeated-measure outcomes.</description>
