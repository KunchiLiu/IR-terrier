    <textblock>
      The goal of this laboratory research study is to learn more about genetic factors that may
      influence the risk for developing colorectal cancer at a young age.

      Questionnaires:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, they will fill out some questionnaires
      about their work, family history, medical history, and health habits. It should take about
      10-15 minutes to complete the questionnaires.

      Participant will complete another questionnaire about their experience as a cancer survivor.
      These questions will be about participant's quality of life, well-being, concerns they may
      have, as well as the types of health care and follow-up care they are receiving. It should
      take about 20-25 minutes to complete this questionnaire.

      All of the questionnaires will either be given to participant by the research staff at one
      of their MD Anderson visits or they will be mailed to participant's home with a postage-paid
      return envelope to mail them back to the study staff.

      Blood or Saliva Collection:

      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be collected 1 time.

      If participant is unwilling or unable to give a blood sample, a saliva sample will be
      collected instead. While participant is at MD Anderson, a saliva collection kit will be
      given to them.

      Length of Study:

      If participant is an active patient who has undergone treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center
      within the past year, they will receive additional questionnaires 6 and 12 months after they
      have completed treatment, and then every year for up to 5 years.

      If participant is a patient who has completed treatment over 1 year ago, or are a patient,
      they will also complete a questionnaire at least once every year for up to 5 years.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 1,000 patients and family members will take part in this study. All will be enrolled
      at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. MDACC patients who have adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, diagnosed between ages
             18 through 50 (young-onset), or diagnosed at age 65 or older (later-onset), who had
             microsatellite status testing (by either immunohistochemistry or PCR testing or
             germline testing or a combination thereof).

          2. Patient must have sufficient command of the English language and mental capacity to
             provide consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must NOT have known or suspected clinical diagnosis of a hereditary polyposis
             syndrome including hereditary adenomatous polyposis syndromes, hereditary
             nonadenomatous polyposis syndromes, and hereditary nonpolyposis syndromes.

          2. Patient's adenocarcinoma must NOT be microsatellite high or unstable (defined by loss
             of expression of at least one DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 by
             immunohistochemistry, and/or &gt;30% allelic shift by microsatellite PCR testing).

          3. Patient must NOT have a known germline mutation in DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1,
             MSH2, MSH6, PMS2), APC, or MYH genes.
