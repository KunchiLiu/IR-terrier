      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response, safety and reactogenicity
      after receiving combined DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine when administered as a three-dose primary
      vaccination course at 3, 4.5 and 6 months of age and as a booster dose at 18 months of age

             vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parents/LARs of the subject prior to
             performing any study specific procedure.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Born full-term.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child in care

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine

             use during the study period.

          -  Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make
             intramuscular injection unsafe.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during
             the period starting since birth. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 0.5
             mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs at any time during the study
             period

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             in the period starting 30 days before the first dose and ending 30 days after the
             last dose of vaccine administration, with the exception of hepatitis B and other
             vaccines given as part of the national immunisation schedule and as part of routine
             vaccination practice, that are allowed at any time during the study period. Seasonal
             or pandemic influenza vaccine can be given at any time during the study, and
             according to the Summary of Product Characteristics and national recommendations.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/product

          -  Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Hib
             diseases.

          -  History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Hib diseases.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  Major congenital defects.

          -  Serious chronic illness.

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or
                  ≥38.0°C for rectal route.

               -  Subjects with a minor illness without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of
                  the investigator.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned
