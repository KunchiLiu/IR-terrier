    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study in approximately 43 adults with primary
      (de novo) Glioblastoma that has recurred or progressed after failure of first-line therapy
      [according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria]. Eligible subjects will
      receive intratumoral infusion of MDNA55 administered via convection-enhanced delivery (CED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, MDNA55, is a fusion protein comprising a genetically engineered
      Interleukin-4 (IL-4) linked to a modified version of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A
      (PE). MDNA55 binds to the IL-4 receptor (IL4R), over-expressed by cancer cells and
      non-malignant immunosuppressive cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and delivers a
      potent cell-killing agent, PE. The target, IL4R, is an ideal but under-exploited target for
      the development of cancer therapeutics, as it is frequently and intensely expressed on a
      wide variety of human carcinomas. Expression levels of IL4R are low on the surface of
      healthy and normal cells, but increase several-fold on cancer cells. A majority of cancer
      biopsy and autopsy samples from adult and pediatric brain tumors, including recurrent
      glioblastoma biopsies, have been shown to over-express the IL4R. Cells that do not express
      the IL4R biomarker do not bind to MDNA55 and are, therefore, not subject to PE-mediated
      effects.

      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study in approximately 43 adults with primary
      (de novo) Glioblastoma that has recurred or progressed after failure of standard first-line
      therapy (according to RANO criteria). The study will be conducted at up to 10 clinical sites
      following institutional review board approval and completed informed consent.

      Subjects that meet the study eligibility criteria will undergo surgery associated with study
      drug administration. MDNA55 will be administered locally by convection-enhanced delivery
      (CED).

      Post-treatment follow-up assessment of safety will be performed 14 days after CED infusion.
      Thereafter, efficacy and safety assessments will be performed at 30, 60, 120, 180, 270, and
      360 days after CED infusion. Subjects who discontinue before the Day 360 visit will undergo
      all the procedures scheduled for the Day 360 visit at the time of discontinuation.

               -  prior treatment with nitrosoureas

               -  prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or Gliadel® Wafers

             astrocytoma or AA)

          3. Unable to provide archival tissue from first diagnosis of Glioblastoma

          4. Tumor in the brain stem (not including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR]
             changes), an infratentorial tumor, or multifocal satellite tumors

          5. Tumor with a clinically significant mass effect (&gt; 5 mm midline shift) while on a
             stable corticosteroid dose

          6. Subjects with tumors that are completely liquefied (&gt; 95% cyst) in which convection

          7. Tumor with geometric features that make them difficult to adequately cover the tumor
             volume with infusate by using CED catheters; these tumors include the following:

               -  tumors that appear to wrap around ventricular structures, such that the catheter
                  tips may be positioned &gt; 1.0 cm of a ventricle or such that a large angle (such
                  as an &quot;elbow&quot; or &quot;L- shape&quot;) in the tumor shape is present and convection is
                  likely to be compromised

               -  tumors in which post-surgical enhancement in T1 images in the margins around a
                  resection cavity may be confused with recurring tumor; subjects in whom this
                  enhancement exceeds 1 cm thickness are excluded

          8. Clinical symptoms that are thought by the Investigator to be caused by uncontrolled
             increased intracranial pressure, hemorrhage, or edema of the brain

          9. Significant heart disease that precludes the administration of anesthesia

         10. Known to be human immunodeficiency virus positive

         11. On-going treatment with cytotoxic therapy; no additional antineoplastic therapies are
             planned until there is evidence of tumor progression after administration of the
             study drug

         12. Concurrent or a history of any significant medical illnesses that in the
             Investigator's opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or
             would compromise the subject's ability to tolerate the study drug therapy and/or put
             the subject at additional risk or interfere with the interpretation of the results of
             this trial

         13. Known history of allergy to gadolinium contrast agents

         14. Presence of another type of malignancy within &lt; 3 years prior to the screening visit,
             except for adequately treated carcinoma in-situ of the cervix, prostate cancer not
             actively treated, and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

         15. Unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol, including the
             presence of any condition (physical, mental, or social) that is likely to affect the
             subject's returning for follow-up visits or other unspecified reasons that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, make the subject's enrollment incompatible
             with study objectives
