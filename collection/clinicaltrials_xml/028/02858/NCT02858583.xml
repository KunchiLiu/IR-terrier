      Research question In newborn infants requiring CPR, does CC superimposed by sustained
      inflation compared to 3:1 compression to ventilation ratio improves return of spontaneous
      circulation?

      Overall objective: CC superimposed by sustained inflation will improve short- and long-term
      outcomes in preterm and term newborns.

      Hypothesis to be tested Primary hypothesis: By using CC superimposed by sustained inflation
      (CC+SI) during CPR the time needed to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
      compared to the current 3:1 compression to ventilation (C:V) will be reduced in asphyxiated
      newborns.

    <description>Infants randomized into the &quot;CC+SI group&quot; will receive a SI with a PIP of 25-30 cmH2O while receiving chest compression. The SI will be delivered over a period of 45 seconds. This will be followed by PEEP of 5-8 cm water to perform an assessment of the newborn's heart rate. If heart rate is &gt;60/min continue with standard care as per local hospital policy (standard hospital practice guideline). If heart rate remains &lt;60/min continue with CC+SI for another 45sec at which time a further assessment should be performed. If heart rate remains &lt;60/min continue with CC+SI.</description>

    <intervention_name>Chest compression during sustained inflation</intervention_name>
    <description>chest compression will be delivered during sustained inflation (CC+SI). The duration of each sustain inflation is 20sec. After 20sec a pause of 1sec id done before the next sustained inflation is delivered for another 20sec. Chest compressions are given continuously. This approach is continued until return of spontaneous circulation.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All infants (term or preterm infants) requiring CC in the delivery room will be
             eligible for the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants will be excluded if they have a congenital abnormality or condition that
             might have an adverse effect on breathing or ventilation (e.g. congenital
             diaphragmatic hernia), or congenital heart disease requiring intervention in the
             neonatal period. Infants would be also excluded if their parents refused to give
             consent to this study.
