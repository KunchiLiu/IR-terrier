  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      LMB-100 is a man-made protein designed to kill cancer cells. LMB-100 targets a cancer marker
      called mesothelin. Mesothelin is found on the surface of many different tumors, including
      pancreatic cancer, but is made by a very small number of normal tissues. After binding to
      the mesothelin on tumors, LMB-100 can attack and kill cancer cells. Researchers want to see
      how well it works when given with nab-paclitaxel, which treats pancreatic cancer.

      Objectives:

      To find a safe dose of LMB-100 with a fixed standard dose of nab-paclitaxel in people with
      advanced pancreatic cancer. To see how well the combination of the two drugs reduce tumor
      size.

      Eligibility:

      Adults age 18 and older with advanced pancreatic cancer that has worsened after anti-cancer
      therapy.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will give blood,
      urine, and tissue samples. They will have scans and x-rays.

      During each 21-day cycle:

      Participants will get LMB-100 by an IV catheter on days 1, 3, and 5. This is a tube inserted
      in a vein, usually in the arm.

      Participants will get nab-paclitaxel by IV on days 1 and 8.

      They will get this combination for up to 4 cycles or until their disease worsens or they
      have intolerable side effects.

      Participants will have blood and urine tests and scans throughout the study.

      Participants will have a safety follow-up visit 6 weeks after treatment ends. If their
      disease remains stable or improves, they will be scanned every 6 weeks until their disease
      gets worse. Even if their disease gets worse, they or their doctor will be called to talk
      about their cancer status.

      Background:

        -  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the United States,
           claiming more than 40,000 lives each year.

        -  Incidence nearly equals mortality with just 6% of participants living five years beyond
           their diagnosis. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, but even patients
           with early stage disease have a long term survival of less than 20%.

        -  Mesothelin is specifically a marker of adenocarcinoma in the human disease and is not
           expressed in preceding pre-malignant stages of tumor development

        -  Expression of mesothelin in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has been examined in
           several published studies and ranges from 86 to 100%

        -  Recombinant immunotoxins (RITs) are antibody-based therapeutics that carry a toxin
           payload. RITs that target mesothelin contain a genetically engineered variant of
           Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) in which the native cell-binding domain of PE is replaced
           by the mesothelin-binding antibody fragment. SS1P was the first mesothelin-targeted RIT
           tested in patients.

        -  LMB-100 contains a newly engineered PE fragment that has improved activity against most
           pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro, and is also much less toxic than SS1P in
           preclinical models. The new PE contains modifications specifically designed to reduce
           immunogenicity of the molecule.

        -  Pre-administration of paclitaxel with SS1P was demonstrated to increase the amount of
           immunotoxin internalized by tumor cells and to reduce levels of shed mesothelin in the
           intra-tumoral environment so that more immunotoxin could bind tumor cells. The effect
           is even more pronounced with NAB-paclitaxel in a pancreatic cancer model.

        -  Initial clinical testing of LMB-100 was performed by Roche in a multi-center
           international first in human trial (NCT02317419). The agent was well tolerated and
           appeared to have decreased immunogenicity compared to SS1P based on preliminary
           results.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase I:

           --To determine the maximum tolerated dose of LMB-100 in combination nab-paclitaxel
           chemotherapy in participants with advanced pancreatic cancer

        -  Phase II:

             -  To determine the objective response rate (PR+CR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria
                of

      LMB-100 in combination with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy in participants with advanced
      pancreatic cancer

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to18 years

        -  Histologically confirmed recurrent, metastatic and/or advanced pancreatic ductal
           adenocarcinoma

        -  Treatment must include at least one prior chemotherapy regimen

        -  No nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel treatment in the last four months

        -  Adequate organ function

        -  Participants with HIV, active HBV or HCV infections are excluded

      Design:

        -  This study is a Phase I/II open label study to assess the safety and efficacy of
           LMB-100 in combination with the standard of care agent nab-paclitaxel in participants
           metastatic and/or locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

        -  Subjects will be treated for up to 4 cycles

        -  In the phase I portion of the study, up to 3 dose levels will be evaluated. LMB-100
           will be administered on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21 day cycle and nab-paclitaxel will be
           administered on days 1 and 8

        -  In the phase II portion of the study, up to 20 evaluable participants (including those
           treated at the MTD in the phase I study) will be enrolled.

        -  The phase II study will be conducted in a Simon Minimax two stage phase II design. The
           first stage will enroll 13 evaluable participants, including the six participants
           treated at the MTD from phase I. If 1 or more has a response, then accrual would
           continue until a total of 20 evaluable participants have been enrolled.

          -  Ability of participant to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Known or clinically suspected CNS 2.1.2.1 primary tumors or metastases including
             leptomeningeal metastases. History or clinical evidence of CNS metastases unless they
             have been previously treated, are asymptomatic, and have had no requirement for

             diabetes mellitus, and/or significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart
             Association Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the last 6
             months, unstable arrhythmias, unstable angina, or clinically significant pericardial
             effusion)

          -  Any known diagnoses, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition (other than
             pancreatic adenocarcinoma) that would contraindicate the use of an investigational
             drug, interfere with tumor measurement or lead to an expected life expectancy of less
