      Thirty patients will be treated: 15 with a coronally positioned tunnel technique with
      NovaDerm® xenograft using continuous sling suture to secure both the graft and the flap
      (test treatment) and 15 with a coronally positioned tunnel technique with AlloDerm®
      allograft using continuous sling suture to secure both the graft and the flap (control
      treatment). Sutures used for the control group will be Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle
      for both the test and control groups. The coronally positioned tunnel technique was
      previously described by Edwards Pat Allen (E.P. Allen, Center for Advanced Dental Education,
      Dallas, Texas; course manual). Each patient will provide at least one Miller Class I or II
      facial recession defect, ≥ 3 mm. Patients will be randomly selected by a coin toss to
      receive either the test or control treatment. Mentor will toss the coin immediately prior to
      suturing. Patients will be evaluated postoperatively for a period of 4 months. The examiner
      will be blinded and will not be aware of the patient treatment at any time during the term
      of the study. Three exams for measurements will be performed per patient on total:
      preoperative, at week eight and 16 (4 months) postoperatively.

    <description>Initial and final recession will be measured from the cementoenamel junction to the gingival margin in millimeters. Root coverage will be determined by the amount of initial recession minus the final recession. Percent root coverage will be determined by root coverage divided by initial recession, multiplied by 100.</description>
