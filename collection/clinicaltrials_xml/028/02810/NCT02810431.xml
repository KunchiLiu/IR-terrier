  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      This protocol is designed to have samples from closing protocols transferred to this
      protocol for long-term storage. The protocol is concerned with the retention of blood,
      plasma, serum, CSF, aspirates, bone marrow, ascites fluid, urine, saliva, PBMCs, skin,
      mucosal, tumor and healthy tissue samples from patients with cancer to support basic science
      and clinical research activities of the Medical Oncology Branch and other intramural
      Laboratories and Branches at the NIH Clinical Research Center and Center for Cancer
      Research.

      Objectives:

      To allow long-term storage of biospecimens collected during prospective clinical trials in
      patients with various cancer phenotypes, as needed to support the research activities of the
      Medical Oncology Branch and other Laboratories and Branches.

      Eligibility:

      Samples eligible for long-term retention must be from those who have signed consent for
      storage and retention of biospecimens.

      Design:

      Acquired samples will be barcoded and associated data will be entered into an encrypted
      computer software system, and securely maintained to protect patient identifiers. Samples
      are retained and made available to the original PI, or other Investigators with the original
      PI's permission, following submission and approval of a supplemental research protocol to
      the IRB or OHSRP.
