    <textblock>
      (Bio)medical research, particularly immunological, metabolic, transcriptional or biological
      assays, occasionally require the use of fresh blood (peripheral mononuclear cells) or urine.
      In order to comply with international guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the
      investigators propose to establish a Mini Donor Bank to be able to obtain fresh blood or
      urine from voluntary donors. Recruitment of volunteers will be a continuous process.
      Volunteers will consent to occasional blood- or urine donation.
