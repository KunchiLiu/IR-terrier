    <textblock>
      For optimal jumping performance an adequate interaction of muscles and tendons is required.
      A parameter in the functional evaluation of both structures is their stiffness (resistance
      of the tissue against deformation by external forces). It is unclear so far if higher
      stiffness values of tendon or muscle or a specific stiffness relation of both tissues is the
      cause of better jumping performance. The present study examines this based on the Achilles
      tendon and the calf muscles or the patellar tendon and the hamstrings by three different
      forms of jumps (squat jump, counter-Movement Jump, Drop-Jump).

      The plan is to include young healthy volunteers aged 18 to 40 years. In a cross-sectional
      study, the jump height of the participants will be measured for each jump form: squat jump
      (jump from a squatting position), Counter-Movement Jump (jump with backswing by going into
      the knees) or drop jump (jump from small box with direct re-jump). The order of the jump
      form is determined randomly. The measurements are carried out within one day. Furthermore
      the international physical activity questionnaire will be used in order to assess the level
      of physical activity.

      As primary outcome the stiffness of the calf muscles, achilles tendon, hamstring and
      patellar tendon will be detected. The measurement is carried out before the jumps (there are
      three jumps after one sample jump performed). The measurement is executed non-invasively and
      completely painless using Indentometers and MyotonPro. With both devices, minimal pressure
      on the examined tissue will be exerted and measured how much of this can be compressed.
