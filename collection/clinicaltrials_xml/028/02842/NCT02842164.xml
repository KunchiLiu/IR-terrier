    <textblock>
      Induction of abortion is a hot subject that has complex and emotional controversy. The most
      common time of abortion is the second trimester which represent about 10-15% of all induced
      abortions over the world. As well as, two-thirds of all serious abortion-related
      complications are related to induced second trimester abortion.

      There are many causes for induction of abortion in the second trimester such as missed
      abortion, serious fetal abnormalities such as central nervous system or skeletal
      malformation and lastly some women do not wish to continue a pregnancy and will often seek
      out termination of pregnancy.

      Termination of second trimester is more risky than the first trimester. So many lines have
      been emerged to achieve safe and effective method of termination of second trimester.

      Pharmacologic management seems to be an appealing method for induction of abortion. The
      combing between mifepristone and misoprostol is the effective regimen for termination of
      second trimester abortion with success rate reaching about 97-99% within 24 hours.

      However, mifepristone is not available or affordable in many countries worldwide so
      misoprostol have been used alone but it needs higher total dose with lower effectiveness and
      higher percentage of side effects rate than the combined regimens.

      The optimal method for inducing second trimester nulliparous women with an unfavorable
      cervix is not known. Several studies in literature have described the effectiveness of
      Foley's catheter in cervical ripening and improvement of Bishop's score in women with unripe
      cervices . It may act in addition to its mechanical effect by increasing the release of
      prostaglandin and/or oxytocin release secondary to localized inflammation.

      In practice, the insertion of intra-cervical Foley's catheter balloon is followed by
      applying tension in trial to shorten the time between the insertion and expulsion of the
      fetus, however; this tension adds more pain for the pregnant women with higher rate of
      vaginal bleeding and dissatisfaction.

      Gary et al in 2016 concluded that the application of tension did not result in faster
      delivery times, but did result in faster times to catheter expulsion.

    <description>a 16 French transcervical Foley catheter balloon will be advanced to or past the internal os and the balloon will be filled. Then catheter will be placed on gentle traction by taping the distal tip to the medial thigh for maximum 24 hours. To maintain gentle traction, periodic repositioning of the distal tip on the thigh will be necessary.</description>
