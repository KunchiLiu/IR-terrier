  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine, if it exists, a relation between plateau heart
      rate from the last 3 minutes of the 6-minute stepper test and heart rate from first
      ventilatory threshold from cardiopulmonary exercise testing in order to individualise
      pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with mild to moderate chronicle obstructive pulmonary
      disease.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Relation between plateau heart rate (bpm) from the first and last 3 minutes of the 6-minute stepper test and heart rate (bpm) from first ventilatory threshold from cardiopulmonary exercise testing.</measure>
    <time_frame>Heart rate (bpm) will be assessed during cardiopulmonary exercise testing with electrocardiogram. During the 2 6-minute stepper test, heart will be assessed with oximeter. All theses tests wil be carried out in a total time frame of 3 month maximum.</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome (heart rate) during different tests will be continuously recorded. Relation will be adjusted for age and step count.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relation between minimal SpO2 (%)from the 6-minute stepper test and SpO2 (%) from first ventilatory threshold from cardiopulmonary exercise testing.</measure>
    <time_frame>SpO2 will be assessed with oximeter. All theses tests wil be carried out in a total time frame of 3 month maximum.</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome (SpO2 (%)) during different tests will be continuously recorded. Relation will be adjusted for age en step count.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure (mmHg) before and after every 6-minute stepper test using electrical blood pressure device.</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome will be assessed before and after every 6-minute stepper test. The 2 6-minute stepper test will be carried out the same day (minimum 20 minute of rest between each test) for a total time frame of 1 day.</time_frame>
