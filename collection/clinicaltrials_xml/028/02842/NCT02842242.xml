      The purpose of this phase 2 open-label pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and tolerability of MYK-461 in
      subjects with symptomatic HCM and LVOT obstruction aged 18-70 years.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with HCM (hypertrophied and non-dilated left ventricle in absence of
             systemic or other known cause), with LV wall thickness ≥ 15 mm at time of initial
             diagnosis or ≥ 13 mm with a positive family history of HCM.

          -  Age 18-70

          -  BMI 18-37kg/m2

          -  Documented LVEF ≥ 55% at the Screening visit as determined by the investigator and
             the investigational site's echocardiography laboratory.

          -  Resting LVOT gradient ≥ 30 mg Hg and post-exercise peak LVOT gradient ≥ 50 mm Hg

          -  NYHA functional class II or higher

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

          -  History of syncope with exercise within past 6 months.

          -  Active infection.

          -  Persistent atrial fibrillation or atrial fibrillation at Screening.

          -  Has QTc Fridericia (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms, or any other ECG abnormality considered by the
             investigator to pose a risk to subject safety (e.g. second degree atrioventricular
             block type II).

          -  Aortic stenosis or fixed subaortic obstruction.

          -  History of LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF &lt; 45%) at any time during their clinical
             course.

          -  History of coronary artery disease.

          -  History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition, or
             disease that, in the opinion of the investigator or MyoKardia physician, would pose a
             risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or
             completion.

          -  Ongoing therapy with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or disopyramide.
             Subjects on any of these medications who, in the opinion of the investigator, can
             safely be withdrawn are eligible as long as medication is discontinued at least 14
             days prior to the Screening visit.

          -  Prior treatment with cardiotoxic agents such as doxorubicin or similar, or current
             treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs that have negative inotropic activity, e.g.
             flecainide or propafenone.
