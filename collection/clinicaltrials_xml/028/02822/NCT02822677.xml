    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a cross-sectional study to discovery the distribution of IBS
      subtypes who would like to seek TCM treatment and their TCM patterns. At the same time, the
      investigators will also collect the serum, urine and stool samples of the participants to
      explore the host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions associated with IBS subtypes.

    <textblock>
      It is a cross-sectional study to discovery the distribution of IBS subtypes who would like
      to seek CM treatment and their CM patterns.Serum, urine and stool samples of the
      participants will be collected from 400-600 IBS participants to explore the host-gut
      microbiota metabolic interactions associated with IBS subtypes. The primary outcome will be
      the distribution of IBS subtype and their CM pattern in Hong Kong population. Secondary
      outcomes will be the host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions associated with IBS
      subtypes, the relationship between CM pattern and their microbiota and metabolic profiling.
      The relationship between IBS subtype distribution and other predetermined factors will be
      assessed, including gender, age, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), dietary habit, education,
      economical status, the overall and individual IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS), syndrome
      of Chinese medicine, QoL assessment and Bristol Stool Scale.For those who had fulfillment of
      the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disordersâ€”(SCID-5), the Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale (HAMD-17), Clinical Global Impression-severity (CGI-S), and Self-Rating
      Depression Scale (SDS) will also be assessed. After the collection of serum, urine and stool
      samples, bacterial total DNA will be extracted, purified,concentrated,dried and stored for
      further fecal 16s rRNA sequencing analysis. A number of parameters, including serum alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphate (ALP) et al.,
      will be measured in serum. Total BA and BA profiles in serum and feces will be tested as
      well.

      Serum: The participants will be instructed to meet fasting for the blood sample collection
      and 15ml whole blood will be drawn from the participants.

      Stool: Fecal samples should be naturally excreted from subjects (500ml at least) and should
      be collected without mixing with urine, sanitizer and sewage.

      Urine: Mid-stream morning urine will be collected.
