      This is a multicenter expanded access protocol to provide human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      partially-matched third-party allogeneic EBV-CTLs for the treatment of EBV-associated
      viremia and disease for which there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to
      treat the patient's disease or condition. Patients must not be eligible to enroll in
      clinical trials designed to support the development and marketing approval of Atara
      EBV-CTLs.

      This is a multicenter expanded access protocol to provide human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      partially-matched third-party allogeneic EBV-CTLs for the treatment of EBV-associated
      viremia and disease for which there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to
      treat the patient's disease or condition. Patients must not be eligible to enroll in
      clinical trials designed to support the development and marketing approval of Atara
      EBV-CTLs. Allogeneic third-party EBV-CTL will be selected for the patient from the bank of
      available EBV-CTL cell product lots based on having a partial HLA match and having an
      appropriate HLA restriction shared between the EBV-CTL donor and the patient's EBV
      associated viremia/disease or the patient, as appropriate for the disease setting. EBV-CTLs
      will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle, patients will
      receive intravenous (IV) EBV-CTLs on Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by an observation period to
      complete a 35-day cycle.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Any of the following diagnoses of EBV-associated disease:

               1. EBV+ post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) after allogeneic
                  hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT)

               2. EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) associated with congenital or
                  acquired immunodeficiency

               3. EBV-associated lymphomas and LPDs not associated with immunodeficiency (biopsy
                  required) (eg, EBV+ diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the elderly)

               4. Other EBV-associated malignancies (biopsy required) including nasopharyngeal
                  carcinoma, EBV+ gastric cancer, EBV+ leiomyosarcoma

               5. EBV+ hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

               6. Persistent EBV viremia

          2. Evidence of EBV positivity as follows:

               1. Biopsy showing EBV+ disease (strongly recommended unless required, as noted in
                  criterion #1), OR

               2. A combination of circulating EBV DNA AND radiographic appearance consistent with
                  an EBV+ malignancy, if biopsy is not clinically feasible, unless required per
                  criterion #1, OR

               3. For EBV viremia only, fulfillment of inclusion criteria 1f

          3. Availability of appropriate HLA partially-matched and restricted EBV-CTLs

          4. No other approved alternative therapies available for treatment of EBV+
             viremia/disease

          5. Not eligible for any other trials supporting development of Atara EBV-CTLs

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 3 for patients aged &gt;
             16 years; Lansky score ≥ 20 for patients ≤ 16 years

          7. For patients with PTLD in the alloHCT setting, the underlying disease for which
             alloHCT transplant was performed is in morphologic remission

          8. Adequate organ function per the following (unless deemed to be caused by the
             underlying EBV-driven process which EBV-CTLs are intended to treat, or its prior
             therapy):

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/μL, with or without cytokine support

               2. Platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL, with or without transfusion support; platelet count
                  &lt; 50,000/μL but ≥ 20,000/μL, with or without transfusion support, is permissible
                  if the patient has not had Grade ≥ 2 bleeding in the prior 6 months (where
                  grading of the bleeding is determined per the National Cancer Institute's Common
                  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 4.03).

               3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 3× the
                  upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin &lt; 2.5×ULN; values up to 5×ULN
                  for ALT, AST, and/or total bilirubin are acceptable if the elevation is
                  considered due to EBV-associated disease involvement of the liver

               4. Creatinine &lt; 3×ULN

          9. Patient or patient's representative is willing and able to provide written informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any investigational therapy received ≤ 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (co-enrollment
             in a non-interventional study or a study for sample collection only is permitted)

          2. Ongoing need for methotrexate or extracorporeal photopheresis; steroid doses &gt; 0.5
             mg/kg, as prednisone equivalent, require discussion with the medical monitor

          3. Need for vasopressor or ventilatory support, unless deemed to be caused by the
             EBV-driven process which EBV-CTLs are intended to treat

          4. Antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab, or similar anti-T cell antibody therapy, or T
             cell therapy (donor lymphocyte infusion, other cytotoxic T lymphocytes) ≤ 4 weeks
             prior to Cycle 1 Day 1

          5. Pregnancy, except when, in the opinion of the investigator in consultation with the
             medical monitor, the risk/benefit of EBV-CTL therapy favors proceeding

          6. Female of childbearing potential or male with a female partner of childbearing
             potential unwilling to use a highly effective method of contraception

          7. Inability to comply with study procedures
