  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the safety of CDX-014 and effectiveness (how well the drug
      works).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CDX-014 is an antibody-drug conjugate that binds to a protein called TIM-1, which is found
      on a high percentage of kidney cancer cells and other tumors.

      The study will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma to determine
      the safety and efficacy of CDX-014.

      Eligible patients that enroll to the dose-escalation portion of the study will be assigned
      to one of several levels of CDX-014. The first phase of the study will test the safety
      profile of CDX-014 and determine which dose of CDX-014 will be studied in the Phase II
      portion of the study.

      During Phase II, up to 25 patients will be enrolled and receive the recommended Phase II
      dose of CDX-014.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.

    <description>Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of CDX-014 (in mg/kg). MTD will be defined as the highest dose-level where DLT (dose-limiting toxicity) occurs in less than 33% of treated patients.</description>

    <description>During the treatment phase of the study, patients will receive CDX-014 treatment every 3 weeks as long as they remain eligible. Patients may be discontinued from CDX-014 treatment based on the results of disease assessments or if experiencing side effects that make study therapy intolerable.
Phase I Dose: The planned dose of CDX-014 depends on the cohort assigned at enrollment.
Phase II Dose: The recommended CDX-014 dose will be established from the outcome of the Phase I portion of the study.</description>

          6. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months

          7. If of childbearing potential (male or female), agrees to use effective contraception
             during study treatment and for at least 6 months following last treatment dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior therapy containing MMAE
