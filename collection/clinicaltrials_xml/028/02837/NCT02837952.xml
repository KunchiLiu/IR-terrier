      This study is being conducted to determine the overall analgesic efficacy and safety of a
      fixed-dose ibuprofen 250 mg / acetaminophen 500 mg formulation compared to placebo in
      subjects who are experiencing post operative pain following surgical extraction of 3 or more
      third molar teeth. A review of any reported adverse events will also be completed.
