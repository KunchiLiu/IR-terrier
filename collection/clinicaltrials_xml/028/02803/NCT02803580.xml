  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the characteristics, management and clinical
      course of patients with IPF as treated under real-world in Italian Pulmonary Centres, in
      terms of symptoms, lung function and exercise tolerance during 12 months of observation.
