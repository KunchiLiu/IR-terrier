  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is examining the effects of a cognitive behavioral intervention (an
      intervention focused on changing behaviors and thoughts) for psychogenic non-epileptic
      seizures (PNES, episodes resembling epileptic seizures but with no medical explanation).
      Participants engage in 8 individual therapy sessions consisting of either cognitive
      behavioral therapy or supportive therapy.

      Participants come to our laboratory for a total of 11 sessions. During the initial visit,
      participants complete several questionnaires assessing demographics, personality style,
      relationships with friends and family, as well as past and current PNES symptoms.
      Participants must provide EEG results indicating a diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic
      seizures.

      Participants receive a PNES diary to record all episodes during the course of the study.
      They are randomly assigned to either receive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PNES or
      supportive therapy, and they return 8 times over the next 8 weeks for therapy sessions. If
      randomized to CBT, participants and a family member learn how to change behaviors and
      thoughts to address PNES. If randomized to supportive therapy, they discuss stressors and
      how they relate to the PNES.

      Procedures are the same for each therapy group. The first therapy session lasts
      approximately 90 minutes. All subsequent sessions last about one hour. After completing the
      8 therapy sessions participants return one week later for a follow-up visit lasting
      approximately one hour. This visit consists of answering several questionnaires and an
      interview about current PNES symptoms. Lastly, participants return two months later for a
      final follow-up visit similar to the one week follow up visit.

    <description>CBT-PNES consists of 8 weekly sessions of therapy focused on teaching adolescents to regain control of their body through managing thoughts and behaviors that reinforce the PNES and return to previous activities. It teaches parents how to respond to PNES in a manner that encourages the adolescents to regain control of their body. The PNES is explained as behaviors learned through classical and operant conditioning .</description>

    <description>The supportive therapy treatment consists of 8 weekly sessions of therapy focused on discussing daily difficulties and/or stressors they experience and identifying stress triggers for PNES. The PNES is explained as physical manifestations of psychological stress.</description>
