      Single-visit, unmasked, non-dispensing study where subjects will wear three different lenses
      bilaterally in one visit, each lens being worn for approximately 30-60 minutes. Subjects
      will complete a questionnaire for each study lens.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanical lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>During 30-60 minute wear</time_frame>
    <description>Mechanical lens fit will be assessed for each subject and eye after 30-60 minutes of lens wear. Lens fit is a binary response and 'Yes' = Acceptable Fit and 'No' = Unacceptable Fit. Lens fit is assessed using Lens centration, limbal exposure, primary gaze movement, up-gaze movement, edge lift, lens tightness. Unacceptable fit will be declared if there is any of the following present: limbal exposure, edge lift, excessive movement in primary or up-gaze or insufficient movement in primary gaze and up-gaze. The percentage of subject eyes with acceptable lens fit will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cosmetic Lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>During 30-60 minute wear</time_frame>
    <description>Cosmetic Lens Fit will be assessed for each subject at 3 feet in primary and extreme gazes (temporal, nasal and up-gaze). Acceptable cosmetic lens fit is a binary response where 'Yes' = Acceptable Fit and 'No' = Unacceptable Fit. Acceptable cosmetic lens fit will be declared if the cosmetic pattern covers the outer iris/limbal ring area during the inter-blink completely (for all test positions). The percentage of subject eyes with acceptable cosmetic fit will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contact Lens Handling</measure>
    <time_frame>During 30-60 minute wear</time_frame>
    <description>CLUE Handling is assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE™) Questionnaire. CLUE™ is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact lens-wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable / positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/- 3XSD).</description>

    <measure>Distance Visual Acuity (LogMAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>During 30-60 minute wear</time_frame>
    <description>Distance time controlled LogMAR Visual Acuity will be carried out binocularly with high luminance and high contrast, at 4m using an ETDRS chart. The average Visual Acuity (LogMAR) will be reported.</description>
