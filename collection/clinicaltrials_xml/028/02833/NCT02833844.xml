  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into 2 parts. The first part of the study will be double-blinded and
      will last for 24 weeks. During this time, subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to
      receive either Repatha (evolocumab) QM or placebo QM.

      The second part of the study is a 24-week open label extension period. During this time all
      subjects will receive Repatha (evolocumab) QM.

      The clinical hypothesis is that subcutaneous Repatha (evolocumab) QM will be well tolerated
      and will result in greater reduction of LDL-C, defined as percent change from baseline at
      week 24, compared with placebo QM in HIV-positive subjects with hyperlipidemia or mixed
      dyslipidemia.

      LDL-C = low density lipoprotein cholesterol QM = once monthly Double blind = neither the
      subject, the site staff nor the Sponsor study team will know whether the subject is
      receiving either evolocumab or placebo Open label = all subjects receive evolocumab
