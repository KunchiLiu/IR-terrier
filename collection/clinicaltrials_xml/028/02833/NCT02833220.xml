    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of TMS on the ANS. The investigator
      will determine whether single-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortex in the dominant
      hemisphere in healthy, young adults will affect 1) heart rate and heart rate variability, 2)
      blood pressure and 3) baroreflex function. This study is foundational in that it will begin
      to characterize how single-pulse TMS affects the ANS in healthy adults.

      The overall purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of TMS on the ANS.
      Specifically; the investigator aim to determine if single-pulse TMS of the primary motor
      cortex in the dominant hemisphere in healthy, young adults will significantly affect 1)
      heart rate and heart rate variability, 2) blood pressure and 3) baroreflex function.

      The first purpose of this study is to measure alterations in sympathetic and parasympathetic
      activation in response to TMS. To do this, we will measure HRV immediately after
      single-pulse TMS. The second purpose is to investigate the changes in blood pressure in
      response to TMS and to determine whether the baroreflex, a critical modulator of blood
      pressure, is inhibited by TMS.

      Aim 1: To determine if single-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortex will significantly alter
      heart rate variability. We hypothesize that single-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortex
      will elicit an acute decrease in heart rate and result in improved heart rate variability
      indicated by a significantly decreased LF power and increased HF power.

      Aim 2: To determine if single-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortex will significantly alter
      blood pressure and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). We hypothesize that single-pulse TMS of the
      primary motor cortex will elicit an acute decrease in blood pressure by inhibiting the
      baroreflex.
