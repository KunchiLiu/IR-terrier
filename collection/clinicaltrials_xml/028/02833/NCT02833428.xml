      The aim of this study was to analyze using an artificial intelligence engine (IA) the
      influence of the pathophysiological environment (set parametric monitoring data, imaging,
      biology etc.) of acute spinal cord trauma on spinal pain. This project seeks to establish
      the principles of a new approach for studying spinal cord injury patients. It does not meet
      the usual criteria of clinical trials in so far as it does not test on patients the effect
      of a therapeutic

      Objectives

      The objectives are multiple:

        1. Analyze clinical situation in the pathophysiology of spinal pain.

        2. somatosensory evoked potentials analysis (PES) and motors (PEM) on injuries of the
           spinal cord in the acute phase.

        3. Increasing the mass of data integrated from current standards (volume). The reason is
           not only an imperative of statistical power as in a conventional test but the
           probability of specific events characterize this type of pathology and the consequences
           of their management (monitoring and therapeutic).

        4. Identify new predictive parameters and monitoring of spinal pain.

      5. Design the tools of computer collection, successful storage formats, adaptations of
      collection tools: This is validation of the technical solution (i.e. IA).

      Expected results

      This system will allow to record and analyze a large amount of parameters, largely beyond
      the human resources. Analysis of these data should allow better understanding of the
      pathophysiology of acute trauma of the spinal cord which is an essential prerequisite to
      research new therapies. The realization evoked potentials, ever conducted on this patient in
      the acute phase should also allow the investigators to better understand the mechanisms of
      evolution of the SCI (Spinal Cord Injury).

      Moreover, this model expert system must allow, through the creation of routines, discovering
      new predictive parameters and monitoring, improving the management of these patients.

      This is a completely open system that can be enriched with new parameters as and above all
      enriching also as and when the inclusion of new cases. It therefore offers a theoretical
      field of infinite discovery extremely promising.

    <description>The study will be performed on patients with acute spinal cord injury between the cord next to the C2 vertebra and marrow next to the T12 vertebra. This is usually hospitalized patients in an emergency situation, brought by EMS (emergency medical services) and taken care of immediately in the recovery room by intensivists. Patients who accepted to participate to this study will got the installation bedside biomedical equipment for the project (Eclipse Nim, Medtronic®)</description>

    <description>It is the principal investigator (coordinator investigator moving on the website of the Pitié-Salpêtrière) that will install bedside biomedical equipment for the project (Eclipse Nim, Medtronic®) The term of monitoring will depend of length of stay in the PACU (the post anesthesia care unit) Gaston Cordier and will not exceed 72 hours.
• Patients will be reviewed at 6 and 12 months for conventional control with establishing a ASIA score (American Spinal Cord Injury Association). Of SEP (Somatosensory evoked potentials) and MEP(Motor Engine Potentials) will be performed in the laboratory at 6 and 12 months (electrophysiology laboratory Pitié-Salpêtrière). They are part of the traditional support in the context of spinal cord trauma.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with acute spinal cord injury between the cord opposite the vertebra C2 and
             marrow compared to the T12 vertebra.

          -  neurological lesion classified A, B, C or D according to Frankel classification at
             the initial examination (Annex 1).

          -  Patient able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        There are no exclusion criteria. All patients meeting the inclusion criteria are
        includable. However, it differs remarkable different situations:

          -  The clinical neurological assessment of patients may be difficult depending on the
             context: intubated patients admitted - ventilated multiple trauma.

          -  Neurological assessment via evoked potentials may be difficult depending on the
             environment for patient care: need for multiple investigations, resuscitation. Evoked
             potentials will be installed only after agreement of the healthcare team once the
             patient is stabilized.

          -  The patient can refuse to submit to one additional exam is not part of the standard
             care (i.e. PES / PEM); it will be offered to participate in the study without the
             completion of this review. It will be in this case a simple use of clinical and
             laboratory data collected retrospectively anonymized so for scientific purposes.
