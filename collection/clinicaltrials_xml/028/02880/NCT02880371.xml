  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1b/2 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ARRY-382 in combination with pembrolizumab
      in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors (Part A), to assess the
      pharmacodynamic effects of the combination and to describe the preliminary antitumor
      activity of the combination in patients with advanced unresectable/metastatic melanoma (Part
      B), and to estimate the efficacy of the combination in patients with PD-L1-positive NSCLC
      (Part C).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARRY-382 is an inhibitor of CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor).

      Each part of the study consists of a 28-day screening period, 21-day treatment cycles until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death (or other
      discontinuation criteria are met), and a 30-day safety follow-up period. Patients will be
      monitored for overall survival (OS) until 1 year after the date of the last patient's first
      visit.
