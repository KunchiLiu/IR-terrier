  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain represents an important health problem responsible for decreases in quality of
      life, and is associated with great negative impact in society and economy. In many cases,
      its treatment does not reach therapeutic success causing health professionals and patients
      dissatisfaction. Chronic pain is also associated with somatization, hopelessness and
      catastrophizing thinking. These information processing includes sensorial, emotional and
      cognitive-appraisal thinking, which manifests the working of neural networks at cortical and
      sub-cortical levels. Attention is a central aspect in the processing of pain modulation.
      Like in addictions (e.g. smoking, alcohol), chronic pain may debut with displacement in the
      focus of attention and alterations in the sensorial processing in the incentive-motivation
      tests. Considering that other studies have indicated that experimental and clinical pain is
      capable of modulating cognitive activities such as attention and expectation, in this study
      the investigators will test the hypothesis that the presence of pain will reduce the
      reaction time to visual stimuli related to pain/suffering, and this bias could be modified
      using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

      Will be included women aged between 18 and 65 years, chronic pain fibromyalgia according to
      the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, pain unresponsive to analgesics such
      as paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, Carisoprodol, Zanaflex (Tizanidine) and
      Codeine and give informed consent to participate after initial evaluation. Primary outcome
      is to Evaluate whether the tDCS associated with cognitive retraining technique is able to
      modulate attentional bias in fibromyalgia patients. Secondary outcomes are: compare the
      effect of active tDCS and sham in: Assessed with the Visual Analog Scale for 8 days,
      Functional capacity, Conditional pain modulation (CPM), Maximal Heat Pain
      tolerance,Catastrophic thinking,Serum levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF),
      Beck Depression Inventory, forward and backward digit span( WAIS),Pittsburgh sleep quality
      and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test.

    <description>tDCS was delivered using the anode electrode positioned over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFE) and the cathode electrode at supra orbital right region. The electrodes were placed into a 25-35 cm2 square sponge immersed in saline solution for better current conductivity. Current density used was 2 mA and electrodes attached to the scalp were sustained by rubber band.</description>
