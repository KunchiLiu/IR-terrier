      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety, effectiveness and benefit‐risk profile
      of ResQFoam for the inhospital treatment of exsanguinating, intraabdominal haemorrhage due
      to trauma in patients where emergent laparotomy is required.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Estimated age of 16 years or older (or subject weight estimated at greater than 50 kg
             if age is unknown)

          2. Emergent, exsanguinating haemorrhage, from abdominal source as defined by:

               -  SBP &lt; 90

               -  Activation of massive transfusion protocol AND

               -  Decision made to proceed to emergent laparotomy within 30 minutes of admission

          3. Confirmation of abdominal haemorrhage by:

               -  Positive Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) or

               -  Diagnostic Peritoneal Aspiration (DPA)

          4. The abdomen is considered the primary site of active haemorrhage

          5. Subject is intubated and sedated per local guidelines

          6. Decision to administer foam is made within 30 minutes of admission to the emergency
             department.

          7. Definitive surgical care is expected to occur within three hours of foam deployment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known or suspected major diaphragm injury

          2. Known or suspected untreated pneumothorax

          3. Known or suspected untreated hemothorax

          4. Traumatic brain injury resulting in decapitation, visible brain matter or considered
             non‐ survivable based on initial physical exam

          5. Received greater than five consecutive minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in
             the pre‐emergency department setting

          6. Known allergy to isocyanate

          7. Known or suspected pregnancy

          8. History of prior abdominal surgery or evidence of abdominal surgery (scars)

          9. Disrupted abdominal wall that, in the opinion of the investigator would preclude
             ResQFoam from being adequately contained within the abdominal cavity

         10. Subject in whom the abdominal aortic junctional tourniquet (AAJT) or Resuscitative
             Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) techniques have been used

         11. Known Prisoners

         12. Subjects with burns &gt; 20% of total body surface area

         13. Known Do Not Resuscitate order (DNR) or Physician Orders for Life Sustaining
             Treatment (POLST)

         14. Enrolled in another randomized, interventional study
