  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is real-time myocardial perfusion echocardiography (RTMPE) a feasible and effective
      non-invasive method to detect significant Coronary Allograft Vasculopathy in pediatric and
      adult cardiac transplant recipients? Will perfusion deficits correlate with significant
      coronary artery stenosis identified by standard stress echocardiography and Invasive
      Coronary Angiography (ICA), and identify diffuse small vessel disease more effectively than
      current non-invasive techniques?

    <textblock>
      Heart transplant recipients are susceptible to developing a unique disease that causes
      blockages in the arteries of the transplanted heart (coronary arteries) called Coronary
      Allograft Vasculopathy (CAV). Because CAV often progresses without symptoms, transplant
      recipients undergo regular surveillance testing so that CAV can be detected and treatment
      can be offered before significant damage to the transplanted heart occurs. Current tests
      used to detect CAV are either invasive (with risk of complications) or may not be able to
      detect CAV in its early stages. Myocardial contrast perfusion echocardiography is a safe
      non-invasive diagnostic test that may be well suited for detecting CAV, however has not been
      well studied in heart transplant recipients. This study examines the ability of myocardial
      contrast perfusion echocardiography to detect CAV in adult and pediatric heart transplant
      recipients, and compare those results to current standard testing strategies such as
      Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA) and standard stress echocardiography. This will help
      determine whether myocardial contrast perfusion echocardiography is a better test for
      regular surveillance of CAV in adult and pediatric transplant recipients.
