  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the potential for improving balance for a single individual with a
      history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The participant will engage in supervised therapy
      using commercial games on the Xbox Kinect. This study will also evaluate the viability of
      improving cardiovascular fitness using this intervention as well. The investigators
      hypothesize that balance improvements will occur and that using the Xbox Kinect is a viable
      way of improving cardiovascular fitness.

    <textblock>
      Various forms of virtual reality (VR) training have been recently used for rehabilitation of
      neurological impairments including postural stability and coordination. Virtual reality
      training has also been shown to increase motivation and attention through its use of novel
      goal-directed challenges. The Xbox Kinect gaming system allows the Veteran to perform
      challenging full-body and goal-oriented activities. Balance improvements using laboratory
      developed games have been demonstrated in those with a history of TBI. However, the
      investigators are specifically interested if improvements can be made using commercial games
      which can be utilized in physical therapy clinics more readily. Exercise gaming has been
      shown to provide adequate intensity exercise to improve heart health in the healthy
      population. However, such benefits have not yet been investigated using the Xbox Kinect for
      individuals with a history of TBI.

    <measure>Dynamic Gait Index (DGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from (Baseline) Weeks 1,2,3,4,6,13,14 to (Intervention) Weeks 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 and to (Retention) Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</time_frame>
    <description>The DGI is a common clinical measure used to evaluate dynamic balance and coordination during a person's daily activities. This test was developed by Shumway-Cook and features 8-items which assess a person's ability to walk while turning their head, changing speed, and navigating obstacles. The DGI has a maximal score of 24.</description>

    <measure>Limits of Stability (LOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>(Baseline) Weeks 1,2,3,4,6,13,14; (Intervention) Weeks 1, 3, 4, 6, 8; (Retention) Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</time_frame>
    <description>The LOS is performed on the NeuroCom Balance Manager. The LOS test is a goal-directed weight shifting task. The LOS measure provides an overall composite score of 5 items recorded during the test and then compared to age-matched norms. This is reported as a relative percentage without units.</description>

    <time_frame>(Baseline) Weeks 1,2,3,4,6,13,14; (Intervention) Weeks 1, 3, 4, 6, 8; (Retention) Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</time_frame>
    <description>The AFB is a patient-reported questionnaire which rates levels of fatigue over the previous week.</description>

    <measure>Functional Reach Test</measure>

    <description>The purpose of the FRT is to assess a patient's stability by measuring the maximum distance an individual can reach forward while standing in a fixed position. Three trials are performed where the patient is asked to stand close to, but not touching, a wall and to reach forward with the shoulder flexed to 90 degrees.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Total Activity Time (TAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>(Intervention) 2 times per week for 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TAT is a measure of the total time that the Veteran will be participating in mini-game challenges during the 60 minute intervention session.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Time in Therapeutic Heart Rate Range (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>(Intervention) 2 times per week for 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is the amount of time the Veteran spends within the target heart range of moderate exercise prescribed by the 40-60% heart rate reserve calculation.</description>

    <description>The Veteran completed 15 sessions of supervised VR training. Each session lasted between 50 and 60 minutes in total. The intervention utilized 2 commercially available Xbox One Kinect games called &quot;Shape Up&quot; and &quot;Kinect Sports: Rivals&quot; to challenge both cardiovascular and balance systems. Each game is composed of mini-games (MG). Each MG lasted between 1:30 minutes to 4:00 minutes. Both games were played for approximately 25 minutes during each session. Rest breaks were allowed as the participant required them. Guarding by a therapist was provided dependent on the challenge of the game and the participant's abilities.</description>
