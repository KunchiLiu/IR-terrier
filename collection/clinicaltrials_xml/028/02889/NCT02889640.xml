      This research aims to examine the extent to which a promising academic
      intervention—high-intensity tutoring by SAGA Innovations—that has previously been shown to
      significantly improve academic outcomes for disadvantaged Chicago youth can be implemented
      at an even greater scale. By taking advantage of the power of random sampling, this study
      will allow for observation of the program's effectiveness as if it were running at five
      times the proposed scale. In addition, this study will explicitly explore the extent to
      which there is a trade-off between effectiveness and scale.

      The University of Chicago Education Lab research team is carrying out a randomized
      controlled trial during the 2016-2017 academic year to build on previous collaborations with
      the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and SAGA Innovations that have found that SAGA's intensive,
      individualized, during-the-school-day tutoring can generate very large gains in academic
      outcomes in a short period of time, even among students who are many years behind grade
      level. This research suggests the promise of this approach for improving the academic skills
      and educational attainment of disadvantaged youth, even once they have reached adolescence,
      both in Chicago and in distressed urban districts across the country. However, to truly
      affect outcomes at the local and national level, SAGA would have to be rolled out on a much
      greater scale than researchers have been able to study in Chicago. Yet little is known about
      how to take promising interventions to scale. This study seeks to build the science of
      scale-up, by examining the extent to which this individualized tutoring program can be
      implemented at an even greater scale and by explicitly exploring the trade-offs between
      effectiveness and scale.

      The SAGA Innovations program expands on the nationally recognized innovation of high-dosage,
      in-school-day tutoring developed in Match Education's charter school in Boston. The tutoring
      program meets as a scheduled course, Math Lab, once a day during the normal school day, and
      is provided in addition to a student's regular math class. Students taking the course
      receive an elective credit upon completion. Students work two-on-one (two students with one
      tutor) with the same full-time, professional tutor for the entirety of the school year. The
      content of the tutoring sessions is aligned with what students are learning in their regular
      math courses, but is also targeted to address individual gaps in math knowledge. Also
      following the original model developed by Match Education, SAGA tutors use frequent internal
      formative assessments of student progress to individualize instruction.

      A previous randomized controlled trial conducted by the University of Chicago research team
      found that one year of this intervention, delivered in AY2013-14, generated between one and
      two extra years of academic growth in math, over and above what the normal U.S. high school
      student learns in one year (Cook et al., 2015; Reardon 2011). The estimated effects for math
      achievement are on the order of 0.19 to 0.30 SD, depending on the exact test and norming
      used. This effect is equivalent to closing up to one-third of the black-white test score gap
      in math in the NAEP among thirteen-year-olds (0.80 SD), in just one year. The intervention
      also improved student grades in math by 0.58 points on a 1-4 grade point scale, compared to
      a control mean of 1.77. These gains are particularly important because of the growing
      evidence on the importance of math specifically for short- and medium-term success in
      school, and for long-term life outcomes such as employment and earnings (Duncan et al.,
      2007).

      This study aims to build upon the investigators' previous evaluations of the program, and
      will provide insight into the ability of this program to serve youth at a much larger scale.
      The investigators will take advantage of the power of random sampling to study scale-up of
      this program without actually having to implement the program at a much larger scale. For
      example, in 2016-17 academic year, SAGA will be serving about 1,200 kids in the Chicago
      Public Schools, and so will need to hire about 100 tutors. Researchers believe they can
      simulate the range of tutors SAGA would need to hire if it were being delivered on a much
      larger scale in Chicago—say, to 3,000 students. To serve 3,000 students, SAGA would have to
      hire 250 tutors. To hire 250 tutors, SAGA would typically recruit a pool of 2,000
      applicants, of which about 1,000 would be deemed qualified enough to be interviewed. To
      simulate this hiring process and the tutors SAGA would hire if they were serving 3,000
      students, researchers will have SAGA recruit a target of 1,000 interview-able applicants,
      and will randomly select one in five for them to actually interview. SAGA will then offer
      the position to their top 50 candidates from this pool of 200 interviews. Simulations
      suggest that this approach will provide an unbiased estimate of the 250 tutors that would
      have been hired had the program been implemented at five times the proposed scale. SAGA
      staff will also rank these 50 tutors (hereby referred to as &quot;scale-up tutors&quot;) based on
      expected success in improving academic outcomes of students, to enable the researchers to
      examine the extent to which tutor ranking moderates program effects. SAGA will be
      responsible for the recruitment of tutors, and will use their standard recruitment methods
      (career fairs, job postings, online advertisements, etc.) to reach the anticipated 1,000
      interview-able applicants. SAGA will also select another set of 50 tutors via their standard
      hiring process (hereby referred to as &quot;standard tutors&quot;), which does not involve
      randomization. These 50 standard tutors will allow the investigators to compare the
      effectiveness of SAGA tutoring when implemented on a small versus large scale.

      The schools in this study will also be divided into two sets, based on whether SAGA tutoring
      has been implemented there in the past. In about half of the schools, where SAGA-style
      tutoring has been implemented since AY2013-14 or AY2014-15, researchers will allow schools
      to choose which students they believe should participate in tutoring. In the second half of
      schools, which have never implemented SAGA-style tutoring, investigators will administer the
      program as a randomized controlled trial, by identifying youth who are at elevated risk for
      failing academically and randomly assigning them to one of two conditions—SAGA tutoring, or
      a control group receiving status quo school and community services. In both sets of schools,
      the students assigned to tutoring will be randomly assigned to a particular tutor in their
      school. For the scale-up tutors, this random assignment of students to tutors coupled with
      the randomization of tutor selection will allow researchers to examine the impact of
      individualized tutoring as if 250 tutors were hired, and will enable researchers to
      empirically estimate the supply curve for implementing this individualized tutoring program
      at much larger scale. For the standard tutors, the random assignment of students to tutors
      will allow researchers to examine the effect of implementing the individualized tutoring on
      a small scale, if just 50 tutors were hired.

      At the end of AY2016-17, researchers will examine the impact of this program on important
      academic and behavioral outcomes. This includes outcomes such as GPA, credits attempted,
      credits earned, standardized test scores, and crime involvement. Researchers will also have
      access SAGA's programmatic data on tutor characteristics, which includes demographic
      information and information on math and teacher training, to assess the variation in the
      effectiveness of tutors and to examine the degree to which tutor characteristics correspond
      to different student outcomes.

      Researchers believe the proposed project will provide valuable insights into how to scale up
      what may turn out to be an extremely cost-effective way to improve educational outcomes for
      low-income youth. But perhaps more importantly, the hope is that this work will contribute
      to a broader understanding of how program scale affects program quality and how to
      systematically study this relationship. The investigators hope this project will create a
      &quot;roadmap&quot; for a growing body of research on the science of scale-up, guiding efforts of
      future researchers to understand the implications of scale up for interventions with scarce
      inputs.
