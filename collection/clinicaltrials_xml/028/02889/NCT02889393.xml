  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether teduglutide is safe and feasible to be
      given for the treatment of enterocutaneous fistula (ECF). We hypothesize that the drug will
      be well-tolerated and will improve the volume of daily ECF output as well as improve the
      functional quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be initially randomly assigned to either daily subcutaneous
      teduglutide injections (0.05 mg/kg/d) for 8 weeks or continued standard of care for 8 weeks.
      After 8 weeks, the groups will cross over.
