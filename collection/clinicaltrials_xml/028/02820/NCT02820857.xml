  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) are a sub-group of aggressive
      neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN). The most common primary sites are broncho-pulmonary and
      digestive. The gastroentero-pancreatic NECs (GEP-NEC) represent 7-21% of all of the NENs.

      Recent data on the initial presentation of GEP-NEC have been reported in two retrospective
      studies and a French cohort study. No standard second-line treatment has been defined for
      NECs. Despite a very negative prognosis, these NECs have a certain amount of
      chemosensitivity, close to that of bronchial NECs. Multiple-drug therapies such as Folfiri,
      or Folfox, or single drug treatments such as temozolomide are the proposed options but with
      a low level of proof Bevacizumab associated with a cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown
      promising results in well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET), known for being
      hypervascular. The efficacy of bevacizumab has also been suggested in patients with NEC, but
      never in the context of a phase II study. Its combination with Folfiri is efficient and well
      tolerated in metastatic colorectal cancer. The combination Folfiri-bevacizumab potentially
      represents an optimized treatment compared to chemotherapy with only Folfiri. No phase II or
      III studies have reported results for these patients, and no on-going phase II or III trial
      have been identified to date.

      The main objective of this study is to show that, after the failure of a first-line
      chemotherapy using platinum-etoposide, the combination Folfiri-bevacizumab allows
      significant prolongation of overall survival in adult patients with GEP-NEC.
