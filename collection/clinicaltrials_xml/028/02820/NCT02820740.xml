      Multicenter, open-label, prospective designed study to characterize the performance of brain
      laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) ablation using the Monteris NeuroBlate System for
      the treatment of drug-refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy in subjects who are
      candidates for LITT surgery.

      Monteris is sponsoring this multicenter, open-label, prospective feasibility study to
      characterize the performance of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) using the Monteris
      NeuroBlate System for the treatment of drug-refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy in
      subjects who are candidates for LITT surgery.

      The NeuroBlate System uses precise, high-intensity laser light to initiate necrosis of
      abnormal brain tissue through thermal ablation while limiting injury to healthy tissue.
      Unlike traditional brain surgery, LITT does not require a large opening in the skull.

      Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria and sign the informed consent form will
      enter a Baseline (pre-surgery) Phase to establish their baseline seizure frequency.
      Subjects, or their caregivers, are required to keep a seizure diary throughout the study,
      beginning at the first baseline visit. The study will monitor and record subjects' seizure
      frequency, antiepileptic medications, and physical and emotional health.

      Upon demonstrating the required seizure frequency and stable antiepileptic medications for
      the 3-Month Baseline Phase, subjects will qualify for the study procedure. Subjects treated
      with NeuroBlate will have 2 years of follow-up. Throughout study participation, the study
      investigator will continuously monitor and document both effectiveness and safety data at
      study appointments.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Relevant Inclusion Criteria are listed below

          -  Diagnosis of unilateral medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) confirmed clinically and
             with either (1) ictal scalp recording and MRI evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis
             or (2) intracranial ictal onset consistent with hippocampal origin

          -  Averages 3 or more complex partial seizures (with or without secondary
             generalization) per month

          -  Refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Subjects will be considered refractory if
             they have failed treatment with at least 2 AEDs due to lack of efficacy

          -  Meets the criteria for a medial temporal lobe resection and is a candidate for LITT

          -  18 years or older at the time of consent

        Relevant Exclusion Criteria are listed below

          -  Previous diagnosis of psychogenic/non-epileptic seizures

          -  Previous diagnosis of primary generalized seizures

          -  IQ less than 70

          -  Subject has a MRI-incompatible implanted electronic device or any metallic prosthesis
             or implant for which brain MRI is contraindicated
