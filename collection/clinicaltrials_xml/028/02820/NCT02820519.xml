  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loxapine is an antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in several
      countries including the United States. In animal studies in mice, loxapine reduced
      neuropathic pain. Hence, in a proof-of-principle and dose-escalating study the tolerability
      and analgesic efficacy of loxapine will be evaluated in patients with neuropathic pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this dose-escalating study, 12 patients with refractory, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic
      pain (including mixed pain) will receive loxapine during four 14-days treatment episodes.
      The dosage for episode 1 (Days 1-14) will be 10 mg b.i.d., dosages for episodes 2, 3, and 4
      will be defined by taking into account tolerability and analgesic efficacy of the former
      episode. In case of an acceptable tolerability and if a clinically relevant analgesic
      efficacy is not reached, loxapine dosage will be increased (2nd Episode 10 mg t.i.d, 3rd
      Episode 20 mg b.i.d., 4th episode 20 mg t.i.d.). In case of an acceptable tolerability and
      if a clinically relevant analgesic efficacy is reached, loxapine dosage will not be changed.
      If clinically relevant (serious) adverse events ((S)AEs) occur, loxapine dosage will be
      reduced or the treatment will be interrupted or stopped irrespective of the analgesic
      efficacy. A clinically relevant pain reduction / analgesic efficacy is defined by an at
      least 30% decrease or an absolute decrease of two scale units compared to baseline using
      11-point numeric pain rating scale. Patients will receive loxapine as add-on treatment to
      their usual (analgesic) care.
