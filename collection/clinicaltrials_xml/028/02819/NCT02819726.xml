    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study to compare the PK, PD,
      safety, efficacy, tolerability, and immunogenicity of SAIT101 versus MabThera® versus
      Rituxan® in patients with RA. This study will take place globally across approximately 70
      study centers in order to randomize approximately 282 patients. The study consists of Part A
      from baseline for PK and efficacy analysis, followed by Part B from Week 24 to 52 for safety
      follow-up that also collects transition data.

          2. Patients with severe RA who have had an inadequate response to at least 3 months'
             treatment (according to the approved treatment and dosage) or intolerance (at
             Investigator's discretion and/or experience of intolerable AE or toxicity such as
             infusion related reaction, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis or severe toxicity) to
             anti-TNF therapy (experience of severe AE or toxicity).

             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level &lt;20 IU/mL (or 112 copies/mL) by polymerase chain
             reaction (PCR). These HBV patients must be willing to undergo monthly PCR HBV DNA
             testing during treatment and may participate following consultation with a hepatitis
             expert regarding monitoring and use of HBV antiviral therapy, and provided they agree

         12. History of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or
             history of severe COPD exacerbation(s) within the last 12 months of Screening.

         13. Vaccination with live or attenuated vaccines within 6 weeks prior to first dose of
             study drug or planned administration during study participation or within 4 weeks
             following discontinuation of study drug. Treatment with IV Gamma Globulin or the
             Prosorba® Column within 6 months prior to Day 1.

             cells/μL at Screening. If a patient has findings marginally below this limit,
             re-testing is allowed, at the Investigator's discretion, within the 30 day period
             between Visit 1 and Visit 2.

         17. Serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL (&gt;176.8 μmol/L) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
             (measured using a modified Cockgroft-Gault equation) &lt;50 mL/min/1.73m2.

             Liver function: Total bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL (&gt;34 μmol/L) except for patients with
             Gilbert's Syndrome or hemolysis. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3 × upper limit of normal (ULN). Patients with total
             bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL possibly due to Gilbert's Syndrome should have a direct
             bilirubin checked. If the direct bilirubin is normal and medical history is
             suggestive/positive for Gilbert's Syndrome, the patient successfully meets the
             criteria.

             The AST and ALT may be repeated once within the Screening period if the initial
             result exceeds this limit, and the lesser value accepted if it meets this criterion.

             received treatment with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any
             indication within a minimum of 5 half-lives prior to Day 1.

         23. Patients who, based on the Investigator's judgment, have a clinically significant or
             unstable medical or surgical condition that may preclude safe and complete study
             participation. Conditions may also include cardiovascular, vascular, pulmonary,
             hepatic, renal, endocrine or neurological conditions as determined by medical
             history, physical examination, laboratory tests or electrocardiogram (ECG).
