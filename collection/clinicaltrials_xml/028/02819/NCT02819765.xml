      This study aims to establish a biorepository and phenotyping database to investigate
      longitudinal changes in ALS subjects. Blood, including DNA and RNA, cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) and electrophysiologic measures will be collected every 3 months over 1 year. The
      database and specimen repository will be made available to ALS researchers on a merit basis.

      Rationale for the Study

      The Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) biorepository is an existing resource which has
      provided scientists with a wide range of samples associated with clinical information. It is
      primarily cross sectional in nature; longitudinal collections have been associated with a
      limited set of clinical and functional assessments. The investigators goal is to continue to
      build this repository with the collection protocol proposed here, to associate biofluid
      collection with specific measures of upper and lower motor neuron function. This project
      will compliment others to upgrade the NEALS biorepository infrastructure, including updating
      the computer systems, expanding the number of sample freezers and establishing a repository
      in the Western United States, and strengthening the standard operating procedures for the
      repository. The project also supports existing efforts to expand the biorepository by
      collecting new blood and spinal fluid samples from people with ALS.

      Study Design This is a multicenter, non interventional, longitudinal study in patients with
      ALS. There will be four (4) subject visits in this study: Baseline, month 6, month 12, and
      month 18. At each visit, subjects will have biofluids collected, and be evaluated with
      assessment tools that focus on upper and lower motor neuron burden as well as cognitive
      function.

      Study Objectives and Endpoints The primary objective of the study is to obtain deep
      phenotyping information on patients studied at regular intervals over 18 months, in
      conjunction with biofluid collection over that same time period.

      The secondary objective of the study is to integrate data from this study to other ongoing
      projects via the NEALS biorepository, and future collections now being planned.

      Endpoints for the study are:

        -  Motor unit number estimation will be performed on bilateral upper extremity muscles
           using the multipoint incremental technique (MIMUNE);

        -  Vital capacity, measured using slow vital capacity (SVC).

        -  Lower motor neuron excitability will be assessed with threshold tracking nerve
           conduction studies (ttNCS) in the least affected intrinsic hand muscle.

        -  Cognitive abnormalities will be assessed using the ALS Cognitive Behavior Screen
           (ALS-CBS);

        -  Upper motor neuron burden will be assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation
           (TMS), employing a paired pulse protocol and recording from the least affected upper
           extremity intrinsic hand muscle;

        -  Hand held dynamometry (HHD) will be performed on 10 muscle groups tested bilaterally;

        -  Global function (ALSFRS-R); and

        -  Vital capacity, measured using slow vital capacity (SVC). At each visit, blood will be
           collected and banked for biomarker discovery; CSF will be collected at baseline, month
           6, and at month 18.

      Study Locations Approximately 10-15 Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) Centers in the US will
      participate in the study. Sites that cannot perform the ttNCS and/or the TMS can still
      participate.

      Number of Planned Subjects One hundred fifty (150) subjects will be in the study. It is
      estimated that 10 to 15 subjects shall be enrolled per site.

      Study Population This study will be conducted in subjects who meet the El Escorial criteria
      of possible, laboratory- supported probable, probable, or definite ALS. Time from diagnosis
      to study entry must be 24 months or less. At screening, eligible subjects must be at least
      18 years old and must provide written informed consent. Detailed criteria will be described
      in the full protocol.

      Duration of Study Active assessment period will be 18 months; a 1-year enrolment period is
      expected.

Mean and standard deviation for each muscle group will be established from the initial values for each subject in this trial, so that strength determinations can be converted to Z scores and averaged to provide an HHD megascore for both upper and lower extremities.</description>

    <measure>ALS cognitive behavioral screen (ALS-CBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months through month 18</time_frame>
    <description>The ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBSâ„¢) is a short measure of cognition and behavior in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The cognitive section includes commonly used elements of standard testing batteries, consisting of 8 tasks, with a possible total score of 20. It can be administered by a physician or other clinical care staff and takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. The behavioral section (ALS Caregiver Behavioral Questionnaire) is composed of questions sensitive to organic brain changes. It consists of a set of questions that compare changes in personality and behavior since the onset of ALS, as well as yes/no questions about mood, pseudobulbar affect, and fatigue. It is completed by a caregiver, family member or other informant during the same time that the patient completes the cognitive portion. The questionnaire typically takes about 2 minutes to complete.</description>
