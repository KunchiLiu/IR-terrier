      This project is an adaptation trial, testing the efficacy of an evidence-based community
      wellness program, Enhance Wellness (http://www.projectenhance.org/enhancewellness.aspx), in
      a sample of middle and older-aged adults living with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury,
      post-polio syndrome and muscular dystrophy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a quasi-experimental project, comparing the effects of Enhance Wellness in a sample
      of adults aged 45 years or older and living with long-term physical disability, to two
      quasi-control groups: a sample of adults without long-term disability participating in
      Enhance Wellness, and a sample of adults with long-term disability not participating in
      Enhance Wellness. Outcomes are collected pre-intervention and post-intervention,
      approximately 6-months apart.
