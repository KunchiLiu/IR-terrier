    <textblock>
      This is a four year project evaluating the effectiveness of a group-based lifestyle
      intervention (PeerFIT) supported by mHealth technology and social media compared to Basic
      Education in fitness and nutrition supported by a wearable Activity Tracking device (BEAT)
      in achieving clinically significant improvements in weight loss and cardiorespiratory
      fitness in young adults with SMI.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a group-based lifestyle
      intervention (PeerFIT) supported by mHealth technology and social media to promote weight
      loss and improved fitness in young adults with SMI. The study is a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial conducted in real world mental health settings to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the 12-month PeerFIT intervention compared to Basic Education in fitness
      and nutrition supported by a wearable Activity Tracking device (BEAT) in achieving
      clinically significant improvements in weight loss and cardiorespiratory fitness. The
      investigators will enroll 144 overweight and obese (BMI â‰¥ 25) young adults ages 19 to 30
      with SMI attending one of two community mental health organizations situated within the
      Massachusetts Department of Mental Health who are interested in losing weight and improving
      fitness. The investigators hypothesize that PeerFIT compared to BEAT will be associated with
      a greater proportion of participants who achieve cardiovascular risk reduction at 6 and 12
      months follow-up as indicated by either clinically significant weight loss (5% or greater)
      or increased fitness (&gt;50 m on the six-minute walk test). They will also investigate two
      theoretical mechanisms of action hypothesized to account for greater weight loss and
      increased cardiorespiratory fitness among participants assigned to PeerFIT: 1) improved
      self-efficacy and 2) increased peer support for health behavior change. The investigators
      hypothesize that the relationship between PeerFIT and weight loss and improved fitness will
      be mediated by improved self-efficacy and peer support for health behavior change.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' weight will be measured in pounds (lbs.) on a flat, even surface with the use of a high-quality, calibrated professional medical scale, with the participant wearing indoor clothing and no shoes.</description>

    <measure>Change in 6-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>After a baseline pulse has been obtained, participants are asked to walk a measured distance as far as they are able in 6 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in weight loss self-efficacy assessed using the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle (WEL) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Weight Efficacy Lifestyle (WEL) questionnaire will be used to measure self-efficacy for weight loss. The WEL consists of 20 items designed to measure self-confidence to control weight by resisting overeating in certain tempting situations. The total score will be used in analyses. The items are scored on a 10-point Likert scale from 0 (&quot;not confident&quot;) to 10 (&quot;very confident&quot;) and total score calculated as the sum of individual item responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-efficacy for exercise behaviors assessed using the Self-efficacy for Exercise Behaviors (SEB) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-efficacy for Exercise Behaviors (SEB) scale will be used to measure participants' self-efficacy related to the ability to exercise despite barriers. The 12-item scale consists of common barriers that might affect participation in exercise (e.g., feeling depressed, socializing, stressful life changes, household chores). For each situation, participants use the scale from 1 (&quot;I know I cannot&quot;) to 5 (&quot;I know I can&quot;) to describe his or her confidence that they could exercise in the face of these barriers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in peer support for health behavior change assessed using the 24-item Social Provisions Scale (SPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' level of perceived peer support will be measured with the 24-item Social Provisions Scale (SPS). The SPS assesses six types of support from social relationships (guidance, reliable alliance, reassurance of worth, attachment, social integration, and opportunity for nurturance) and the total score will be used in the analysis. The items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 (&quot;strongly disagree) to 4 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;) as it pertains to relationships with group members. Higher scores indicate greater perceived support from group relationships.</description>

    <description>Lipids will be measured using the CardioChek PA Analyzer, a hand-held dual testing system that produces values for total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides using a multi-panel test strip and a single drop of blood acquired with a finger prick.</description>

    <description>Participants in BEAT receive materials with tips and strategies for healthy eating and physical activity. They are also given a wearable activity tracker (i.e., Fitbit Zip) to use throughout the study with instructions for using the device and connecting it with a personal smartphone, tablet, or computer. Following an initial educational session, participants in BEAT have access to once monthly technical assistance meetings with a lifestyle coach who can make sure the Fitbit is working properly, answer any questions about the device, and show participants how to check progress by synching the Fitbit to a personal computer or smartphone.</description>

    <ipd_description>The proposed project involves human subject data, and all data collected on subjects (both positive and negative) will be submitted to the National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness (NDCT). This will include individual level data from all subjects enrolled in both the active intervention and control conditions.
The NDCT is a secure data repository run by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) that allows researchers to collect and share de-identified information with each other. This secure informatics platform facilitates scientific collaboration and data sharing, and enables effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. The NDCT links data across research projects using Global Unique Identifiers (GUID) for each participant, and the NDCT Data Dictionary.</ipd_description>
