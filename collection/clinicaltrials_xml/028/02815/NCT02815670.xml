  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial objective is to demonstrate the safety of idarucizumab, as assessed by the
      occurence of patients with drug related adverse events (including immune reactions) and
      all-cause mortality in paediatric venous thromboembolism patients treated with dabigatran in
      ongoing clinical trials who require emergency surgery/urgent procedures or patients who have
      life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding which requires urgent intervention, when rapid
      reversal of the anticoalugant effect of dabigatran is needed.

        Inclusion criteria:

        Patients taking dabigatran etexilate in the paediatric trials 1160.106 or 1160.108 are
        eligible for this trial if they meet the following criteria:

        Group A:

          -  Overt bleeding judged by the treating physician to require a reversal agent.

          -  Currently taking dabigatran etexilate in the context of a clinical trial with
             dabigatran etexilate (1160.106 or 1160.108).

          -  Male or female patients from 0 to less than 18 years of age at the time of informed
             consent/assent for participation in trial 1160.106 or in trial 1160.108.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential (defined as having experienced menarche)
             must have followed the contraception requirements according to the dabigatran trial
             1160.106 or trial 1160.108 in which they are enrolled.

          -  Written informed consent provided by the patient (and/or the patient's legally
             accepted representative) and assent provided by the patient (if applicable) at the

             within the following 8 hours.

          -  Currently taking dabigatran etexilate in the context of a clinical trial with
             dabigatran etexilate (1160.106 or 1160.108).

          -  Male or female patients from 0 to less than 18 years of age at the time of informed
             consent/assent for participation in trial 1160.106 or in trial 1160.108.

             unmanageable bleeding is low.

          -  Patients with body weight &lt; 2.5 kg

          -  Contraindications to trial medication including known hypersensitivity to the drug or
             its excipients; i.e. patients with hereditary fructose intolerance who may react to
