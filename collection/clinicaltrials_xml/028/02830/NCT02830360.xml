  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine the feasibility of a larger scale multicenter trial
      comparing first line catheter ablation to antiarrhythmic drug therapy for patients with
      prior MI, an ICD and VT.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicentre, parallel group, two arm, unblinded vanguard pilot randomized
      clinical trial. A vanguard pilot study design is chosen in order to prove feasibility
      without committing to the full trial until feasibility is demonstrated. Implantable
      Defibrillators (ICDs) reduce sudden death and can terminate some VT without shocks, but they
      don't prevent VT; the most appropriate strategy to suppress VT remains unknown. The
      widespread use of ICDs means patients who formerly would have suffered sudden death now
      survive, and may experience recurrent VT and ICD therapy. Therapeutic options for VT are
      limited. Appropriate ICD programming reduces unnecessary shocks, but VT may still recur and
      require therapy. VANISH 2 will assess the outcomes of patients with prior MI and VT
      randomized to catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior Myocardial Infarction and

          -  One of the following VT events while not being treated with amiodarone, sotalol, or
             another class I or class III antiarrhythmic drug) within the last 6 months:

               -  Sustained monomorphic VT documented on 12-lead ECG or rhythm strip terminated by
                  pharmacologic means or DC cardioversion

               -  ≥3 episodes of VT treated with antitachycardia pacing (ATP), at least one of
                  which should be symptomatic

               -  ≥ 5 episodes of VT treated with antitachycardia pacing (ATP) regardless of
                  symptoms

               -  ≥1 appropriate ICD shocks,

               -  ≥3 VT episodes within 24 hours

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent.

          -  Active ischemia (acute thrombus diagnosed by coronary angiography, or dynamic ST
             segment changes demonstrated on ECG) or another reversible cause of VT (e.g.
             drug-induced arrhythmia), had recent acute coronary syndrome within 30 days, coronary
             revascularization (&lt;90 days bypass surgery, &lt;30 days percutaneous coronary
             intervention), or have CCS functional class IV angina. Note that biomarker level
             elevation alone after ventricular arrhythmias does not denote acute coronary syndrome
             or active ischemia.

          -  Are ineligible for both sotalol (based upon the criteria listed in section 3.2.1 or
             known intolerance/allergy), and amiodarone (e.g. due to active hepatitis, current
             hyperthyroidism, pulmonary fibrosis, known allergy).

          -  Are known to have protruding left ventricular thrombus or mechanical aortic and
             mitral valves

          -  Have had a prior catheter ablation procedure for VT

          -  Are in renal failure (Creatinine clearance &lt;15 mL/min), have NYHA Functional class IV
             heart failure, or a systemic illness likely to limit survival to &lt;1 year

          -  Have had recent ST elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST elevation MI (&lt; 30
             days); note that biomarker elevation alone after ventricular arrhythmias does not
             denote MI.

          -  Are pregnant.
