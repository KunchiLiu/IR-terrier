    <time_frame>Collected at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Spine Oncology Study Group developed and validated a 6-point grading system to describe the degree of epidural spinal cord compression based on axial T2-weighted MR images at the site of most severe compression. This assessment can be used to help guide treatment and can serve as a classification scheme.</description>

    <measure>Symptoms: Spine Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Spine Oncology Study Group developed and validated a classification system to assist clinicians in defining tumor-related instability. It is assessed by adding together six individual component scores: spine location, pain, lesion bone quality, radiographic alignment, vertebral body collapse, and posterolateral involvement of the spinal elements. SINS has demonstrated clinically acceptable reliability among surgeons, radiation oncologists, and radiologists. The total SINS score can range from a score of 0 to 18. The total score has been divided into three categories of stability: stability (0-6), indeterminate instability (7-12), and instability (13-18). Surgical consultation is recommended for patients with SINS scores ≥ 7.</description>

    <measure>Euroqol EQ-5D-3L</measure>
    <time_frame>Every standard of care scheduled follow-up visit up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQOL group developed a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it contains 5 questions and provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by respondents and is ideally suited for use in mailed surveys, in clinics and face-to-face interviews. It is cognitively simple, taking only a few minutes to complete. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire.</description>

    <description>The Pain NRS is an 11-point horizontal scale where the end points are the extremes of no pain (0) and pain as bad as it could be, or worst pain (10). It measures subjective intensity of pain and the patient rates his/her overall or average daily pain.</description>

    <measure>Spine Oncology Study Group Outcome Questionnaire (SOSGOQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every standard of care scheduled follow-up visit up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a new HRQOL outcome tool which was developed specifically for metastatic spine tumor. It is currently available in English and Hungarian. It contains 56 concepts representing all four domains of the International Classification of Function and Disability. It is made up of five domains: physical function, neural function, pain, mental health and social function. It was developed as a comparison to the SF-36 for patients with spine tumors.</description>

    <description>The patient assessment includes seven questions which are to be answered by the patient to collect the following information:
smoking status, medication usage including, over the counter medication, muscle relaxants, narcotic pain medication, anti-depressants, and neuroleptics - agents to calm nerve pain.
In addition, the patient will be asked how optimistic he/she is about the future improvement of his/her spine condition.</description>

    <time_frame>Every standard of care scheduled follow-up visit up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Early complication data will be recorded for all surgically treated patients during the standard of care scheduled follow-up visits. Complications will be assessed by evaluating the patient's medical files from the time treatment was initiated until the day of follow-up. The Spine AdVerse Events Severity system, version 2 (SAVES V2) AE abstraction tool will be used to record the perioperative morbidity data.</description>
