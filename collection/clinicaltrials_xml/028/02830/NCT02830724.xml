  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      In a new cancer therapy, researchers take a person s blood, select a certain white blood
      cell to grow in the lab, and then change the genes of these cells using a virus. The cells
      are then given back to the person. This is called gene transfer. For this study, researchers
      will modify the person s white blood cells with anti-CD70.

      Objectives:

      To see if a gene transfer with anti-CD70 cells can safely shrink tumors and to be certain
      the treatment is safe.

      Eligibility:

      Adults age 18 and older diagnosed with cancer that has the CD70-expressing cancer.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, and other tests.
      They may by admitted to the hospital. Leukapheresis will be performed. For this, blood is
      removed through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the white blood cells. The rest of
      the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.

      Eligible participants will have an intravenous catheter placed in their upper chest. Over
      several days, they will get chemotherapy drugs and the anti-CD70 cells. They will recover in
      the hospital.

      Participants will take an antibiotic for 6 months after treatment. They will repeat
      leukapheresis.

      Participants will visit the clinic every 1-3 months for the first year after treatment,
      every 6 months for the second year, and then as determined by their physician. Follow-up
      visits will take 1-2 days. At each visit, participants will have lab tests, imaging studies,
      and a physical exam.

      Throughout the study, blood will be taken and participants will have many tests to determine
      the size and extent of their tumor and the treatment s impact.

      Background:

        -  We generated a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that engages CD70 using its natural
           ligand CD27, as the binding moiety. Transducing PBL with this CAR conveys
           MHC-independent recognition of CD70 expressing target cells, which include renal cell
           carcinoma and other cancers.

        -  In co-cultures with CD70+ target cells, anti-hCD70 CAR transduced T cells secrete
           significant amounts of IFN-gamma with high specificity.

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

        -  To determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with this anti-hCD70 CAR in
           concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2;
           aldesleukin).

        -  Determine if these anti-hCD70 CAR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression of CD70
           expressing tumors.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who have CD70 expressing tumors and 18 years of age or older must have:

      -Measurable metastatic disease that has progressed after standard therapy

      Patients may not have:

      -Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

      Design:

        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.

        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant
           containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-hCD70 CAR.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  On day 0 patients will receive their PBL transduced with the anti-hCD70 CAR and then
           begin high dose aldesleukin.

        -  A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted approximately 4-6 weeks
           after treatment.

        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design, with two separate
           cohorts for the Phase II component: 1) renal cell carcinoma and 2) non-renal cell
           cancers (solid tumors only)

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Measurable unresectable cancer expressing CD70 as assessed by immunohistochemistry of
             resected tissue (&gt; 2+ CD70 positive on &gt; 50% of cancer cells, or &gt;1+ CD70 positive on
             &gt;75% of cancer cells).

          2. Patients must have previously received at least one standard therapy for their cancer
             (if available) and have been either non-responders (progressive disease) or have
             recurred.

          3. Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and
             asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions &gt;1cm that have been treated with stereotactic
             radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to
             be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.

          4. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to 70 years of age.

          5. Willing to sign a durable power of attorney

          6. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign the Informed Consent
             Document

          7. Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1

          8. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time of

          9. Serology:

             -Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can
             have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental

             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

             -Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. If
             hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the presence
             of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

         10. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

         11. Hematology

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1000/mm(3) without the support of
                  filgrastim

               -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/dl

               -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl, except in patients with Gilbert
                  s Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.

         13. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients toxicities must have
             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo).
             Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks,
             as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          2. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          3. History of major organ autoimmune disease.

          4. Active systemic infections (e.g.: requiring anti-infective treatment), coagulation
             disorders or other major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or
             immune system, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive
             pulmonary disease.

          5. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          6. Concurrent systemic steroid therapy.

          7. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to cyclophosphamide or
