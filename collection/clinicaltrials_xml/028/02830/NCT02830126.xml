    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to implement an Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT). This pilot
      study will employ the existing information technology infrastructure at Barnes Jewish
      Hospital to create a remote monitoring and alerting system for the operating rooms. Similar
      to &quot;telemedicine&quot; methods employed in critical care, the ACT will support operating room
      clinicians in adhering to best-practice principles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will logically build on our previous work and utilize the already established
      infrastructure and resources of the intra-operative electronic medical record and the
      AlertWatch® alerting system. In conceptualizing this pilot study, as well as a larger
      follow-up trial focused on clinical outcomes, we have been mindful of challenges put forward
      to investigators by the National Institutes of Health, which seek to support low-cost,
      pragmatic, patient-centered randomized controlled trials.91 Specifically in relation to
      ACTFAST, (1) the highly developed, specialized IT infrastructure limits the investment
      required for embarking on this study; (2) the study will be conducted entirely within the
      context of routine clinical care, negating the need for dedicated trial-related visits; (3)
      access to registries with granular data on complications and patient-reported outcomes
      obviates the need for a new and costly infrastructure to track patient outcomes; (4)
      inclusion of large numbers of broadly representative patients in this study will be highly
      efficient with a waiver of informed consent.91 The design for this pilot proof-of-concept
      study will be a randomized clinical effectiveness trial. It will include a 6-month
      pre-intervention period during which time the ACT will be staffed but no alerts will be
      sent. This will allow for the training of controllers, refinement of alerts, and
      optimization of processes for obtaining and filtering information from diverse electronic
      sources. Following this period, the trial will begin and run for 12 months. On a daily basis
      during the study period (weekdays from 7am to 5pm), each operating room in Barnes-Jewish
      Hospital (BJH) will be eligible for randomization, which will occur using computer-generated
      assignment. Anesthesiology teams in ORs allocated to the experimental arm will receive the
      additional support of the ACT in the form of control-tower alerts that complement the
      AlertWatch® system. The outcomes of interest in this pilot study will be the usability and
      usefulness of the ACT, clinician adherence to recommendations for monitoring, documentation
      and therapeutic interventions, key physiologic variables such as temperature and blood
      pressure. We will also document patient outcomes including duration of postoperative
      hospital stay, incidence of postoperative morbidity (myocardial infarction, surgical site
      infection), functional recovery, and postoperative quality of life. Data on these endpoints
      will inform the design of a subsequent trial focused on clinically relevant outcomes, which
      will logically follow the current pilot randomized trial. All of the alerts included in this
      study will be chosen because they follow proven best intraoperative management practice and
      are in line with national metrics for quality and safety.

    <description>Usability and usefulness are key features of successful implementation of new information technologies 24,99,100. The success of the proof-of-concept ACT implementation and its perceived usefulness and usability depend on participation and support of the entire anesthetic team. Our usability testing procedure will explore the 5Es (effectiveness, efficiency, engagement, error tolerance, ease of learning) needed to develop a useful and usable resource.</description>
