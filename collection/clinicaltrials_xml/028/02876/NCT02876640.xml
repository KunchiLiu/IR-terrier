    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies how well retinoid 9cUAB30 works in producing a biologic effect
      in patients with early stage breast cancer. Chemoprevention is the use of drugs to keep
      breast cancer from forming or coming back. The use of retinoid 9cUAB30 may slow disease
      progression in patients with early stage breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare molecular analysis of pre- and post-treatment tissue samples of breast cancers of
      patients treated with 14-28 days of oral retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective retinoid
      9cUAB30 (9 c-UAB30) to demonstrate significantly reduced proliferation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if 14-28 days of oral RXR-selective 9c-UAB30 treatment increases apoptotic
      index, as measured by TUNEL assay.

      II. Examine the differences in gene expression from baseline to post-exposure breast cancer
      samples using a custom gene panel from Nanostring Technologies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive retinoid 9cUAB30 orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14 to 28 days. Patients
      then undergo tumor resection surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 days and 4-5 weeks.

    <description>The baseline, post-exposure, absolute change in Ki-67, and difference in absolute change between the treated and matched controls will all be summarized with descriptive statistics. The primary analysis will compare the difference in absolute change in Ki-67 between treatment and matched &quot;control&quot; group using a one-tailed paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, as appropriate, at a significance level of 0.05.</description>
