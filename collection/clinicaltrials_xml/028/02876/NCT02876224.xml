  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, two-stage, Phase Ib study designed to assess
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral cobimetinib with intravenous (IV)
      atezolizumab and bevacizumab in participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who
      have received and progressed on at least one prior line of therapy that contained a
      fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin or irinotecan. There are two stages in this study: Stage 1
      (safety run-in period) and Stage 2 (dose expansion with two cohorts, an expansion cohort and
      a biopsy cohort).

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Stage 1 Safety Run-in Period (SRP): Approximately 12 participants will receive cobimetinib 60 milligrams (mg) orally once daily for Days 1-21 with atezolizumab 840 mg and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg administered by IV infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Atezolizumab will be administered first, followed by bevacizumab, with a minimum of 30 minutes between dosing. Upon determination of the safety and tolerability of the treatment regimen, the study will proceed to the expansion stage. If the results from the safety run-in stage require dose reduction in cobimetinib, then an additional Stage 1 cohort will be opened. Treatment will continue until the participant has disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unacceptable toxicity, death, participant or physician decision to withdraw, or pregnancy, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Stage 2 Biopsy Cohort (BC): Approximately 7 evaluable participants in the biopsy cohort in expansion stage will start bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV infusion on Day 1 followed by a tumor biopsy on Day 14 and the start of cobimetinib (at dose determined during safety run-in period) orally on Day 15 followed by a tumor biopsy on Day 28 and the start of atezolizumab 840 mg IV infusion on Day 29 followed by an optional tumor biopsy on Day 56. Atezolizumab will be administered first, followed by bevacizumab, with a minimum of 30 minutes between dosing. Biopsies must be performed before the initiation of cobimetinib and atezolizumab respectively. Thereafter, participants in the biopsy cohort will follow same treatment regimen as those in the safety run-in and treatment expansion cohorts. Treatment will continue until participant has disease progression according to RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, death, the participant or physician decision to withdraw, or pregnancy, whichever occurs first.</description>

Atezolizumab will be administered first, followed by bevacizumab, with a minimum of 30 minutes between dosing. Treatment will continue until the participant has disease progression according to RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, death, participant or physician decision to withdraw, or pregnancy, whichever occurs first.</description>
