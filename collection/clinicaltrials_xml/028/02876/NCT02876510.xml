    <textblock>
      The ACTolog clinical trial IMA101-101 is a first-in-human trial for the ACTolog concept
      targeting patients with advanced stage solid cancers depending on the expression of ACTolog
      targets within their tumors. In the IMA101-101 trial, a patient's tumor is first biomarker
      tested for the expression of ACTolog targets (&quot;antigen warehouse&quot;). Only if the individual
      tumor is positive for at least one ACTolog target, the patient will be enrolled in the
      trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the IMA101-101 study patients with relapsed and/or refractory solid cancers will be
      treated with autologous CD8+ T-cell products (IMA101) specific for novel targets from the
      ACTolog warehouse that have been identified by the XPRESIDENT target discovery platform.

      During production of the autologous T-cell product the patients will receive a further line
      of established treatment. If this last established therapy option is no longer warranted
      (e.g. because of disease progression), IMA101 T-cell product will be administered to the
      patients after a lymphodepleting pre-conditioning with non-myeloablative chemotherapy
      (Flu/CY). Low-dose IL-2 is given thereafter for 14 days to enhance T-cell persistence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have pathologically confirmed advanced/metastatic cancer prior to
             enrollment.

          2. HLA phenotype HLA-A*02:01 prior to enrollment.

          3. Age: ≥18 years and ≤65 years (to select for patients with sufficient proliferative
             capacity of T cells).

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.

          5. Life expectancy &gt; 6 months prior to enrollment.

          6. Patient is a candidate for a maximum of one further line of established therapy
             (prior to treatment with ACTolog).

        Additional inclusion criteria as per protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any condition contraindicating leukapheresis.

          2. Patients with brain metastases.

          3. HIV infection, active Hepatitis B or C infection, or active infections requiring oral
             or intravenous antibiotics or that can cause a severe disease and pose a severe
             danger to lab personnel working on patients' blood or tissue. If positive test
             results are not indicative of an active infection, patients can be included.

          4. For the active therapeutic part of the protocol (treatment phase and treatment
             observation phase): concomitant therapy indicated with any of the following:
             interferons or other non-study immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy
             (lymphodepleting regimen according to protocol is allowed); immunosuppressive agents;
             other investigational therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (as long
             as steroid dose is significantly greater than what is required for physiologic
             replacement).

          5. Previous extensive radiotherapy to the lung or liver during the last 4 months prior
             to lymphodepletion regimen.

          6. The patient has cardiac conditions as follows: uncontrolled hypertension (BP &gt;
             150/100) despite optimal therapy, uncontrolled angina, ventricular arrhythmias,
             congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II or above), baseline
             LVEF ≤ 50%, prior or current cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation with heart rate &gt;100
             bpm, unstable ischemic heart disease (myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to
             starting treatment or angina requiring use of nitrates more than once weekly).

          7. Patients with prior stem cell transplantation or solid organ transplantation.

          8. The patient has concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease that could
             compromise participation in the study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, severe infection
             requiring active treatment, severe malnutrition, chronic severe liver or renal
             disease).

          9. Active diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, gastrointestinal obstruction,
             abdominal carcinomatosis or other known risk factors for bowel perforation.

         10. History of other malignancies (except for adequately treated basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma or carcinoma in situ) within the last 5 years.

         11. The patient is pregnant (confirmed by serum b-HCG, if applicable) or is
             breastfeeding.

         12. Serious autoimmune disease at the discretion of the treating attending: Patients with
             a history of active serious inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and
             ulcerative colitis) or autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic Lupus Erythematosus or autoimmune
             vasculitis [e.g. Wegener's Granulomatosis] are excluded from this study.

         13. History of hypersensitivity to cyclophosphamide, fludarabine or IL-2.

         14. Immunosuppression, not related to prior treatment for malignancy.

         15. History of or current immunodeficiency disease or prior treatment compromising immune
             function at the discretion of the treating physician.

         16. Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures.
