      The purpose of this registry is to evaluate the effect of BAROSTIM THERAPY with the BAROSTIM
      NEO system in the commercial setting in subjects recently implanted under the CE-Marked
      indication for resistant hypertension that also have evidence of heart failure with
      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

        The CVRx BAROSTIM THERAPY in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)
        Registry will be performed with subjects who have been recently implanted with the
        BAROSTIM NEO System in accordance with CE-Mark approved criteria for resistant
        hypertension and have evidence of HFpEF per the registry enrollment criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sign an Ethics Committee (EC) approved informed consent form for the registry.

          -  Implanted with the BAROSTIM NEO system in accordance with CE-Mark approved
             indications and contraindications for resistant hypertension within 30 days prior to
             enrollment.

          -  BAROSTIM THERAPY not yet chronically activated.

          -  Pre-implant echocardiogram with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50% within 30
             days prior to implant.

          -  On stable, maximally-tolerated, guideline-directed cardiovascular medications for at
             least 30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Objective evidence of heart failure according to the following criteria:

               -  Hospitalization for heart failure within 12 months prior to enrollment OR

               -  Echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction (LA Volume Index &gt;34 ml/m2
                  OR E/e &gt;13) within 30 days prior to enrollment OR

               -  NTproBNP &gt; 220 pg/mL or BNP &gt; 80 pg/mL (in atrial fibrillation, NTproBNP &gt; 600

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Heart failure secondary to a reversible or treatable condition such as, cardiac
             structural valvular disease, acute myocarditis and pericardial constriction.

          -  Heart failure secondary to right ventricular failure or right ventricular myocardial
             infarction.
