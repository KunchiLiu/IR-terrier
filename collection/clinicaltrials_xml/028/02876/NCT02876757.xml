  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2015, Health Canada issued a warning about a potential relationship between
      suicide and finasteride use and called for further research. No population based studies
      have assessed the risk of suicide with finasteride use, and this risk is not currently part
      of the product monograph. Furthermore, the link between depression and finasteride has not
      been well studied in the older population who are the primary users of this medication.

    <description>Ontario Registrar General Death database. Use the COD_primary variable (used from 2003 onwards) to define suicide, based on an ICD10 code of X60-X84.
NACRS: X60-84 (dx10code1-dx10code10) AND dead on arrival or death after arrival (visdisp2002 = 10 or 11). Consider admission date the date of the event.
OMHRS: Discharge reason (dischreason (X90) = 2). Died from suicide. Consider admission date the date of the event.
CIHI-DAD (Consider admission date the date of the event):
i. suicide=1, or ii. dx10code1-25= ICD10 X60-84 AND dischdisp=&quot;07&quot;.</description>
