    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without cediranib works in
      treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in
      the body. Olaparib and cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured
      by radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), as compared to olaparib monotherapy in
      patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured
      by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, radiographic response rate by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1, and overall survival (OS), as
      compared to olaparib monotherapy in patients with mCRPC.

      II. To evaluate association of homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair
      deficiency (HRD) with the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib or
      olaparib monotherapy, as measured by rPFS, in mCRPC patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize genomic alterations by whole exome sequencing in mCRPC patients and
      correlate that with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.

      II. To characterize changes in ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of DNA repair genes,
      angiogenesis markers, and immune markers, by whole transcriptome sequencing and correlate
      with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.

      III. To characterize changes in immune tumor microenvironment in mCRPC patients by profiling
      expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,
      and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.

      IV. To identify baseline predictive biomarkers for rPFS or response and to identify
      on-treatment markers of acquired resistance in men with mCRPC receiving either olaparib plus
      cediranib or olaparib alone.

      V. To explore biomarker signatures that correlate with the clinical activity or resistance
      to olaparib with or without cediranib, including changes in gene expression or acquired
      mutations in tumor biopsies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive olaparib PO BID and cediranib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.

          -  Patients may not have current dependency on intravenous (IV) hydration or total
             parenteral nutrition (TPN)

          -  Patients may not have evidence of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis; therapeutic
             anticoagulation for prior thromboembolic events is not permitted

          -  Patients with history of intra-abdominal bleeding or retroperitoneal bleeding within
             the last 3 years are excluded

          -  Patients may not have features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute
             myelogenous leukemia (AML) on peripheral blood smear or bone marrow biopsy, if
             clinically indicated

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             cediranib or olaparib; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated; HIV-positive patients with
             undetectable viral loads and CD4 counts &gt; 300, and not on any antiretroviral therapy
             may be allowed after discussing with the principal investigator
