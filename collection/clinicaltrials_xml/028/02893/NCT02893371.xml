    <textblock>
      The objective of this retrospective observational study is to compare commonly prescribed
      bipolar disorder medications for their impact on: (1) all-cause mortality; (2)
      hospitalization; (3) mood episodes; (4) suicide attempts and self-harm; and (5) risk of
      drug-induced adverse effects such as kidney disease/failure and metabolic syndrome. In
      addition, the investigators will examine heterogeneity of treatment effect by co-morbidity
      within pediatric, adult, and elderly sub-populations.

      Funded by PCORI, the objective of this retrospective observational study is to perform
      several safety and effectiveness comparisons on commonly prescribed bipolar disorder
      medications.

      The study will be a retrospective cohort study conducted with administrative claims data
      from the Truven MarketScan Commerical Claims and Encounters and Medicare database from
      2010-2016.

      The database contains approximately 100 million patients within the US population in every
      state and nearly every county in the nation, across all ages, ethnicities and socioeconomic
      categories, including privately insured, and Medicare patients. The study will focus on
      approximately 1 million patients with two or more diagnoses of bipolar disorder in the
      claims records according to ICD-9 and/or ICD-10 coding.

      The treatments that will be compared are: mood-stabilizers (1) lithium carbonate (Lithobid);
      the anticonvulsants (2) lamotrigine (Lamictal), (3) valproate (Depakote), (4) oxcarbazepine
      (Trileptal), and (5) carbamazepine (Equetro); and the atypical antipsychotics (5)
      ziprasidone (Geodon), (6) risperidone (Risperdal), (7) quetiapine (Seroquel), (8) olanzapine
      (Zyprexa), (9) aripiprazole (Abilify) and (10) the combination olanzapine/fluoxetine
      (Symbyax).

      The investigators will perform cross-sectional and survival based analysis using regression,
      propensity scoring, and local control to perform bias-corrected comparisons of the above
      treatments for for their impact on: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) risk of hospitalization;
      (3) frequency of manic and depressive mood episodes; (4) risk of suicide attempts and
      self-harm; and (5) risk of drug-induced adverse effects such as kidney disease/failure and
      metabolic syndrome. In addition, the investigators will examine heterogeneity of treatment
      effect by co-morbidity within pediatric, adult, and elderly sub-populations.
