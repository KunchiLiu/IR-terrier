      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the clinical efficacy of BI 695501 with
      EU-approved Humira® in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD).

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to compare the efficacy and safety of BI 695501
      with EU-approved Humira® across the induction and maintenance phases.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Males and females aged &gt;=18 and =&lt;80 years at Screening who have a diagnosis of
             moderate to severely active Crohn's Disease (CD), confirmed by endoscopy or
             radiologic evaluation, for more than 4 months with evidence of mucosal ulceration.
             Patients must have all of the following:

               -  Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of &gt;=220 and =&lt;450

               -  A diagnosis of Crohn's Disease (CD) confirmed by ileocolonoscopy during
                  Screening

               -  Endoscopic documentation of ulceration at Screening corresponding to a score of
                  2 or 3 in at least one of the five segments of the colon on the Ulcerated
                  Surface subscore of the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD)

          -  Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) naïve patients or patients previously treated with
             infliximab or any other anti TNF agent (except adalimumab) who had initially
             responded and who meet one of the following criteria:

               -  Responded and developed secondary resistance due confirmed anti-infliximab
                  anti-drug antibody formation, which caused infliximab depletion

               -  Responded and became intolerant

          -  Further inclusion criteria apply

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with an ostomy or ileoanal pouch

          -  Patients with short bowel syndrome

          -  Patients who have previously used infliximab and have never clinically responded

          -  Patients who have previously received treatment with adalimumab, or who have
             participated in an adalimumab or adalimumab biosimilar clinical trial, or are
             positive for anti-adalimumab antibodies at baseline
