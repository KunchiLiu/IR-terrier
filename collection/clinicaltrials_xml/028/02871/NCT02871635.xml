      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the clinical efficacy of BI 695501 with
      EU-approved Humira速 in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD).

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to compare the efficacy and safety of BI 695501
      with EU-approved Humira速 across the induction and maintenance phases.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Males and females aged &gt;=18 and =&lt;80 years at Screening who have a diagnosis of
             moderate to severely active Crohn's Disease (CD), confirmed by endoscopy or
             radiologic evaluation, for more than 4 months with evidence of mucosal ulceration.
             Patients must have all of the following:

               -  Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of &gt;=220 and =&lt;450

               -  A diagnosis of Crohn's Disease (CD) confirmed by ileocolonoscopy during
                  Screening

               -  Endoscopic documentation of ulceration at Screening corresponding to a score of
                  2 or 3 in at least one of the five segments of the colon on the Ulcerated
                  Surface subscore of the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD)

          -  Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) na誰ve patients or patients previously treated with

             responded and who meet one of the following criteria:

               -  Responded and developed secondary resistance due confirmed anti-infliximab
                  anti-drug antibody formation, which caused infliximab depletion

               -  Responded and became intolerant

          -  Further inclusion criteria apply

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with short bowel syndrome

          -  Patients who have previously used infliximab and have never clinically responded

          -  Patients who have previously received treatment with adalimumab, or who have
             participated in an adalimumab or adalimumab biosimilar clinical trial, or are
             positive for anti-adalimumab antibodies at baseline
