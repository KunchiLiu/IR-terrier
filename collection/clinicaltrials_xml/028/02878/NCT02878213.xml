  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate real-time gap detection using EPD D700 dielectric
      sensing compared with customary electrical isolation tests and Adenosine infusion at the end
      of the procedure. Furthermore, safety, usability and clinical applicability of the system
      for guided AF ablation will be confirmed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-center, non-randomized, non-blinded, open label, and single arm study.

      All procedures will be performed under CARTO-3 guidance for the treatment of atrial
      fibrillation (AF). The EPD D700 system will be used in-tandem, to record pre-, during and
      immediate post-ablation tissue characteristics and compute likelihood of lesion
      transmurality and permanency. Additionally, D700 system safety, feasibility, usability and
      clinical applicability will be documented.

      The entire procedure will be conducted as customary, using standard and approved
      off-the-shelf equipment (body surface electrodes, diagnostic and irrigated ablation
      catheters, RF generator and recording system), in a completely clinically independent manner
      from the EPD D700 system. The physician will neither use nor rely on any of the D700 system
      output for clinical decision making and will be blinded to the D700 lesion assessment
      forecasts. After 30 days following the initial procedure, a repeated procedure will be
      performed for gap detection and its results will be correlated with the D700 predictions.
