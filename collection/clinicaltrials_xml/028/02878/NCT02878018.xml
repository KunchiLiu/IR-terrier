  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis(HSPN) is one of the most common secondary
      glomerulonephritis in children.This is an important chronic disease endangering children's
      health.The main drugs in clinic are glucocorticoid,immunosuppressants and
      anticoagulation.Subject group concluded a series of prescriptions to treat children with
      purpura nephritis:Qijishenkang lotion,Zhubai lotion,More Kidney lotion.Prospective cohort
      study of clinical research methods are adopted.To develop clinical diagnosis and treatment
      scheme which can be widely used to treat children with purpura nephritis (Heat Toxin
      Injuring Collaterals Type,Damp Heat Injuring Collaterals Type,Qi Deficiency and Blood Stasis
      Syndrome).

      We will retain the blood of each patient to do some research of lncRNA with
      patients'permission.Try to find some relationship between lncRNA and HSPN disease.We also
      retain the urine and coated tongue to establish the biospecimen repository for our
      patients.When they grow up,these spicimens may help them to understand their bodies more
      correctly.
