    <textblock>
      The TopCSPN trial is a double blinded randomized placebo controlled study of oral topirmate
      as a potential disease altering therapy for cryptogenic sensory peripheral neuropathy
      (CSPN). Patients with CSPN who also have metabolic syndrome (defined by the ATPIII criteria)
      who do not have an alternative cause for neuropathy will be potentially eligible. The co
      primary outcome measures are change in the Norfolk Quality of Life - Diabetic Neuropathy
      (NQOL-DN) Scale and intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IEFND) at the distal thigh. The
      treatment phase will last 24 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Age 18-75

        Diagnosis of confirmed cryptogenic symptomatic distal symmetric peripheral polyneuropathy
        based on the Toronto consensus criteria for confirmed neuropathy.

        Metabolic syndrome based on the ATPIII criteria.

        No history of prior therapy with topiramate.

        If female of childbearing potential, willing to use an acceptable method of birth control
        for the duration of the study and for 3 months following completion of study drug therapy.
        Acceptable methods of birth control include oral or barrier methods.

        Negative serum pregnancy test at screening and negative urine pregnancy test at baseline
        visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any identified alternative cause for peripheral neuropathy. All potential participants
        will have screening neuropathy labs including assessment for diabetes (Hemoglobin A1c,
        oral glucose tolerance test), vitamin B12 level, and serum protein
        electrophoresis{England:2009cq}.

        Family history of a non-diabetic neuropathy in a first-degree relative.

        Severe or longstanding neuropathy: Utah Early Neuropathy Score &gt; 15 or history of foot
        ulceration or amputation.

        Current or planned therapeutic anticoagulation including coumadin or oral factor X or
        thrombin inhibitor therapy.

        Use of oral prednisone.

        Use of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (such as acetazolamide) due to risk of
        nephrolithiasis.

        Screening laboratory values above normal limits as follows: AST/ALT ≥1.5 times upper limit
        normal, creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dl.

        Severe edema, dermatologic or lower extremity condition that would increase risk of skin
        biopsy.

        A serious medical condition expected to dramatically shorten life span or prevent
        participation.

        Any clinically significant condition or illness, which, in the opinion of the
        investigator, would pose a risk to the participant or might confound the study.

        History of alcohol or drug abuse within one year of study enrollment.

        History of malignancy within five years prior to study enrollment, except for adequately
        treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer.

        An inability to understand or cooperate with the procedures of the study.

        Pregnant, or intending to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
