    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the
      statistical equivalence of efficacy, and to assess the safety of SAIT101 versus MabThera® in
      asymptomatic patients with LTBFL. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      study drug once a week for 4 weeks, and will then be followed up for up to 52 weeks after
      the first dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically-confirmed Low Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma, without
             B symptoms, Ann Arbor stage II to IVA NHL (CD20+ FL of Grades 1, 2, or 3a)

          2. Low tumor burden according to GELF criteria defined as:

             Normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or β2-microglobulin levels. No mass ≥7 cm.
             Less than 3 masses &gt;3 cm. No systemic or B symptoms (fever &gt;38°C for 3 consecutive
             days; recurrent, drenching night sweats; unintentional weight loss exceeding 10% body
             weight in the last 6 months.

             No splenomegaly ≥16 cm by CT scan. No risk of vital organ compression. No pleural or
             peritoneal serous effusion. No leukemic phase &gt;5,000/µL circulating tumor cells. No
             cytopenias (defined as platelets &lt;100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL, or absolute
             neutrophil count &lt;1,500/mm3).

          3. Patients not previously treated for their FL, including any previous treatment for FL
             under clinical trials except localized radiation therapy for previous limited stage
             disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment with any chemotherapy and/or rituximab or other monoclonal
             antibody.

          2. Prior radiotherapy completed &lt;28 days before study enrollment.

          3. Anticipated need for concomitant administration of any other experimental drug, or a
             concomitant chemotherapy, anticancer hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy
             during study participation.

          4. Concomitant disease which requires continuous therapy with corticosteroids at doses
             equivalent to prednisolone &gt;20 mg/day.

          5. Transformation to high-grade lymphoma secondary to previously untreated low-grade
             lymphoma.

          6. Prior or concomitant malignancies within 5 years prior to screening, with the
             exceptions of non-melanoma skin cancer, adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix, adequately treated breast cancer in situ, and localized prostate cancer stage
             T1c, provided that the patient underwent curative treatment and remains relapse free.

          7. Patients with a body surface area &gt;3.0 m2.

          8. Major surgery (excluding lymph node biopsy) within 28 days prior to randomization.

          9. Primary or secondary immunodeficiency (history of, or currently active), including
             known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive test at
             screening.

         10. Acute, severe infection (e.g., sepsis and opportunistic infections), or active,
             chronic or persistent infection that might worsen with immunosuppressive treatment
             (e.g., herpes zoster).

         11. Positive serological test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core
             antibody (HBcAb) or hepatitis C serology.

             Patients with a negative HBsAg and positive HBcAb must have a hepatitis B virus (HBV)
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level &lt;20 IU/mL (or 112 copies/mL) by polymerase chain
             reaction (PCR). These HBV patients must be willing to undergo PCR HBV DNA testing
             during treatment and may participate following consultation with a hepatitis expert
             regarding monitoring and use of HBV antiviral therapy, and provided they agree to
             receive treatment as indicated. An HBV re-test will be performed at each study visit
             from Week 5 onwards, and at the discretion of the Investigator.

             Patients with a positive test because of HBV vaccine may be included (i.e.,
             anti-HBs+, anti-HBc-).

             Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if PCR is
             negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).

         12. Confirmed current active tuberculosis (TB). Patients with latent TB as determined by
             positive QuantiFERON-TB test may be enrolled if such patients have written
             confirmation from their health care provider (e.g., Pulmonologist or Infection
             Specialist) of adequate prophylaxis before or within the screening period, and no
             evidence of tuberculosis on a chest X-ray performed within 3 months of Day 1.

         13. Central nervous system (CNS) or meningeal involvement, or cord compression by the
             lymphoma; history of CNS lymphoma. A brain scan should be conducted at screening ONLY
             if lesions are suspected on the brain, to exclude patients with brain localization of
             FL.

         14. History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylactic reaction to a biological agent
             or history of hypersensitivity to any component of the trial drug (e.g.,
             hypersensitivity or allergy to murine products).

         15. Patients who have significant cardiac disease, including but not limited to history
             of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III/IV; see Appendix
             7), unstable angina, or uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia.

         16. Uncontrolled or severe hypertension, or cerebrovascular disease.

         17. Serious underlying medical conditions that, per the Investigator's discretion, could
             impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial (including but not
             limited to ongoing active infection, severe immunosuppression, uncontrolled diabetes
             mellitus, gastric ulcers, or active autoimmune disease).

         18. Any other co-existing medical or psychological condition(s) that will preclude
             participation in the study or compromise ability to give informed consent and/or
             comply with study procedures.

         19. Treatment with any investigational medicinal product (IMP) within 4 weeks prior to
             initiation of 1st infusion of study drug, or treatment with a drug that has not
             received regulatory approval for any indication within 4 weeks or a minimum of 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer, of the 1st infusion of study drug.

         20. Receipt of a live/attenuated vaccine within 6 weeks prior to the screening visit.

         21. Females who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy during the treatment
             period or within 12 months after the last infusion of study drug.

         22. Patients who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct
             of the trial, and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by
             the investigator, or patients who are Archigen employees directly involved in the
             conduct of the trial.
