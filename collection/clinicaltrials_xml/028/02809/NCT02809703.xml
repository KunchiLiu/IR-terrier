      The objective of the study is to determine the quality of life of patients in the years
      following treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The study population
      will include all adults treated with any configuration of ECMO at Duke University Medical
      Center during the period of Jan 1, 2009 and Dec 31, 2015. Patient's will be contacted by
      direct mail, in conjunction with a surgeon who performed their ECMO procedure or managed
      them while on ECMO, and asked to complete a validated survey (WHOQOL-Bref) which assesses
      quality of life. In addition, patients will be asked to opt-in to participate in a phone
      survey in which they can give a narrative about their ICU experience and answer specific
      questions regarding long-term comorbidities. Data will be stored in a secure online server
      which is HIPAA compliant and analyzed by the department of anesthesiology statistical
      support services. De-identified data will be shared with the WHO as specified in their usage
      agreement.
