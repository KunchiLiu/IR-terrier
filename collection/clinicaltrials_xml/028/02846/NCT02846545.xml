    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be positive for at least 1 of the following diabetes-related autoantibodies obtained
             at study screening: Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-65), islet antigen 2 (IA-2),
             zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), Islet Cell Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies (ICA), or Insulin
             (if obtained within 10 days of the onset of exogenous insulin therapy)

          -  Have a peak stimulated C-peptide level greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 0.2 picomole per
             milliliter (pmol/mL) following a 4-hour Mixed-meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) obtained at
             study screening

          -  Be medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and vital
             signs performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, they must be consistent
             with the underlying illness in the study population

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at the
             Week 0 visit

          -  Participants (or their legally acceptable representatives) are willing and able to
             adhere to requirements, prohibitions, and restrictions specified in this protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a history of significant renal, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal,
             neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, or psychiatric disease or immune suppression
             or immune deficiency.

          -  Has significant cardiovascular disease, including history of myocardial infarction,
             congestive heart failure, angina, abnormal electrocardiogram or abnormal stress test

          -  Has active infections, is prone to infections or has chronic, recurrent or
             opportunistic infectious disease, including but not limited to, chronic renal
             infection, chronic chest infection (example [eg.], bronchiectasis), sinusitis,
             recurrent urinary tract infection (eg., recurrent pyelonephritis, chronic cystitis),
             Pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis, latent or active granulomatous infection,
             histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis or an open, draining, or infected non-healing
             skin wound or ulcer

          -  Has a clinically active infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or an EBV viral load
             &gt;=10,000 copies per 10^6 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) obtained at study
             screening. Has a clinically active infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or a CMV
             viral load &gt;= 10,000 copies per milliliter (mL) whole blood obtained at study
             screening

          -  Current or prior (within 30 days of screening) treatment that is known to cause a
             significant, ongoing change in the course of T1D or immunologic status, including
             high-dose inhaled, extensive topical, or systemic glucocorticoids

          -  Has other autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis [RA], polyarticular juvenile
             idiopathic arthritis [pJIA], psoriatic arthritis [PsA], ankylosing spondylitis [AS],
             multiple sclerosis [MS], systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) excluding clinically
             stable autoimmune thyroiditis whether treated or untreated

          -  Has any of the following tuberculosis [TB] screening criteria: A history of latent or
             active TB prior to screening (including but not limited to a positive QuantiFERON®-TB
             Gold test), signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or
             physical examination, recent close contact with a person with known or suspected
             active TB

          -  Has known allergies, intolerance and/or hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulin
             proteins, golimumab or any of its components or its excipients
