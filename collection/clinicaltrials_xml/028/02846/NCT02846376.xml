      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and benefit of nivolumab, ipilimumab or
      the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab given after bone marrow transplant for patients
      with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the safety of single-agent and combined checkpoint inhibition with nivolumab
           and ipilimumab in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome
           who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and are at high risk for
           post-transplant recurrence.

        -  Safety endpoint: The composite endpoint consisting of the occurrence of at least one
           treatment-related limiting toxicity (after checkpoint inhibitor treatment is initiated)
           defined as a ≥ grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity as specified by the CTCAE. Exceptions
           listed in section 5.9 apply to this endpoint as well. If 3 of 7 patients in a single
           cohort experience a treatment-related limiting toxicity, that single cohort will be
           terminated.

        -  Efficacy endpoint: To assess progression free survival at 12 and 18 months after
           initiation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia
           and myelodysplastic syndrome who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
           and are at high risk for post-transplant recurrence.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  Determine the toxicities resulting from administration of the treatments

        -  To assess blood immune reconstitution, phenotype and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire
           by sequencing to determine diversity and highest frequency clonal specificities: at
           screening for patients (at time of informed consent) and within 30 days before
           allogenic transplant conditioning; for donors, at apheresis (stem cell collection), and
           then serially for patients the day 1 of week 1 of checkpoint inhibitors and then weeks
           4, 7, 12, 18 and 26, and at 9, 12, 15, and 18 months post-transplant and at time of
           relapse if it occurs within 18 months of check point inhibitor initiation.

        -  To assess tumor site immune phenotype, TCR repertoire and Programmed death-ligand 1
           (PD-L1/2) expression when bone marrow biopsy is available prior to allogeneic
           transplantation conditioning and then at time of relapse within 18 months following
           initiation of check point inhibitor therapy.

        -  To assess complete response rate at 3, 6 and 12 months after autologous stem cell
           transplant (ASCT) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid
           leukemia (AML).

        -  To identify specific intestinal microbial strains associated with improved outcome in
           allogeneic stem cell transplantation patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors. The
           overall microbial composition in stool samples of patients will be analyzed at
           screening (up to 7 days post-consent), preconditioning (to be collected within 48 hours
           prior to transplant admission), at engraftment (within 48 hours of absolute neutrophil
           count (ANC) &gt; 500 on two sequential days), and then serially, on day 1 of week 1 (to be
           collected within 48 hours prior to clinic visit) and then weeks 4, 7, 12, 18, and 26
           and 9, 12, 15 and 18 months post-transplant, and at time of relapse, as it occurs.

When infusions of ipilimumab and nivolumab are given on the same day, the preferred treatment is to give nivolumab followed by ipilimumab. Separate infusion bags and filters must be used for each infusion. The nivolumab infusion must be promptly followed by a saline flush to clear the line of nivolumab before starting the ipilimumab infusion. The second infusion will always be ipilimumab, and will start approximately 30 minutes after completion of the nivolumab infusion.</description>

    <description>Nivolumab is a fully humanized immunoglobulin 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds to PD-1 (CD279) with nanomolar affinity and shows a high degree of specificity for PD-1; blocking binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and PD-L2. Nivolumab binds selectively to human PD-1 and does not bind to other members of the cluster of differentiation protein 28 (CD28) family.</description>
