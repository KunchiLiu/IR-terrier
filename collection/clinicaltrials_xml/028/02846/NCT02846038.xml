  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Honest, clear, and empathetic communication between pediatric oncologists (POs) and parents
      of children with cancer (POCCs) is imperative to facilitating therapeutic alliance and
      ensuring that medical management aligns with the families' goals of care. Communication is
      particularly important during conversations about disease reevaluation, which often
      necessitate parental decision-making in the context of emotional distress. POs employ a
      spectrum of communication styles and strategies during challenging conversations, and there
      is no consensus regarding linguistic or thematic metrics for high quality communication of
      upsetting information. In order to better understand how POs communicate difficult
      information to POCCs, the investigators propose a pilot study designed to accomplish the
      following primary aim:

      Primary Objective:

        -  To identify recurrent verbal and nonverbal (e.g. the use of pauses/silence)
           communication techniques employed by POs in the delivery of difficult prognostic
           information to POCCs through content analysis of audio-recorded conversations between
           POs and parents of children with high risk cancer at the time of disease reevaluation.

      The study expects to enroll up to: 30 patient participants, 30 parents, 6 primary pediatric
      oncologists, 30 non-primary oncologist care team members, 30 extended family members, and 30
      friends of the family (total = 156).

      Data collection will occur for a maximum of 2 surveys and a maximum of 3 interviews between
      the oncologist and the parent/patient. Disease reevaluation will be defined as any of the
      following interventions performed for the purposes of assessing disease status:

        -  Diagnostic imaging

        -  Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis

        -  Bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy

        -  Surgical biopsy or resection

      The first time point for data collection with be at the time of the patient's first meeting
      with their oncologist to discuss the results of disease reevaluation. This discussion will
      be audio-recorded. The parent will be asked to complete a survey within 7 days. Those
      receiving difficult news will have the opportunity to participate in a brief interview with
      a study team member regarding their experience. Patients who are at least 12 years old will
      also have this opportunity, separate from their parents, if desired by the patient and
      approved by the parent. Interviews may be in person or by phone and have no set length.

      The next time point for data collection will coincide with any time the patient/parents meet
      with their oncologist to discuss results of a disease reevaluation. Each conversation will
      be audio-recorded. If difficult news is delivered during the discussion, the parent (and
      patient, if desired) will be asked to complete a survey.

      All data analyzed from audio-recordings will be permanently erased from recorders following
      completion of data analysis. Participants may request to discontinue to the study at any
      time.
