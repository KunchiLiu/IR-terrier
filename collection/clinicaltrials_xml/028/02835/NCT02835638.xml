    <textblock>
      The main goal of this French multicenter observational cohort study is to prospectively
      collect data assessing the impact of the Adaptative Servo-Ventilation treatment on the
      quality of sleep of patients with central or combined sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) out of
      Heart Failure (HF) with altered ejection fraction, with a predominant central SAS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient over 18 years

          -  Naive patient to treatment with positive pressure with AHIc &gt; 15 requiring the
             establishment of an ASV to a central or combined SAS without any systolic HF (LVEF ≤
             45%) with predominant central SAS.

               -  OR Patient with a predominant obstructive SAS ( ≤ 50% central event ) whose
                  Continuous Positive Airway Pressure treatment (CPAP) does not allow adequate
                  control of the central events: treated for at least 1 month CPAP with a residual
                  central apnea hypopnea index greater than or equal to 10 events per hour (AHI
                  global&gt; 15, which AHIc ≥ 10) pressure to control obstructive events ( IAHo &lt;5 )
                  controlled by polygraphy or polysomnography with a pressure test &lt;10 cm H2O.

          -  Before inclusion, for patients who have previously been treated with CPAP, a PSG
             diagnosis will be made after a period of wash-out of CPAP of a 1-week period.

          -  Patient affiliated to the national social security (beneficiary or assignee ).

          -  Patient being aware of the information form and signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with against -indication for the use of ASV :

               -  History of massive epistaxis.

               -  Diseases related to barotrauma particularly pneumothorax and pneumo-
                  mediastinum.

               -  Suspicions of meningeal gaps or trauma history of the prior stage of the skull
                  base.

               -  Shortness of breath or hypercapnia deemed incompatible by the doctor with the
                  ASV treatment.

          -  Patients with predominant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (&gt; 85% obstructive events ).

          -  Standardized central SAS by the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of systolic heart failure (LVEF ≤45 %) with a predominant
             central SAS ( &gt; 50% central events ).

          -  Person deprived of liberty by judicial or administrative decision, person under a
             legal protection measure (pregnant or lactating women, patients under guardianship)

          -  Lack of signature for the information form and the informed consent form.
