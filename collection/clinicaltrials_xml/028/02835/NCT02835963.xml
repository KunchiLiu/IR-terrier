    <textblock>
      No studies have analyzed the predictive value of different anamnestic and clinical signs for
      the diagnosis of acute heart failure (AHF) in patients admitted to emergency department.
      That's why the expert group of the AHF of South West of France mobilizes to conduct this
      study to evaluate the diagnostic predictive value of different anamnestic and clinical signs
      for the diagnosis of AHF to emergencies.

      There is no recommendation of the French Society of Emergency Medicine (SFMU) on the
      management of the acute heart failure in the emergency department.

      The present study hypothesizes that identifying anamnestic and clinical criteria of AHF in
      patients admitted to emergency department for acute dyspnea would optimize the management of
      these patients upon arrival to the emergency department and to implement rapidly the
      appropriate therapeutic strategies.

      All patients admitted for dyspnea will be enrolled by the emergency physicians (after
      verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria) in the 3 participating centers.

      Then, all files will be analyzed retrospectively from information collected by a committee
      of experts cardiologists and emergency physicians of each center.

      The primary objective is the evaluation of diagnostic predictive value of different
      anamnestic and clinical signs for the diagnosis of AHF in emergency department for the
      construction of a clinical prediction score of acute heart failure. The secondary objective
      is the description of the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients admitted to the
      emergency for acute dyspnea.
