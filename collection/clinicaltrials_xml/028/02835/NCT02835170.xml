      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study on the efficacy,
      safety of intramuscular injections of autologous immunoglobulin in patients with
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (age ≥ 13 years) whose
      clinical conditions have not been effectively controlled by current standard medical
      therapies (topical moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors,
      and oral antihistamines) for more than 2 months will be include.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study on the efficacy,
      safety of intramuscular injections of autologous immunoglobulin in patients with
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. After providing informed consent, patients will be
      assessed for study eligibility at the baseline visit. Patients will undergo screening within
      28 days prior to randomization as &quot;wash out period&quot;, and during the screening period,
      treatment with medications (including systemic corticosteroids and systemic immunomodulating
      agents) for atopic dermatitis will be wash-out for at least 28 days prior to baseline
      (exclude moisturizers). Topical corticosteroid and topical calcineurin inhibitors will be
      required to stop at least the 7 consecutive days before the baseline.

      At screening, plasma will be separated from patients' venous blood (400ml) aseptically and
      autologous immunoglobulin fraction will be purified from the plasma by chromatography using
      Protein A during the screening period. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      weekly treatment with autologous immunoglobulin or placebo (normal saline) for 2 months will
      be administrated by intramuscular injection, once a week for 7 weeks (total 8 injections).

      The investigators will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of intramuscular injections
      of autologous immunoglobulin in those patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis by
      measuring changes in the standardized clinical severity scoring system for atopic dermatitis
      (SCORAD) values, Eczema Area and Severity index (EASI), Investigator's Global Assessment
      (IGA) and quality of life together with laboratory parameters in blood samples before and
      after treatment.
