  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized clinical trial, to determine whether dose-intensive tandem
      Consolidation, in a randomized comparison with single cycle Consolidation, provides an
      event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). The study population will be high-risk
      patients (non-Wnt and non-Shh sub-groups) with medulloblastoma, and for all patients with
      central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors completing &quot;Head Start 4&quot; Induction. This
      study will further determine whether the additional labor intensity (duration of
      hospitalizations and short-term and long-term morbidities) associated with the tandem
      treatment is justified by the improvement in outcome. It is expected that the tandem (3
      cycles) Consolidation regimen will produce a superior outcome compared to the single cycle
      Consolidation, given the substantially higher dose intensity of the tandem regimen, without
      significant addition of either short-term or long-term morbidities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the inferior response and event-free survival data of Regimens D and D2 on &quot;Head
      Start III&quot; for all children with supratentorial embryonal tumors, in comparison with the
      published data from &quot;Head Start II&quot; with Regimen A2 for metastatic patients, all such
      patients will receive the &quot;Head Start II&quot; Induction Regimen A2, on &quot;Head Start 4&quot;, for
      either three or five cycles, depending upon whether or not they achieve complete remission
      by the end of Induction cycle #3. They will then undergo randomization to either single
      cycle or three tandem cycles of Consolidation marrow-ablative chemotherapy with AuHPCR.

      Because of the unsatisfactory event-free survival for young children with
      non-desmoplastic/extensive nodular medulloblastoma (predominantly non-Shh and non-Wnt
      medulloblastoma subgroups) on Regimens D and D2 of &quot;Head Start III&quot;, all these patients will
      receive the &quot;Head Start II&quot; Induction Regimen A2 on &quot;&quot;Head Start 4&quot;&quot;, for either three or
      five cycles, depending upon whether or not they achieve complete remission by the end of
      Induction cycle #3. They will then undergo randomization to either single cycle or three
      tandem cycles of Consolidation marrow-ablative chemotherapy with AuHPCR.

      Because of the excellent event-free and overall survival for young children with good risk
      medullo-blastoma (Shh or Wnt subgroups) treated with up-front &quot;Head Start&quot; chemotherapy
      strategies, such patients will undergo risk-tailored reduction of duration of Induction
      therapy from five cycles to three cycles of the &quot;Head Start II&quot; Induction Regimen A2 on
      &quot;Head Start 4&quot; for patients achieving a complete response to 3 cycles, followed, provided
      they are also without evidence of residual tumor following recovery from Induction cycle #3.
      They will NOT then undergo randomization, but will follow with a single cycle of
      Consolidation marrow-ablative chemotherapy as in &quot;Head Start&quot; studies.

    <description>The 5 chemotherapy drugs used in the Induction part of treatment are vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and high-dose methotrexate.
Three medications are also given to help reduce the side effects of the chemotherapy drugs. Filgrastim will be given through a vein or through a tiny needle into the tissue just under the skin to help blood counts recover after the chemotherapy. Mesna will be given through a vein with cyclophosphamide to help prevent bleeding in the bladder. Leucovorin will be given through a vein after the methotrexate to protect the body from the side effects of the methotrexate.</description>
