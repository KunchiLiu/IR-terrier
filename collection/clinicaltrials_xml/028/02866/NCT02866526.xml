  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe haemophilia is a rare disease characterized by spontaneous bleedings from early
      childhood, which may lead to various complications especially in joints. Due to advances in
      medical care and more specifically in the development of prophylactic strategies by the
      application of clotting factor concentrates, life expectancy of persons with severe
      haemophilia has significantly increased over the last decades. This progress requires a
      long-term follow-up, including into adulthood. The adherence to a regular clinical follow-up
      and to a prophylactic treatment then depends on how successful patients' transition from
      childhood to adulthood has been as this process involves a transfer of responsibility from
      parents to patients concerning the management of their health. Beyond the issue of patients'
      adherence, a suboptimal transition may also impair quality of life and the entry into
      adulthood, especially at the social, emotional and professional levels. Only a few studies
      have been conducted to identify the specific needs and difficulties young persons with
      severe haemophilia experience during their transition from childhood to adulthood, and none
      of these studies has been carried out in France where the features of the health care system
      are very specific.

      Therefore, this study aims to address the issue of transition into adulthood among young
      persons with severe haemophilia in France. This study will focus not only on the
      facilitators and barriers of the access to health care but also, from a more global
      perspective, on all the specific concerns and difficulties they may experience as they grow
      into adulthood which may impair their long-term health related quality of life as well as
      their personal empowerment. This study will also allow to identify some of the socio-
      cognitive, emotional, and familial determinants of a good transition into adulthood.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of psychosocial and
      organisational factors on the quality of the transition into adulthood among young persons
      with severe haemophilia, measured by the adherence to their clinical follow-up and to their
      prophylactic treatment.

      The secondary objectives of this study are: (i) to identify the factors which facilitate or
      impair the transition into adulthood (socio-economic and demographic, psychosocial and
      cognitive, quality of life, clinical, organizational, therapeutic patient education), (ii)
      to assess specific factors involved in suboptimal transition process, by comparing a group
      of adolescents to a group of young adults, (iii) to assess the temporal evolution of these
      factors, (iv) to identify groups of patients (clusters) with specific profiles, and (v) to
      examine how young patients' expectations towards the health care system change during the
      transition into adulthood, to assess to what extent the current organization satisfies those
      expectations and promotes patients' acquisition of autonomy concerning their health, and to
      identify some ways to eventually improve that follow-up.

      This study is an exploratory, observational, multicentric, transversal study aimed at
      describing the perceptions of adolescents (14-17 years old) with severe haemophilia to those
      of young adults (20-29 years old) regarding their expectations and their feelings about
      growing into adulthood. Every patient enrolled in the FranceCoag national cohort (cohort of
      French patients suffering from inherited deficiencies of coagulation proteins), suffering
      from severe haemophilia, aged from 14 to 17 years old or from 20 to 29 years old, will be
      offered to get enrolled in the TRANSHEMO study (expected number of participants: 160
      adolescents and 407 young adults). The patients' participation in this study will not modify
      their medical or paramedical care. A multifocal approach which combines both quantitative
      and qualitative data collection will be proposed.
