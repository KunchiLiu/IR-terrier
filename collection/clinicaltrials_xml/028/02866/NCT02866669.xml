      The central objective of this proposal is to rigorously compare two strategies designed to
      improve BP control in primary care practices serving rural Southeastern African Americans
      with low socioeconomic status (SES) living in the &quot;Black Belt&quot;.

      The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Disparities Report identifies
      individuals with rural residence, minority ethnicity, and low SES as being at high risk for
      poor health outcomes. The &quot;Black Belt&quot; region stretches from eastern Texas in an arc to
      Maryland and includes residents with all 3 of these characteristics - the proverbial triple
      threat. This traditionally agricultural region is characterized by steep poverty, low
      educational attainment, scarce resources, and mostly African American residents. The Black
      Belt is in the heart of the Stroke Belt, a geographic area long recognized to have the
      highest cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the US. The AHRQ Disparities Report also
      cites that the Southeast has lower quality of care than the rest of the US, thus effective
      strategies to optimize CVD prevention in general and hypertension (HTN) control specifically
      are urgently needed here.

      In year 1 (AIM 1) we're engaging community members (community members who have experience
      being community peer advisors or have high blood pressure) to develop the study
      interventions and protocols. In years 2-5, the investigators will test these interventions.

    <description>Practices in the usual enhanced care arm will receive a blood pressure medication algorithm developed using national guidelines and content experts on our study team. Practices will be provided the Joint National Committee (JNC) recommended protocol to measuring blood pressures. Practices will receive a laptop workstation that has access to a patient education system - an online education video system. This system is being developed.</description>

Practice facilitation is a highly customized, staged approach to helping a practice to implement process and structural changes to enhance the quality of care and improve patient and staff satisfaction</description>
