    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized single blind safety and efficacy study of TOL-463,
      administered to female adults to treat vaginitis. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (1:1) to dose TOL-463 Gel or TOL-463 Insert. Study medication will be administered
      vaginally, once nightly for seven days. The duration of the study for each participant will
      be approximately 21-30 days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants eligible to participate in this study must meet criteria 1 or 2 or both and
        all of the remaining inclusion criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis based on the presence of all four Amsel criteria.*

             *Homogeneous vaginal discharge (off white, milky or gray, thin), positive KOH whiff
             test, vaginal secretions pH of &gt; 4.5, clue cells &gt; /= 20 percent of vaginal squamous
             epithelial cells on saline &quot;wet mount&quot;

          2. Diagnosis of VVC based on the presence of pseudohyphae on KOH preparation; must also
             have at least one sign and one symptom*, each rated based on severity** with minimum
             composite score of 2.

             *Signs include vulvovaginal edema, erythema, and/or excoriation. Symptoms include
             vulvovaginal itching, burning, and/or irritation.

             **Severity will be graded on a scale of 0-3 (absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2;
             severe = 3).

          3. Participant is willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          4. Participant is 18-50 years of age.

          5. Participant is in general good health based on medical history, physical examination,

             of study treatment.

             *Non-childbearing potential is defined as being post-menopausal for at least 1 year,
             status after bilateral tubal ligation for at least 1 year, or status after bilateral
             oophorectomy or status after hysterectomy.

             **Acceptable methods of birth control include use of hormonal contraceptives or

             that might confuse interpretation of response to study product.

             *Examples of such conditions include erosive lichen planus, desquamative interstitial
             vaginitis, or contact dermatitis involving the vulvar epithelium.

          2. Presence of T. vaginalis on wet mount or evidence of other infectious cause of
             cervicitis or vaginitis on physical examination.

          3. Active genital lesions, including ulcers, vesicles consistent with herpes, or warts.

          4. Use of metronidazole or other 5-nitro-imidazole derivative or clindamycin or an
             antifungal agent (intravaginal or systemic) for the treatment of any condition within
             14 days of start of study.

          5. Planned ongoing immunosuppressive therapy or systemic antibiotic treatment during the
             course of the study.

          6. Use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening.
