      STUDY SYNOPSIS Objectives The primary objective is to estimate the proportion of subjects
      who report clinically important reductions in pain score (defined as 2 points on a 0-10
      verbal numerical rating scale) after receiving fentanyl (50mcg) with or without intranasal
      (IN) ketamine (50mg) prior to hospital arrival for the treatment of acute traumatic pain.

      Design and Outcomes This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled single-site
      clinical trial. The primary outcome variable is reduction of reported pain of at least 2
      points (on the 0-10 Verbal Numerical Rating Scale1,2) when comparing the pretreatment pain
      score to the pain score obtained upon reassessment 30 minutes after medication
      administration. Secondary outcomes include: reduction of reported pain at Emergency
      Department (ED) arrival; the incidence of adverse events; additional opiate requirements
      prior to ED arrival and in the first three hours of ED care; development of chronic pain
      (measured by the Brief Pain Inventory,3) or post-traumatic stress disorder (measured by the
      PTSD Checklist for DSM-54) and overall satisfaction with life (measured by the Satisfaction
      With Life Scale5) at 90-days after injury.

      Interventions and Duration Adults who qualify for prehospital pain treatment under paramedic
      standing orders will be screened for inclusion and, if eligible, will undergo an
      IRB-approved consent process concurrent with receiving 50mcg fentanyl (IV or IN per current
      standard practice). Consenting subjects will be 1:1 randomized to receive either 50mg IN
      ketamine or IN placebo. Pain will be rated on a 0-10 scale by the subject prior to
      treatment, at 30 minutes following treatment, at ED arrival, and at 30 minute intervals for
      the first three hours of their ED care. Additional pain medications given prior to hospital
      arrival and within the first three hours of ED care will also be recorded. The primary
      outcome will be reduction in baseline pain between the pretreatment measurement and 30
      minutes after medication administration. Overall satisfaction with life and symptoms of PTSD
      and chronic pain will be assessed before hospital disposition (in-person) and via phone
      follow-up at 90-days (+/- 14 days) after injury.

      Sample size and Power The Investigators consider a two point reduction in pain to be
      clinically significant, and thus will compare the proportion of subjects achieving a two
      point reduction in pain at 30 minutes post-medication administration between the treatment
      group and the control group. Sample size considerations are based on this primary analysis.
      To test the hypothesis that the proportion of those treated with fentanyl alone that have at
      least a 2 point reduction in their pain will be lower than the proportion of those treated
      with the combination of fentanyl and single-dose ketamine who have a 2 point reduction in
      their pain, the investigators will use a chi-square test (or the Fisher's Exact Test if
      appropriate). An intent to treat approach will be used. It is expected the response rate in
      the two groups will be 40% and 60%, respectively. These estimates are based on the response
      rates in a study comparing pain management efficacy between subjects treated with morphine
      alone and morphine plus ketamine. With this magnitude of effect, a sample size of 97 per
      group will have 80% power to detect the difference between the two groups when the critical
      level of significance is set to 5%. To allow for subject drop-out, protocol deviations, and
      missing outcome data, the investigators plan to enroll an additional 15% in each arm, for a
      total of 224 subjects.
