      This phase II trial studies the side effects of durvalumab and tremelimumab and to see how
      well they work with or without high or low-dose radiation therapy in treating patients with
      colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may interfere with the ability
      of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor
      cells and shrink tumors. Giving durvalumab and tremelimumab with radiation therapy may work
      better in treating patients with colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety and tolerability of combined checkpoint blockade with durvalumab and
      tremelimumab alone or with high or low-dose radiation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      (NSCLC Cohort) II. To compare the overall response (excluding the irradiated lesion[s])
      between combined checkpoint blockade with durvalumab and tremelimumab alone or combined
      checkpoint blockade with low or high dose radiation. (NSCLC Cohort) III. To assess safety
      and tolerability of combined checkpoint blockade with durvalumab and tremelimumab with high
      or low-dose radiation. (Colorectal Cohort) IV. To determine the overall response rate
      (excluding the irradiated lesion[s]) with combined checkpoint blockade with durvalumab and
      tremelimumab with either low or high dose radiation. (Colorectal Cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate median progression-free survival and overall survival. (NSCLC Cohort) II. To
      determine local control within the irradiated field(s) and abscopal response rates. (NSCLC
      Cohort) III. To evaluate associations between PD-L1 expression as well as levels of
      infiltrating CD3+, CD8+ T-cells and overall response. (NSCLC Cohort) IV. To explore changes
      in PD-L1 expression, circulating T-cell populations, T-cell infiltration, ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) expression, spatial relationship of immune markers, and mutational burden as a result
      of low or high dose radiation. (NSCLC Cohort) V. To estimate median progression-free
      survival and overall survival. (Colorectal Cohort) VI. To determine local control within the
      irradiated field and abscopal response rates. (Colorectal Cohort) VII. To evaluate
      associations between PD-L1 expression as well as levels of infiltrating CD3+ CD8+ T-cells
      and overall response. (Colorectal Cohort) VIII. To evaluate changes between PD-L1 expression
      as well as levels of infiltrating CD3+, CD8+ T-cells induced by targeted low or high dose
      radiation. (Colorectal Cohort) IX. To explore changes in circulating T-cell populations,
      T-cell infiltration, RNA expression, spatial relationship of immune markers, and mutational
      burden as a result of low or high dose radiation.

      OUTLINE: Patients with NSCLC are randomized to Arm A, B, or C. Patients with colorectal
      cancer are randomized to Arm B or C.

      COHORT 1: Patients with NSCLC are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes
      every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients then receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes 4 weeks after last combination
      dose for up to 9 additional doses.

      ARM B: Patients receive tremelimumab and durvalumab and as in Arm A. Beginning at week 2,
      patients receive high dose radiation therapy once per day (QD) over 10 days for up to 3
      fractions.

      ARM C: Patients receive tremelimumab and durvalumab and as in Arm A. Beginning at week 2,
      patients receive low dose radiation therapy every 6 hours twice per day (BID) on weeks 2, 6,
      10 and 14.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 12 weeks.

             durvalumab or other PD-1 or PD-L1 directed therapy that led to drug discontinuation

          -  Prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy, except for anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy
             in NSCLC patients; this includes anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2
             antibodies, excluding therapeutic anticancer vaccines; exposure to other
             investigational agents may be permitted after discussion with the study principle
             investigator (PI)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because durvalumab, tremelimumab are
             immune checkpoint inhibitors with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects, as is radiation therapy; because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             durvalumab, tremelimumab and radiation, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with durvalumab, tremelimumab and radiation

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are ineligible due to the risks
             associated with immune checkpoint blockade; appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Any concurrent chemotherapy, immune therapy, biologic, hormonal therapy for cancer
             treatment

          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of their assigned IP; the following are exceptions to this criterion:

               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (eg,
                  intra-articular injection)

               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of
                  prednisone or its equivalent

               -  Steroids as pre-medication for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, CT scan
                  pre-medication)

          -  History of allogeneic organ transplantation

          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including
             inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis with the exception of a prior episode that
             has resolved or diverticulosis, celiac disease, or other serious gastrointestinal
             [GI] chronic conditions associated with diarrhea; systemic lupus erythematosus;
             Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis]; myasthenia gravis; Graves'
             disease; rheumatoid arthritis; hypophysitis; uveitis, etc.) within the past 3 years
             prior to the start of treatment; the following are exceptions to this criterion:

               -  Patients with vitiligo or alopecia

               -  Patients with hypothyroidism (eg, following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on
                  hormone replacement or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment

          -  History of another primary malignancy except for

               -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease &gt;= 5
                  years before the first dose of study drug and of low potential risk for
                  recurrence

               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease

               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease (eg, cervical
                  cancer in situ)

          -  Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) &gt;= 470 ms calculated from 3
             electrocardiograms (ECGs) using Fridericia's Correction

          -  History of active primary immunodeficiency

          -  Known history of previous clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis

          -  Active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV)

          -  Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of
             investigational treatment; Note: patients, if enrolled, should not receive live
             vaccine during the study and up to 30 days after the last dose of investigational
             treatment

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of the investigational treatment or interpretation of patient safety or
             study results

          -  Cohort 1 (NSCLC cohort)

               -  Eligibility for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents targeting the
                  EGFR or ALK pathway; exceptions to this requirement may be considered on a
                  case-by-case basis by the principal investigator if the patient was previously
                  treated with another targeted agent
