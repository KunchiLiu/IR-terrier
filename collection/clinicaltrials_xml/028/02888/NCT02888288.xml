  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if implementing an adapted Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus (HIV) curriculum plus mental health intervention versus HIV curriculum alone is
      acceptable and feasible and if it improves mental health, antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      adherence, and virologic outcomes among HIV-positive adolescents. HIV curriculum will
      continue to take place prior to the start of the monthly Saturday youth clinic. Mental
      health intervention sessions will take place three times a month for four months in groups
      of eight based on age and gender. Caregivers will attend two sessions to support the youth
      and provide the guardian perspective on caring for HIV-positive adolescents. The
      investigator hypothesizes the mental health intervention will be acceptable, feasible, and
      will improve mental health and ART adherence among participating youth and this improvement
      will be sustained over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 100 participants from the established Kilimanjaro Christian Medical
      Centre and Mawenzi Saturday Teen Clinics. Participants will be assigned to eight persons per
      group, based on age and gender. Groups will be matched in pairs as closely as possible (ex.
      two groups of females 12-16 years of age) and assigned to Wave 1, 2, or 3. Randomization
      will occur just before the start of mental health intervention for each wave. Matched groups
      will be randomized at this time point to reduce potential drop out of those with delayed
      start (Wave 2/3). Randomization will occur by a coin flip for the matched groups: heads will
      be intervention group (I) and tails the standard of care group (SOC).

      This feasibility study is longitudinal with up to 24 month follow-up after intervention.
      Feasibility measures from lay counselors will be monitored weekly. Outcome measures will be
      obtained by blinded interviewers using a structured survey to inquire about mental health
      symptoms, self-report adherence, obtain an ART drug concentration level from a hair sample,
      and HIV-1 viral load from a blood sample will be collected by the same research assistants
      at six potential time points: 1) baseline, 2) pre-intervention, 3) post-intervention, 4)
      6-months post-intervention, 5) 12-months post-intervention and 6) 24-months
      post-intervention.

    <description>This arm was designed based on mental health needs of HIV-infected youth in Tanzania. It incorporates principles of cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and motivational interviewing built into 10 group sessions, approximately 90 minutes each (2 sessions with caregiver participation) and 2 individual sessions. Groups are age and gender matched and facilitated by lay counselors with a mix of lived experience and prior mental health research experience.</description>

    <description>Includes a standard format of greetings, review of last session content, homework discussion, new topic, assigning homework and ends with a fun activity, relaxation or game. First session is a joint session with youth and caregivers. Topics include common stresses and worries experienced by HIV+ youth; relaxation and coping techniques; cognitive behavioral triangle; story of finding out HIV status and if willing, to discuss this in an individual session, peer group session, and with caregiver; identify circles of support; discuss stigma and how to disclose HIV status to others; consider values, hopes and dreams for the future, and how to use this information to live positively with HIV. ART adherence is woven into case examples and discussions.</description>
