      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Microlens Array
      Device for Skin Rejuvenation. This study is a single-center prospective, open-label
      uncontrolled pilot study. Subjects will receive up to 7 laser treatments, spaced 1 to 8
      weeks apart, and will be followed at 2 weeks (±1 week) post-first treatment and 12 weeks (±2
      weeks) post-final treatment. In addition, after each treatment, subjects will complete a 3
      day post treatment phone follow-up. At the Investigator's discretion, optional follow-up
      visits may also be conducted at 24 weeks post-final treatment (±2 weeks).
