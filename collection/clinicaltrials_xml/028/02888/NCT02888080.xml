        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects ages 18 to 80 years of age (both inclusive)

          -  Pulmonary sarcoidosis disease duration of ≥1 year

          -  Evidence of biopsy-proven, clinically active disease defined by having all of the
             following criteria:

               1. MMRC dyspnea scale ≥1

               2. Threshold FVC 50 - 80% of predicted

               3. Evidence of parenchymal lung involvement by HRCT

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treated pulmonary hypertension

          -  Previous exposure to concomitant treatment within according to the following
             criteria:

               1. Prednisone &gt;15 mg/day or changes in prednisone dose in the 8 weeks prior to
                  screening

               2. More than one immune-modulator (i.e., methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide,
                  hydroxychloroquine) or changes in their dosing levels within 12 weeks of
                  randomization.

               3. Mycophenolate use within 12 weeks of randomization

          -  Prior treatment with any biologic drug targeting the immune system within 180 days of
             randomization or history of any previous use of rituximab

             heart, eye and renal disease with significant hypercalcemia)

          -  Any conditions or significant medical problems which in the opinion of the
             investigator immune-compromise the patient and/or places the patient at unacceptable
             risk for immunomodulatory therapy, such as:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;LLN (1,500/μl)

                  viral infection

               4. Presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B or
                  hepatitis C infections based on screening lab results

               5. Presence of active or latent tuberculosis (TB) established during screening

               6. Clinical evidence or history of multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating

          -  Live vaccinations within 3 months prior to the start of the trial

          -  Current severe progressive or uncontrolled disease which in the judgment of the
             clinical investigator renders the patient unsuitable for the trial

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using methods of contraception defined in the
             protocol for the study.
