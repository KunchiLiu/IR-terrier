    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2a study is to assess changes in tear volume by the non-invasive
      techniques Ultra High Resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (UHR-OCT) following the
      administration of P-321 Ophthalmic Solution or Placebo in subjects with tear deficient dry
      eye disease.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, cross-over placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      changes in tear volume by P-321 Ophthalmic Solution and Placebo. The study will enroll
      subjects with tear deficient dry eye disease to receive sequentially one of two treatment
      sequences: P-321 Ophthalmic Solution then Placebo or Placebo then P-321. The study will
      consist of two Phases: In each Phase, subjects will be treated with a different strength of
      P-321 Ophthalmic Solution under the same study design.

      Approximately twenty-four eligible subjects will complete the study with approximately 8
      subjects participating in Phase 1 and the remainder of the 24 subjects participating in the
      phase 2. Decisions on the dose to be used in Phase 2 will be made based on Phase 1 data.

      The study will consist of three study visits: a Screening Visit (Visit 1), and two treatment
      visits (Visit 2 and Visit 3). The primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed at
      each treatment visit. Safety assessments include adverse events (AEs).
