          -  Subjects must have histologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic solid
             cancers of the following histological types:

                  mesothelioma

               2. epithelial ovarian cancer (fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers are
                  eligible)

               3. adenocarcinoma of the pancreas,

               4. triple-negative adenocarcinoma of the breast

               5. non-small-cell adenocarcinoma of the lung

          -  Subjects must have positive mesothelin expression in the archival tumor tissue,
             defined as the membrane intensity score of 1+, 2+ or 3+ (on the 0-3 scale) expressed
             on the membrane of ≥5% of tumor cells combined

          -  Subjects must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks
