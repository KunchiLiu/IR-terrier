      Study investigators will develop a biomarker-based EN decision rule for post-operative
      infants with CHD. Investigators lack objective data to inform decisions regarding provision
      of EN, an area where subjective decision-making is currently the rule. Lack of standardized
      practices for post-operative feeding lead to EN practice variation, which may harm these
      infants with regard to septic morbidity and long-term neurocognitive outcomes. Study
      investigators will address gaps in knowledge regarding the emerging role of the
      gastrointestinal tract as a modulator of SIRS, sepsis, and organ dysfunction after CPB
      during childhood. Finally, this proposal will inform the design of future studies to provide
      individualized, safe EN support, targeted to intestinal EBF. This proposal presents several
      innovations. First, the investigators will explore the gastrointestinal tract as a way to
      improve post-operative outcomes after surgical repair of CHD in infants. Second, the
      investigators will develop a feeding intolerance scale for use in future studies of EN
      titration in infants with CHD. Third, this proposal prospectively evaluates biomarkers of
      intestinal EBF in infants with CHD, a major advance in biomarker development in this field.

      Congenital Cardiac Defects in the United States Approximately 40,000 infants are born each
      year in the United States with congenital heart defects (CHD), and heart defects are the
      leading cause of birth defect-related deaths in the United States. While advances in
      surgical treatment, cardiac bypass, and post-operative management have improved mortality
      for children born with heart defects, these children continue to have significant morbidity
      related to post-operative malnutrition, multiple organ dysfunction (MODS), and sepsis. One
      proposed mechanism for post-operative sepsis and MODS is via loss of intestinal epithelial
      barrier function (EBF).

      Malnutrition Worsens Surgical Outcomes After Repair of CHD Despite clear evidence that
      post-operative malnutrition worsens surgical outcomes for infants with CHD, almost two
      thirds of these patients do not receive recommended calorie or protein requirements over the
      first 7 post-operative days. As even brief periods of malnutrition in infancy have permanent
      negative effects on neurocognitive outcome, enteral nutrition (EN) withheld post-operatively
      may worsen long-term neurocognitive outcome for infants with CHD. Strategies to improve safe
      delivery of early EN, by monitoring intestinal epithelial health to detect early intestinal
      hypoperfusion, could improve both short-term operative and long-term neurocognitive
      outcomes.

      Improved Delivery of Enteral Nutrition May Prevent Post-Operative Organ Dysfunction and
      Sepsis Loss of intestinal EBF is linked to the pathophysiology of sepsis and MODS in murine
      models of ischemia-reperfusion injury and in critically ill adults after cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB). Intestinal enterocytes, or epithelial cells, and the apical tight junction
      complex, which connect these cells are the primary determinants of intestinal barrier
      function. The absence of EN results in impaired intestinal EBF in humans and animals, with
      loss of enterocyte integrity and increased paracellular permeability via apical tight
      junctions, leading to translocation of bacteria and bacterial products into the blood
      stream. When low dose EN is delivered in mice with ischemia-reperfusion injury intestinal
      barrier architecture, function, and downstream signaling are preserved and/or restored in a
      dose-response relationship. Delays in EN delivery may impact patient outcomes through
      effects on nutritional status and through the downstream negative effects of intestinal
      epithelial barrier dysfunction. Study investigators do not understand the extent to which
      post-operative ischemia-reperfusion injury after repair of left sided congenital cardiac
      defects interacts with hemodynamic, respiratory, and nutritional support to alter recovery
      of intestinal EBF. Further studies are needed to understand if intestinal EBF profile can be
      used to assess post-operative readiness for EN in infants with CHD, and if improvement of
      intestinal EBF will reduce post-operative sepsis and MODS. Plasma biomarkers of key elements
      of intestinal EBF (enterocyte integrity, turnover, functional enterocyte mass, and
      paracellular tight junction function) exist and are clinical relevant, but have not been
      systematically studied in children with CHD.

      PRELIMINARY DATA Intestinal Barrier Function in Children after Cardiopulmonary Bypass. In a
      single center pilot study, Dr. Typpo evaluated serial plasma biomarkers of intestinal EBF
      (plasma claudin 3, citrulline, I-FABP, and regulatory cytokines) in 20 children with CHD
      over 5 days, before and after CPB. Dr. Typpo found that intestinal EBF improved with early
      EN, was associated with symptoms of feeding intolerance (Pilot congenital cardiac feeding
      intolerance scale-pCCFIS) (p&lt;0.05) and with characteristics of cardiopulmonary support. The
      current proposal will expand on this pilot data to identify key clinical variables which
      alter intestinal EBF biomarker profiles across 3 centers, leveraging existing practice
      variation for vasoactive infusion titration, and EN delivery. While investigators have
      demonstrated that our pilot CC-FIS correlated with biomarkers of intestinal EBF at a single
      center, study personnel will now validate this score across three centers and between a
      variety of providers.

      The central hypothesis is that plasma biomarkers of intestinal EBF can be used to initiate
      safe delivery of early EN for infants after surgical repair of CHD. Investigators will
      identify clinical variables which act as effect modifiers of intestinal EBF and create
      research tools to assess feeding intolerance in post-operative infants with left-sided CHD.
      Based on our pilot data, we suspect that pressor dose, mean airway pressure, hyperglycemia
      and time to initiation of EN are important variables which may alter intestinal barrier
      profile. Given the emerging data for the importance of the intestinal microbiome on
      intestinal barrier function, we will evaluate change in the intestinal microbiome from
      pre-op and over the first 5 post-operative days to determine how microbiome changes
      correlate with intestinal EBF profile. This proposal will generate pilot and feasibility
      data for a future comparative effectiveness trial to compare the effect of a biomarker based
      decision rule to a clinical decision rule for EN initiation on daily percent of goal
      nutrition delivered, feeding intolerance, and incidence of gastrointestinal complications
      after surgical repair of left-sided congenital cardiac defects. To determine the feasibility
      of plasma intestinal EBF profile to assess readiness for early post-operative EN in infants
      with left sided congenital cardiac defects, investigators will complete the following 2
      specific aims.

      Hypothesis 1: Bedside assessment of post-operative feeding intolerance is reliable between
      providers and at different hospitals in infants after repair of left sided congenital
      cardiac defects.

      Aim 1: Develop a congenital cardiac feeding intolerance scale (CC-FIS) for children under 2
      year of age at a single cardiac center.

      Aim 2: Validate a congenital cardiac feeding intolerance scale (CC-FIS) at 3 cardiac centers
      in infants under 2 years of age after repair of left sided cardiac defects.

      Aim 3: Evaluate the relationship between intestinal EBF profile and the congenital cardiac
      feeding intolerance scale (CC-FIS) at 3 cardiac centers.

      Hypothesis 2: Plasma biomarkers of post-operative intestinal EBF will vary over time and in
      response to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and nutritional support.

      Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of timing of post-operative EN initiation on intestinal EBF
      profile for children under 2 years of age after surgical repair of left sided congenital
      cardiac defects at 3 cardiac centers. Identify clinical variables such as time to EN
      initiation, antibiotic use, mean airway pressure, type of EN, and change in intestinal
      microbiome, which act as effect modifiers of intestinal EBF.

      Aim 2: Develop a biomarker decision rule targeted to maintain normal intestinal EBF profile
      for initiation and titration of post-operative EN for children under 2 years of age who
      undergo surgical repair of left sided congenital cardiac defects.
