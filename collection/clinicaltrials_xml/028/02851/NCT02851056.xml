      The purpose of this study is to test what effects (good and bad) a new cancer vaccine will
      have on participants and their cancer, when administered before and after their autologous
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

      The name of the vaccine is called Dendritic Cell Survivin Vaccine (DC:AdmS). The vaccine is
      made using the participant's own blood cells. The vaccine will contain a virus called an
      adenovirus, similar the virus that causes the common cold. The virus has been changed so it
      cannot infect humans and cause infections. The vaccine will be prepared at Moffitt Cancer
      Center in the Cell Therapy Laboratory Facility.

      This pilot study is designed to test the safety and biological activity of the survivin
      vaccine. A sample size of 10 patients will establish the feasibility of the approach, and
      allow for evaluation of the expected increased T cell response against survivin. Vaccine
      will be administered in two stages. After the first survivin vaccination, patients will be
      mobilized with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and both in vivo-primed T cells
      and stem cells will be collected in the same apheresis (the graft). T cells and the Cluster
      of Differentiation 34 (CD34) progenitor cells will be transferred back to the patient at the
      time of autologous graft infusion. Patients will receive re-vaccination on, or near, day 21
      after transplant. We will assess immune response to survivin for 6 months and compare those
      to pre-vaccine response. To validate the patient's ability to mount an immune response we
      will simultaneous vaccinate against Prevnar13®, a pneumococcus vaccine able to elicit T cell
      immune responses. Immunologic responses will be measured at baseline, after stem cell
      mobilization/collection, 60 days, 90 days, and 180 days after transplant. Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cell (PBMCs) will be isolated and stored in liquid N2. G-CSF cell mobilization,
      mononuclear cell collection, melphalan chemotherapy, and transplant infusion will all be per
      institution standards.

    <description>The safety of DC:AdmS when administered to patients with myeloma before and at day +21 after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The approach for assessing potential toxicity of survivin vaccination will focus predominantly on assessing hematopoietic reconstitution, including T cell repopulation and gastrointestinal toxicity. Investigators will also monitor for autoimmune disorders involving other tissues where survivin expression has been demonstrated: these include keratinocytes and melanocytes, myocardium, liver, breast, and brain. The most sensitive test to assess the potential toxicity of survivin vaccination on hematopoietic function is the time of neutrophil repopulation after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Beginning on day of ASCT, participants will be monitored daily for engraftment, defined by an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells per microliter that is sustained for at least 3 days.</description>

    <description>The ability of DC:AdmS to induce T cell immune responses against survivin when administered to patients with myeloma before and at day +21 after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
Immunologic responses: be measured at baseline prior to the first vaccination (i.e., baseline), after stem cell mobilization and collection (i.e., pre-transplant), and post-transplant at day +60, +90, and +180. Each time 100 cc of peripheral blood will be collected. Immune response evaluations will consist of the following: Determination of the survivin specific T cell frequency using limiting dilution analysis and freely available online software; Analysis of Interferon-γ producing T cells in ELISPOT assays in response to DC loaded survivin peptide pool; Measurement of anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers and T cell responses against cross-reacting material (CRM) adjuvant; Evaluation of immunomodulatory phenotypes by T cell subsets before and after vaccination.</description>

Participants will receive 1 pre-transplant survivin vaccine, 7-30 days prior to stem cell apheresis collection. After the first survivin vaccination, participants will be mobilized with Granulocyte-colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF). A second survivin vaccine will be administered on day +21 (between day+20 and +34) after HCT. All participants will be co-immunized with Prevnar 13 at each time they receive the survivin vaccine.</description>
