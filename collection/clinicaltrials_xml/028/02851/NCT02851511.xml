  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized two-phase clinical trial will enroll 360 participants with age-related
      cognitive decline, but not Alzheimer's disease or other neurodegenerative diseases
      (MoCA&gt;25). Cognitively healthy elderly adults will undergo a CT intervention or education
      training-control (TC) condition in combination with transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) or sham tDCS control. The CT intervention will employ a suite of adaptive training
      tasks (Double Decision - Useful Field of View, Card Shark - Working Memory, and Freeze Frame
      - Arousal-Alerting) from the POSIT Science Brain HQ6, a well validated CT method for
      enhancing cognitive functioning in the elderly. TC will involve exposure to educational
      nature videos and related content questions of the same interval and duration as CT,
      providing a well-matched active control. Participants will receive CT or TC in conjunction
      with tDCS or sham/placebo prefrontal stimulation administered during training. Participants
      will be assessed at baseline, after CT (12 weeks), and at 12-month follow-up. At each time
      point, a comprehensive neurocognitive, clinical and multimodal neuroimaging assessment of
      brain function, metabolic state, and brain structure will be conducted. Functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (FMRI) will be used to assess brain response during working memory,
      attention and memory encoding. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will assess
      cerebral metabolites and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations. GABA concentrations
      from MRS will provide a sensitive marker of neuro-plastic change in task-associated brain
      regions. Alzheimer's disease risk factors (APOE4, familial history), baseline
      clinical/demographic characteristics (e.g., diabetes), and neuroimaging biomarkers (e.g.,
      white matter abnormality load) will assess factors with predictive value for individual
      response to tDCS and CT. Based on power analyses of intervention effects, 80 participants
      will be randomized to the four treatment conditions in phase 1. Following the intervention,
      CT (n=40) and TC (n=40) conditions will be compared. Interim analyses aimed at showing that
      CT has previously established strong effects on cognitive outcomes will be performed,
      thereby enabling elimination of the TC condition. Phase 2 will enroll the remaining 280
      participants into the two CT intervention conditions.

        taking part in an intervention aimed at optimizing and possibly preserving cognitive
        functioning and brain health.
