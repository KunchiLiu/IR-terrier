  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive pulse oximetry-determined SpHb will be compared to ABG co-oximetry and research
      lab equipment-determined Hb values, Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) will be correlated with paO2
      via ABG, PVI and acoustic waveform data will be compared to the arterial waveform extracted
      SVV or PPV values. The study goal is to establish the correlation of Hb values determined by
      the SpHb system with Hb as measured by other validated devices, use ORI to correlate with
      paO2 in the moderate hyperoxic regions and correlation of PVI with SVV or PPV values.
