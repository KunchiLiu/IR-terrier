      The geko™ device is indicated for the prevention and treatment of oedema. The aim of this
      study is to show that recruiting, and performing study assessments in ankle fracture
      patients requiring surgery to fix their ankle attending the James Cook Hospital is feasible,
      and to obtain data to support the powering of a larger study to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of the geko™ device at reducing length of stay for this population of
      patients. This study will also allow us to assess the acceptability, tolerability and
      compliance of treatment with the geko device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18-60 years old

          2. Clinically and radiologically diagnosed acute ankle fracture that, in the opinion of
             the treating surgeon, requires operative fixation

          3. Able to understand the Patient Information Sheet (PIS) and willing to sign the
             written Informed Consent Form.

          4. Able and willing to follow the protocol requirements.

          4. Clinically significant co-morbidities that need to be treated prior to surgical
             intervention and could therefore impact upon time to theatre

          5. History or signs of previous deep or superficial vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism.

          6. Varicosities, ulceration or erosion around the area of the leg where the study device
