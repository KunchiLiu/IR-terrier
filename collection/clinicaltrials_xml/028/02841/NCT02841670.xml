      This is a monocentric, longitudinal, prospective, observational post-market follow-up study.

      30 patients with a cataract will receive an InFo - Instant Focus © lens implant. After the
      cataract procedure, data collection will take place during visits planned by the physician
      as part of normal follow-up.

      Patients with cataract will be recruited from the clinic by the investigator based on the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The patient will be followed up after one day, one week, one month, six months, one year and
      three years post-op. An interim analysis will be performed with one-year clinical results.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate is to evaluate efficacy and long-term safety
      for the InFo - Instant Focus © lens.
