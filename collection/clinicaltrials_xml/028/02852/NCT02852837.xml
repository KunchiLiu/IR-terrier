  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety and the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile of daratumumab in Chinese participants with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma (MM) who failed at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy.

    <measure>Systemic Clearance (CL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Follow-up Phase-Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic Clearance (CL) is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the body. The total systemic clearance after intravenous dose was estimated by dividing the total administered dose by the plasma Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC [0-infinity]).</description>

    <description>Elimination half-life (t[1/2]) is associated with the terminal slope (lambda [z]) of the semi-logarithmic drug concentration-time curve, calculated as 0.693/lambda(z).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of Distribution (Vd)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Follow-up Phase-Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Vd is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Follow-up Phase-Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve CR (including sCR) according to the IMWG criteria, during or after the study treatment. IMWG criteria CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and less than (&lt;)5 % plasma cells (PCs) in bone marrowÍ¾ sCR: CR along with normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and absence of clonal PCs by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence or 2 to 4 color flow cytometry. PR: more than equal to (&gt;=) 50percent (%) reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by &gt;=90% or to &lt;200 mg/24 hours; VGPR: Serum and urine M-component detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or &gt;= 90 % reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein less than (&lt;)100 mg/24 hours.</description>

    <measure>Time to Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Follow-up Phase-Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response is defined as the time between the date of first dosing and the first efficacy evaluation that the participant has met all criteria for PR (including VGPR) and CR (including sCR).</description>

    <description>Participants will receive single dose of daratumumab from Week 1 till Week 3 (Period 1 - single dosing period) followed by 6 weekly doses of daratumumab until Week 9 (Period 2 - weekly dosing period) and every 2 weeks for 8 infusions and then once every 4 weeks from Week 26 until disease progression, intolerability, or other reasons for treatment discontinuation (Period 3 - less intense dosing period). A dose of 8 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) will be chosen as the starting dose and will be escalated to 16 mg/kg if the 8 mg/kg is determined safe and tolerated by study evaluation team (SET).</description>
