    <textblock>
      Insulin resistant volunteers will undergo an 8-week cold treatment, 2 hours per day, to
      selective regions of the body enriched with brown fat including neck, supraclavicular and
      interscapular regions) in combination with electroacupuncture (EA). Their insulin
      sensitivity and glucose and lipid homeostasis will be measured. The brown fat activation
      will be determined by analyzing fat biopsy samples and/or positron emission tomography and
      computed tomography (PET/CT)-scans.

    <description>The volunteers will undergo cold treatment to neck, supraclavicular interscapular regions for 2 hours daily for 8 weeks. The temperature is below 10 degree celsius achieved by ice pads or refrigerated vest and electroacupuncture is conducted by commercially available device. Insulin sensitivity will be determined by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp at 0 week and 8 week of treatment. Glucose tolerance will be measured by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 0, 4, 8 week of treatment. Blood will be drawn at 0, 4, 8 week to measure related parameters. In vivo brown fat activation will be assessed by PET-CT scan at 0 and 8 week. Fat biopsy will be taken from the treated area at 0 and 8 week. The participants will be instructed to maintain their normal behavior and calorie intake.</description>
