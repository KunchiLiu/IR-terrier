  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      655130 in healthy male subjects following IV administration of multiple rising doses. The
      study will also explore safety and tolerability following a single IV administration.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigator`s assessment, based on a complete
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP - Blood Pressure,
             PR - Pulse Rate), 12-lead ECG (Electrocardiogram), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)

          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP - Blood Pressure, PR - Pulse
             Rate or ECG - Electrocardiogram) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically
             relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside
             the range of 45 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to
             be of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Further exclusion criteria apply
