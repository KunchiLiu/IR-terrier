        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Other than renal impairment, subjects should be in good health as determined by no
             clinically significant findings from medical history, physical exam, and laboratory
             evaluations

          -  Subjects must have a BMI between 18.0 kg/m2 and 36 kg/m2, with a body weight of at
             least 50 kg and no more than 120 kg

             disease without evidence of renal progression in the past 28 days prior to dosing

          -  Additional criteria for healthy matched subjects:

          -  Matched to at least 1 renal impairment subject by race, age (+/-10 years), gender and
             weight (+/-10%)

          -  An absolute GFR of at least 90 ml/min

          -  Significant acute illness within the two weeks prior to dosing

          -  History or presence of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history
             or presence of prolonged QT-interval syndrome

          -  History or current diagnosis of cardiac disease indicating significant risk of safety
             for subjects participating in the study such as uncontrolled or significant cardiac
             disease

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within 5 years,
             regardless of where there is recurrence or metastases.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to dosing or evidence of such
             abuse as indicated by laboratory values at screening or baseline.

        Additional exclusion for renal impairment subjects:

          -  Severe albuminuria &gt; 300 mg/day.

          -  Subjects undergoing any method of dialysis.

          -  Subjects with renal impairment due to hepatic disease (hepatorenal syndrome).

          -  Subjects with clinically significant abnormal findings, not consistent with clinical
             disease, upon physical examination, ECG or laboratory evaluation.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion may apply.
