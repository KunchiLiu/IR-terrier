  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this initiative is to improve care and outcomes for infants with HLHS by
      expanding the NPC-QIC national registry to gather clinical care process, outcome, and
      developmental data on infants with HLHS between diagnosis and 12 months of age, by improving
      the use of standards into everyday practice across pediatric cardiology centers, and by
      engaging parents as partners in the process.

      The purpose of this initiative is to improve care and outcomes for infants with HLHS by: 1)
      expanding the established NPC-QIC national registry to gather clinical care process,
      outcome, and developmental data on infants with HLHS between diagnosis and 12 months of age,
      2) improving implementation of consensus standards, tested by teams, into everyday practice
      across pediatric cardiology centers, and 3) engaging parents as partners in improving care
      and outcomes.

As more information is gathered in this registry, the study team will determine the data analyses methods to determine if the knowledge gained led to changes in care delivery and/or to better patient outcomes.</description>
