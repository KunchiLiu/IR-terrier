  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a standard treatment option for cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)
      dependent atrial flutter. We plan to perform a randomized prospective trial comparing the
      efficacy of contact force (CF) guided CTI ablation against catheter ablation with the
      operator blinded to contact force parameters.
