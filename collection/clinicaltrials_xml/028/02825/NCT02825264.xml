    <textblock>
      STARflo is a novel suprachoroidal Glaucoma Drainage Device (GDD), bleb-free, exhibiting
      anti-fibrotic properties. Release of this CE Marked implant has been limited to leading
      Glaucoma Centers in Europe. Therefore this Clinical Experience Program is being initiated to
      expand the surgical and clinical practice knowledge about the use of STARflo for reducing
      intraocular pression (IOP) in patients suffering from open angle glaucoma in a real world
      population of patient.

      This program is designed to be an international multicenter observational study Patient data
      may be collected retrospectively and/or prospectively for up to 5 years after surgery.

      The aim of this program is to document the patient's benefit following implantation of the
      STARflo implant in a real-word patient population, to learn about surgical practices and to
      collect data to support future cost-effectiveness analysis
