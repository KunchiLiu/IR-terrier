    <textblock>
      This phase I, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of atezolizumab in Chinese participants with locally
      advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer,
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and other solid tumor types that are refractory to standard
      therapeutic modalities and for whom no further standard therapy is available or who have
      refused standard therapy.
