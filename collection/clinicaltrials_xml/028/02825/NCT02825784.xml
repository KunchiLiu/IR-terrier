      A multicenter, open label, uncontrolled study to evaluate the acceptability, tolerability,
      and nutritional suitability of a medical food (Renastart, Vitaflo International Ltd)
      specially formulated to meet the unique nutritional needs of children from birth to 10 years
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD)

      Primary Objective To investigate the nutritional suitability of Renastart in children aged
      10 years and under with CKD, particularly with respect to the dietary management of
      hyperkalemia and the maintenance / improvement of growth.

      Secondary Objectives To investigate the acceptance, compliance, palatability, and tolerance
      of Renastart in children aged under 10 years with CKD.

      A total of 15 children with CKD will be enrolled in the study.

    <description>Compared to cows' milk and/or standard pediatric enteral feeds, Renastart has the following additional nutritional features that are beneficial in children with CKD: lower phosphorus, calcium and vitamin A. The powder presentation allows flexibility with dilutions to facilitate the provision of adequate energy and protein to support growth in children with CKD.
For each subject, the recommended daily intake of Renastart is determined by the dietitian in collaboration with the local PI and primary nephrologist based on individual nutritional requirements, specifically dietary intake of potassium and serum potassium levels.
Renastart is to be given by the clinician and based on clinical and nutritional needs. Standard preparation guidelines can be found on the Renastart label.</description>
