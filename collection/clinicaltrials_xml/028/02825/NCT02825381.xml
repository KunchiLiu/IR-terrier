    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the success rate of routine one-stage exchange
      for treatment of chronically infected total hip arthroplasty performed at the investigators
      institution, and to compare it to the current literature reporting success rate of selected
      one-stage exchange procedure or two-stage procedure.

      The secondary goal is to detect the potential prognostic factors and potential selection
      criteria which may influence the success rate. The tested hypothesis is following: the
      success rate of routine one-stage exchange is lower than that of selected one-stage or
      two-stage procedure
