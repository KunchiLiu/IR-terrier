      We are investigating ways to reduce pain after abdominoplasty. We hypothesize that injection
      of Dysport (botulinum toxin A) into the rectus abdominis, abdominal wall musculature, during
      abdominoplasty will provide a more effective, longer lasting method for pain control than
      standard of care alone (use of Exparel (liposomal bupivacaine) intraoperatively followed by
      PRN narcotics. We will randomize patients to receive either Disport + standard of care or
      saline (placebo) + standard of care and compare post operative pain for the following 2-3
      months.

    <textblock>
      Pain control after abdominoplasty is an important aspect of patients' post-operative
      experience. Several methods, including the use of pain pumps, regional blocks, and liposomal
      bupivacaine, to reduce post-abdominoplasty pain have been described (1-4). The use of these
      techniques has reduced reported postoperative pain, narcotic requirements, and time to
      ambulation / normal activity to varying degrees. Unfortunately, these techniques are not
      without potential complications or limitations (e.g. seroma, cost, inconvenience, or short
      effect).

      Botulinum toxin A (BT) is a neuromuscular blocking agent derived from the bacterium
      Clostridium botulinum type A. It acts by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine at the
      neuromuscular junction. Botulinum toxin A is now not only used to mollify chronic pain
      (5-7), but has also been shown to reduce the pain associated with post-mastectomy breast
      reconstruction and breast augmentation when injected into the pectoralis muscle (8-10).
      Although the exact mechanism by which BT reduces pain is not clear, it may alter the
      sensitivity and response of muscle nociceptors and cholinergic signals (11). Injection of BT
      into the abdominal wall musculature (rectus abdominis, external and internal oblique, and
      transversus abdominis) under direction visualization may provide a safe, effective, longer
      lasting method for pain control than previously described techniques.

      This is an exploratory, randomized pilot study with patients blinded to treatment for
      management of pain after abdominoplasty. There will be two study arms: (1) patients
      receiving intramuscular injections of intraoperative BT + standard of care and (2) patients
      receiving intraoperative saline placebo + standard of care (control). Microsoft Excel will
      be used to create a random list of 100 numbers with 50 of those numbers designating arm 1
      treatment group and the other 50 designating arm 2 treatment group. These will be printed
      and placed in envelopes with treatment group on the inside and patient number on the
      outside.

      Patients seen in the clinic preoperatively will be given informed consent and will then be
      assigned a treatment envelope by a nurse, which will be kept in the patient's chart. Both
      patient and nurse will be blinded to the treatment group.

      Intraoperatively, the envelope will be opened and used to identify the patient's treatment
      by the OR nurse and surgeon, who will then administer treatment when clinically appropriate
      prior to wound closure, either botulinum toxin or equivalent dose of saline alone. Botulinum
      toxin A (Brand: Dysport), 300 U, will be diluted in 20 mL of normal saline. The treatment
      will be injected just under the rectus abdominis fascia along its length.

      The treatment given will be recorded in the patient's chart. Immediately post-operatively
      prior to discharge, patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire (attached), which
      will assess their pain using a visual analog pain scale of 1-10.

      After discharge, patients will be asked to record daily opioid use and will again be given
      the questionnaire assessing pain, time to return to ambulation, and time to return to
      &quot;normal&quot; activity. This will be completed at the initial post-operative visit and via phone
      call and recorded by a nurse who is blinded to the treatment group. Assessment will be
      attempted weekly for the first month in the office or by phone and bimonthly afterwards for
      the following two months. We will follow the patients for this duration as BT begins working
      within six hours after administration with a maximum effect between seven and 14 days.

      Abdominoplasty will be performed by the same operative surgeon using the same technique
      throughout the duration of the study. There will be no additional costs to the patient.

      All deidentified data will be stored in RedCap, a secure web application.

      Study Population:

      The study population will include non-pregnant, non-nursing patients over age 18 years with
      the ability to provide informed consent, undergoing abdominoplasty at the treating surgeon's
      outpatient surgical center. Exclusion criteria include a history of pre-existing
      neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, or amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to Dysport, use of aminoglycosides at the
      time of surgery (as these antibiotics can potentiate the effect of BT), reported use of BT
      in the four months preceding surgery, daily pre-operative opioid use, skin infection at the
      planned surgical site.

      Study drug / Interventions:

      Dysport (abobotulinumtoxinA) for injection, for intramuscular use. Once reconstituted, it
      must be stored at 2-8°C, protected from light, and used within 24 hours. For Injection: 300
      Units or 500 Units lyophilized powder in a single-use vial for reconstitution with
      preservative -free 0.9% Sodium Chloride.

      Study Schedule/Timeline:

      After IRB approval, approximately two patients will undergo abdominoplasty per month for the
      subsequent two years. After the follow-up period of three months, it is anticipated that
      this study will conclude after approximately 2-2.5 years.

      Statistical Analysis Plan:

      Randomization Eligible and consenting patients will be randomized to intervention and
      control groups using 1:1 allocation ratio. The surgical team will by randomly select a
      sealed envelopes contain treatment allocation and then administer the respective treatment.
      The data collector and data analyst will be blinded to group allocation.

      Power and Sample size A power analysis based on the differences between the baseline and 8
      week observations. If it is assumed that both treatment groups have a common standard
      deviation of 1.25, then 52 subjects would need to be recruited in order to observe a 1
      difference in the change based on a two-sample t-test performed at the 0.05 level at 80%
      power. It is assumed that the dropout rate will be 10%, thus, 58 total subjects should be
      recruited. This sample size estimate is likely to be conservative, in that the
      intention-to-treat analysis that will be performed will have higher power then the analysis
      used to determine sample size since dropouts and longitudinal information will be used in
      the analysis.

      Analysis plan All analyses will be performed in accordance to the CONSORT Statement. Patient
      demographics and outcomes variables will be summarized with means and standard deviations,
      median and interquartile ranges, or frequencies and percentages. The distribution of each of
      the demographic and outcome variables will be compared between the treatment groups using
      t-tests or Wilcoxon tests, chi-square tests, or log-rank tests (for time-to-event outcomes).
      We will analyze data following an intention-to-treat principle. The primary study aim will
      compare intervention and control group will be made using a repeated-measures ANOVA model
      which will contain the time, intervention group, and the interaction between the two
      variables. Estimates of the differences between the study groups will be accompanied by
      corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals, which will be adjusted for multiple
      comparison is the omnibus test for differences between the treatment groups at any time
      point indicate a difference. This analysis will be adjusted for covariates that are either
      not balanced by randomization or have significant relationship with each outcome. A similar
      model will be use to assess the relationship between opium daily dose and treatment group. A
      Cox proportional hazard model will be used to compare the time to return to work and
      activities between the intervention groups.

      The aforementioned analyses require assumptions. In the event that the assumptions are not
      met, transformations and alternate analyses will be considered. All statistical tests will
      be performed using two-sided tests at the 0.05 significance level with SAS® 9.4 (2).
