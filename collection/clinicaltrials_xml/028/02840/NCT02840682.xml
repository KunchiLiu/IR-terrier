    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe mortality of newborns who received basic,
      advanced or no neonatal resuscitation immediately after birth at Shoklo Malaria Research
      Unit.

      This is a retrospective, descriptive study of hospital records will be conducted. The
      existing dataset of newborns of ≥28 weeks gestation delivered at Shoklo Malaria Research
      Unit clinics from January 2008 to December 2015 will be analysed.

      In the dataset, 15224 newborns fulfill the inclusion criteria and therefore they will all be
      analysed with IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for Windows.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to define: a) the proportion of newborns alive at 24
      hours, 7 days, 28 days, and at 1 year, following resuscitation at SMRU birthing rooms and b)
      the number of newborns requiring basic and advanced resuscitation.

      Measurements of correlation coefficient will be used to compare Shoklo Developmental test
      scores and developmental milestones attained at 1 year in resuscitated and non-resuscitated
      infants. The Pearson correlation coefficient will be used if the relationship between two
      variables is found to be linear.

      Antenatal, perinatal and postnatal characteristics associated with neonatal resuscitation
      will be defined by logistic regression analysis.
