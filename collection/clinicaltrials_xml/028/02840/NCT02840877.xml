  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) remains the second leading cause of death due to an
      infectious disease globally. Retrospective studies from many countries, including the United
      States and South Africa, have consistently reported that in addition to having a higher
      burden of TB disease, patients with problem alcohol use have worse TB treatment outcomes.
      This prospective study will attempt to clarify both behavioral and biologic causal
      mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of problem alcohol use on TB treatment
      response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major knowledge gap is the degree to which poor treatment outcomes in alcohol-abusing
      patients are due to noncompliance alone. Problem alcohol use impacts on retention in care
      and adherence to daily TB treatment. Poor medication adherence and increased default from TB
      care have been documented for patients consuming alcohol regularly in several countries. Yet
      there has been no research to identify reasons (beyond adherence) for these poorer outcomes
      among patients with problem alcohol use. A key barrier to understanding the persistent
      biologic effect of alcohol on TB disease is inadequate data on adherence, including detailed
      data on daily adherence (or number of missed doses of medication). Research combining better
      approaches to alcohol ascertainment and adherence monitoring is needed to advance
      understanding of the pathways by which alcohol use and TB disease interact.

      Aim 1: To (i) examine the associations between problem alcohol use and TB treatment
      outcomes, and (ii) demonstrate that these associations persist independent of adherence to
      TB treatment.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of problem alcohol use on the PK/PD of TB drugs.

      Culture-positive, pulmonary TB patients will be recruited in Worcester, South Africa, and
      followed over an 18-month period. Patients will complete an interviewer-administered
      questionnaire on their alcohol use and other health-related behaviors, and their recent
      alcohol use will be confirmed using a biomarker (phosphatidylethanol). Chest radiographs,
      sputum smears and culture, and blood samples will be collected to compare the biology of
      treatment response in patients with and without problem alcohol use. During the 6-month
      treatment period, smart mobile-phone technology will be used to document daily drug
      adherence by trained community workers. Serial measures of alcohol intake and serial sputa
      isolates will be collected to assess treatment response and TB drug side effects will be
      recorded. In addition, intensive PK/PD studies of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and
      pyrazinamide will be performed in 200 HIV-seronegative patients. The full cohort will be
      followed for 12 months post-treatment to examine long-term TB outcomes, including relapse
      and death.
