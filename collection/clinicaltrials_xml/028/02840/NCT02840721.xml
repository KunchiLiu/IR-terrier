  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, single arm, two-stage study in subjects with moderate to severe
      ulcerative colitis. Subjects will receive 500 mg of PF-06480605 intravenously every 2 weeks
      for a total of 7 doses. Blood, stool, and tissue samples will be collected at various time
      points throughout the study to evaluate safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics,
      and immunogenicity. Duration of participation for subjects will be approximately 8 months.
