      As biologic treatments are expensive and associated with some concerns regarding long-term
      safety, investigator hypothesize that early tapering and then withdrawal of biological
      agent, in an homogenous group of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis achieving
      inactive disease, is safe and not inferior to the maintenance of stable treatment intensity
      over 24 weeks. In addition, investigator also hypothesize that an earlier tapering of
      treatment is associated with a better quality-of-life and a general cost saving effect.
      MRP8/14 will be studied as a potential biomarker for the risk of relapse. A study for
      biologic agent, anti-biologic agent antibodies and a pharmacogenomic approach will complete
      the research, as pharmacokinetic study during withdrawal of biologic treatment are rare in
      children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is characterized by chronic arthritis of unknown
      etiology starting before the age of 16. There are four to five thousand paediatric patients
      with JIA in France. Most of these patients are diagnosed with oligoarticular or rheumatoid
      factor negative polyarticular JIA. The prognosis of the disease has dramatically improved
      thanks to the introduction of biologic agents in patients with an extended oligoarticular or
      rheumatoid factor negative polyarticular JIA and inadequate response to methotrexate.
      Inactive disease and long-lasting clinical remission are achieved in most cases. &quot;Treat to
      target&quot; approaches are increasingly recommended, with earlier introduction of biologics,
      however the way to taper or withdraw treatment in patients achieving inactive disease is not
      codified. As biologic treatments are expensive and associated with some concerns regarding
      long-term safety, this study aim to test, in a randomized fashion, the hypothesis that early
      tapering of biologic agents (i.e. increasing the intervals between injections as soon as
      inactive disease is documented) is safe and non-inferior to the maintenance of stable
      treatment intensity over 24 weeks, and therefore test the possibility of early biologic
      agent withdrawal. It will also study concentrations of different biological agent, the
      occurrence of anti-drugs antibodies while tapering and then withdrawing biologics, and their
      possible association with a higher risk of relapse. In addition, investigators will test if
      the serum level of proteins 100 (MRP8/14) could be predictive of flares. Finally,
      pharmaco-economic analyses and quality of life studies will be conducted.

    <description>Inactive disease is defined by the criterion of Wallace :
No joints with active arthritis,
No active uveitis as defined by the SUN Working Group2 (The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group defines inactive anterior uveitis as &quot;grade zero cells,&quot; indicating_1 cell in field sizes of 1 mm by a 1-mm slit beam),
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level within normal limits in the laboratory where tested or, if elevated, not attributable to JIA
Physician's global assessment of disease activity score (&lt; 10/100 visual analogue scale),
and duration of morning stiffness &lt; or egal to 15 minutes (within 7 days before the visit).
For all the visits, joint counts and physician global assessment of disease activity will be performed by an investigator blinded from patient study group.</description>
