  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed clinical study is to investigate the safety and tolerability
      of CV301 in combination with OPDIVO® (nivolumab), an anti PD1- inhibitor, compared to
      nivolumab alone in subjects with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
      clinical study is designed to evaluate the possible enhanced antitumor activity of CV301
      with nivolumab compared to nivolumab alone in a setting in which nivolumab is the
      standard-of-care, second-line therapy, for metastatic NSCLC. The rationale for combining
      CV301 with nivolumab is based on the hypothesis that CV301 can induce specific immune
      response in the tumor, and that in combination, nivolumab may augment the T cell-mediated
      immune response generated by CV301 by blocking the inhibitory signal of the PD-1.

      The study will include a Phase 1 dose escalation part to assess the safety and tolerability
      of CV301 alone, prior to moving into the combination with nivolumab (the Phase 1b
      component). The Phase 1 part of the trial will be followed by a Phase 1b component to test
      in a single arm lead-in stage the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment, i.e.
      CV301 plus nivolumab, before expanding the number of patients to be treated in the
      randomized Phase 2 part of the trial. The objective of the Phase 2 is to assess the safety
      and preliminary efficacy of CV301 in combination with nivolumab compared to nivolumab alone
      in subjects with previously treated NSCLC.
