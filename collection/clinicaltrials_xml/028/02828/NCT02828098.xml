      12 to 24 patients with aggressive solid tumors from whom biopsies can be obtained, will
      receive BO-112 through IT administration.

      Injected lesions must be palpable and biopsiable at the time of injection, and biopsied
      after 7-14 days. Patients will not receive an alternative therapy during the period
      comprising from first and second biopsy. BO-112 will be administered at a starting dose.
      Upon confirmation of the safety profile of the starting dose and evaluation of the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, three additional dose levels are expected to be tested.

      During the course of the study, subjects will be examined for any side effects that may
      occur (safety and tolerability).

      Additionally this study will also study BO-112 biological activity, the innate and adaptive
      immune system response and signaling pathways, as well as signs of clinical relevance, will
      be studied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients age 18 years or more on the day of signing informed consent form.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed aggressive solid tumors

          3. Patients must have:

               -  Biopsy-accessible tumors

               -  No prior anticancer treatment during the last 14 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Other relevant and clinically significant concomitant diseases or adverse clinical
        conditions which may jeopardize patient safety:

          -  Increased cardiac risk: congestive heart failure; or unstable angina pectoris; or
             arrhythmia requiring treatment or uncontrolled arterial hypertension; or myocardial
             infarction within 12 months before inclusion in the study.

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) lesions (including carcinomatous
             meningitis) will be excluded. However, patients will be eligible if:

               -  All known CNS lesions have been treated with stereotactic therapy or surgery,
                  AND

               -  There has been no evidence of clinical and radiographic disease progression in
                  the CNS for ≥ 4 weeks after radiotherapy or surgery, and has not required to
                  increase in the last 4 weeks their steroids use or has not started a new course
                  of steroids

               -  Whole brain radiotherapy is not allowed, with the exception of patients who have
                  had definitive resection or stereotactic therapy of all radiologically
                  detectable parenchymal brain lesions.

          -  Active infection.

          -  Significant non-neoplastic liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, active chronic hepatitis B
             or C).

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality on history or examination including diagnosis
             of immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication
             (physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the
             Sponsor).
