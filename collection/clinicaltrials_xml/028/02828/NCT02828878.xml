  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ApoGraft product is a mobilized peripheral blood cell product of a matched Related donor,
      collected via apheresis, which is exposed to the apoptotic mediator Fas Ligand (CD95L) prior
      to transplantation.

      The study is designed to address the aspects of engraftment and Prevention of Acute Graft
      versus Host Disease (aGvHD) rate and/or severity in 12 Patients

      STUDY DESIGN:

      open label, linear with four-cohorts each consisting of 3 patients.

      The study consists of a screening phase (subject and donor clinical assessment and screening
      tests), transplantation of ApoGraft, and a follow-up period of 180 days during and after
      hospitalization.

      Cohorts' differentiation is by the escalating concentration of the apoptotic mediator Fas
      Ligand to which the transplant is exposed during incubation prior to transplantation,
      ranging from 10 ng/ml in the first cohort to 100 ng/ml in the fourth cohort.

      The study will progress from one cohort to the next based on a DSMB analysis of the safety
      data.
