  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label trail to test the hypothesize that serum bovine immunoglobulin protein
      isolate (SBI) will improve the nutritional status and quality of life (QOL) of patients with
      an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) and symptoms of pouchitis. Subjects with symptomatic
      IPAA will receive two packets of EnteraGam twice daily (total daily dose of 20 g SBI) for up
      to 24 weeks. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether SBI therapy leads
      to improved nutritional status and QOL. A secondary objective is to evaluate SBI in the
      management of their disease, including impact on clinical symptoms.
