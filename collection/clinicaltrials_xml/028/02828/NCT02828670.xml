  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T follicular helper lymphocytes are involved in the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases.
      In humans, an increase in the proportion of circulating follicular helper T lymphocytes is
      observed in systemic lupus erythematous, Sjögren syndrome. No study has yet been conducted
      in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In another autoimmune cytopenia, immunological
      thrombocytopenia pathogenesis (ITP), the investigators showed for the first time an increase
      in circulating TFH and splenic TFH and their implication in the activation of autoreactive B
      lymphocytes.

      Hypothesis is that autoimmune hemolytic anemia is associated with an increase in the number
      and/of function of TFH, which thus participate in the hyperactivation of B lymphocytes.

      The demonstration that TFH are implicated in autoimmune hemolytic anemia will rapidly lead
      to the use of targeted therapies to inhibit these cells. These treatments are in the
      clinical phase of development in other autoimmune diseases.

      This study is interventional because of a lots of blood sample
