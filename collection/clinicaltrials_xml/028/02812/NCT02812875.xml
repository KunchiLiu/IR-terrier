  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CA-170 is a rationally designed and orally available, small molecule that directly targets
      the Programmed death-ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1/PD-L2), and V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell
      activation (VISTA) immune checkpoints and results in activation of T cell proliferation and
      cytokine production. This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1 trial of orally
      administered CA-170 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas who have
      progressed or are non-responsive to available therapies and for which no standard therapy
      exists.
