  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiome is a new target to improve burden of disease measures in mood disorders,
      yet novel interventions to affect the gut microbial complement and improve psychiatric
      outcomes have not been developed. Animal studies show causative influence of the gut
      microbiome on developmental trajectories of central neurochemical systems to effect
      anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors. Preliminary studies in humans show psychiatric
      benefit of pre- and pro-biotic supplementation in depressed individuals. However, it has not
      been determined which gut microbes are beneficial or detrimental to human mental illness and
      how to specifically target them for therapeutic benefit. Our long-term goal is to determine
      effective methods to target the human gut microbiome to improve mental health treatment
      outcomes. The objective of this study is to determine how specific dietary control alters
      the microbiome composition to effect clinical outcome measures in a longitudinal study of
      individuals with bipolar disorder. Our central hypothesis is that a low carbohydrate (CHO) /
      high polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) diet will increase the fractional representation of specific
      butyrate producing members of the Firmicutes phylum in the gut microbiome, which will
      attenuate host inflammation, improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety in bipolar patients.
      The rationale for the proposed research is to take the first step in a continuum of studies
      to develop personalized novel approaches to treat mood disorders, including the need to
      address gut dysbiosis, which often co-occurs with mental illness. The investigators will
      test our hypothesis and achieve the objective of this proposal with the following Specific
      Aims: 1) Determine the taxonomical change in the stool microbiome following a low CHO / high
      PUFA diet; and 2) Determine the changes in sleep quality, anxiety, and depression following
      a low CHO / high PUFA diet. These aims will be achieved using the unique resources at the
      University of Michigan, including the Nutrition Assessment Laboratory for dietary
      intervention, the Host-Microbiome Laboratory for microbial assays, and the ongoing Prechter
      Longitudinal Study of Bipolar Disorder. At the end of the proposed studies the investigators
      expect to set the stage for future studies to assess neurochemical mechanisms. These data
      will provide a greater understanding of the mechanism by which diet controls the specific
      microbes in the gut microbiome to affect mood disorders and gut dysbiosis and improve
      response to psychiatric treatment paradigms.

    <description>The primary outcome will be measured as an increase in fractional representation of faecalibacterium, as measured by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing of stool samples at baseline and 4 weeks of dietary manipulation. Sequence data will be analyzed as described in the mothur SOP (http://mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP).</description>
