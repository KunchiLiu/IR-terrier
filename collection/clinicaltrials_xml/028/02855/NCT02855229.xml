  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this multi-disciplinary research program is to develop and optimize
      new cross-species translational assessments of reward and cognition that will not only be
      assessed in parallel in humans and rats, but also produce neurophysiological and behavioral
      metrics that can be objectively compared across species. The research will build on prior
      studies by further developing and optimizing (in Phase 1), then validating via
      pharmacological challenge (in Phase 2), the following assays in both humans and rats:

        1. advanced neurophysiological and computational modeling techniques to record and analyze
           EEG activity within and across species; and

        2. behavioral assessments of reward learning, cognitive control, and cognitive flexibility
           will be analyzed within and across species.

      The second phase of the study will test the translational validity of these assays, by
      assessing the impact of a targeted drug on task performance and EEG activity in both
      species.

      The overarching goal of this multi-disciplinary research program is to develop and optimize
      new translational assessments of reward and cognition that will produce neurophysiological
      and behavioral metrics that enable objective comparison of drug effects.

      Phase 1 (2016-2018) will seek to develop and optimize computer-based tasks to measure of
      reward learning and cognition, to be administered during an EEG examination. Each
      participant will be asked to come for a single visit to complete a brief psychological
      assessment (interview and surveys), then perform one of the computer-based tasks while EEG
      data are collected.

      In Phase 2 (2018-2020), a new set of participants will be enrolled for four visits. At the
      first visit they will have a brief psychological assessment (interview and surveys). They
      will then be assigned to one of the tasks developed during Phase I, and they will also be
      assigned to one of the study drugs: amisulpride (a dopamine enhancer), vortioxetine (a
      serotonin enhancer), or modafinil (a cognitive enhancer). At the second, third, and fourth
      visit, the subject will be given their drug in one of the three doses: a low dose, a higher
      dose, and a placebo. They will then perform the assigned task during an EEG exam.
