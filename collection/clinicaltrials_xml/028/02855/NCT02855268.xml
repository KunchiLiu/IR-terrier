    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase 2 study
      conducted in subjects with Alport syndrome at multiple investigative centers.To meet the GFR
      enrollment criteria, subjects must have an eGFR of 45 to 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 at the first
      screening visit and demonstrate a decline in eGFR during the screening period. Subjects may
      screen for enrollment directly in this study or after participation in the RG012-01 ATHENA
      Natural History Study.

      For subjects participating in the ATHENA Study, genotype, demographics, prior/concomitant
      medications, medical history, and family history data from that study may be used to satisfy
      entry criteria in the current study. Data obtained in the ATHENA Study for clinical
      laboratory tests (other than eGFR) may be used as screening data for the present study if
      obtained within 4 weeks prior to baseline. Physical examination results from the ATHENA
      study may be used as screening data for the present study if obtained within 12 weeks prior
      to baseline.

      Active Treatment Period - Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive
      weekly subcutaneous (SC) injections of RG-012 110 mg, RG-012 220 mg, or placebo for 24
      weeks.

      Subjects taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor
      blockers (ARBs) will be required to maintain these agents at a stable dose and regimen for
      the duration of the active treatment period. All other concomitant medications should also
      be maintained at a stable dose and regimen during the study.

      Follow-up Period - Subjects completing 24 weeks of treatment will be eligible to screen for
      enrollment in an extension study in which all subjects receive active treatment. Subjects
      who do not enter the extension will have a safety follow-up home visit 4 weeks (Week 28)
      after the end of the active treatment period and a safety follow-up clinic visit 12 weeks
      (Week 36) after the end of the active treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive)

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of Alport syndrome (clinical, histopathologic, and/or genetic
             diagnosis)

          3. eGFR criteria must be met

          4. Proteinuria ≥500 mg protein/g creatinine at initial screening and baseline visits

          5. On a stable dosing regimen of an ACE inhibitor and/or ARB for ≥30 days prior to
             screening (unless unable to tolerate either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Causes of chronic kidney disease aside from Alport syndrome (including, but not
             limited to, diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, lupus, IgA nephropathy)

          2. ESRD as evidenced by ongoing dialysis therapy or history of renal transplantation

          3. Any other condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may
             make the subject unlikely to complete the study or comply with study procedures and
             requirements, or may pose a risk to the subject's safety and well-being
