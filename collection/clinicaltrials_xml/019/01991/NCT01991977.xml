    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well fluorine F 18 fluorodopa (18F-DOPA)-positron emission
      tomography (PET) works in finding tumors in patients with newly diagnosed gliomas undergoing
      radiation therapy. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done before and during
      radiation therapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan
      the best treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare progression free survival at 12 months for grade IV glioma patients after
      radiation therapy targeting volumes designed with both 18F-DOPA PET and conventional
      magnetic resonance (MR) image information with historical controls from Mayo Clinic
      Rochester patients treated on North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) clinical trials.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare progression free survival at 12 months for grade III patients after radiation
      therapy targeting volumes designed with both 18F-DOPA PET and conventional MR image
      information with historical controls from Mayo Clinic Rochester patients on NCCTG clinical
      trials.

      II. Compare patient outcomes including overall survival after radiation therapy targeting
      volumes designed with both 18F-DOPA PET and conventional MR image information with
      historical controls from Mayo Clinic Rochester patients on NCCTG clinical trials.

      III. Evaluate quality of life after radiotherapy treatment targeting dose escalated volumes
      defined to include high 18F-DOPA PET uptake.

      IV. Determine acute and late effect toxicity after radiotherapy treatment targeting dose
      escalated volumes defined to include high 18F-DOPA PET uptake.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare radiation therapy (RT) treatment volumes defined by MR only with RT treatment
      volumes defined with both PET and MR information for grade IV glioma patients.

      II. Compare timing of accurate identification of progression defined by 18F-DOPA PET,
      perfusion MRI (pMRI) and conventional MRI for grade IV glioma patients.

      III. Compare patterns of failure after radiation therapy targeting volumes defined with
      target volumes designed to with both 18F-DOPA PET and conventional MR image information with
      patterns of failure for historical controls from Mayo Clinic Rochester patients on NCCTG
      clinical trials.

      IV. Compare RT treatment volumes defined by MR only with RT treatment volumes defined with
      both PET and MR information for grade III glioma patients.

      V. Evaluate intra- and inter-observer variability with vs. without the addition of 18F-DOPA
      PET uptake for radiotherapy target volume delineation.

      VI. Compare timing of accurate identification of progression defined by 18F-DOPA PET, pMRI
      and conventional MRI for grade III glioma patients.

      VII. Compare predictive capabilities of 18F-DOPA PET, pMRI and diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI) for localization of recurrences for patients treated with 18F-DOPA PET-guided RT dose
      escalation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F DOPA-PET, pMRI, and DTI within 14 days before radiation therapy, 3-6
      weeks after radiation therapy, and during follow-up. Patients also undergo
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) over 30 fractions and receive temozolomide.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5
      years.

    <description>The progression identification timing will be compared by calculating the percentage of time each modality was earlier than conventional MRI. With a sample size of 72, if the observed percentage earlier than conventional MRI is 30% for either modality, a two-sided 95% confidence interval for a single proportion using the large sample normal approximation will be +/- 10.6%. Progression identification timing will also be compared using Kaplan-Meier methods and paired t-tests to determine if differences exist between the modalities.</description>
