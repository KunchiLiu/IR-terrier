    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate genetic causes of early childhood obesity.

      We will enroll children with severe early onset obesity (BMI &gt; 99th percentile) diagnosed
      prior to 6 years of age. We will ask questions about their health, eating behavior and
      perform a brief physical examination. We will collect saliva or blood to perform genetic
      testing. We will also invite family members to participate in the genetic study.

    <textblock>
      This is a clinical and genomic study designed to investigate monogenic causes of severe
      early childhood obesity.

      Subjects with severe early onset obesity attending clinics at Boston Children's Hospital
      will be identified by screening of the clinical database. These subjects will be invited to
      participate in the study. After obtaining informed consent, we will obtain history on the
      proband and the family. We will perform a brief examination and collect genetic material.

      Targeted sequencing of genes associated with monogenic and syndromic forms of obesity will
      be performed using next-generation sequencing at Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA. In selected
      individuals with favorable family history, full exome sequencing will be performed.
      Functional analysis of newly identified variants will be performed where possible.
