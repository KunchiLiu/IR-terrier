      The purpose of this research study is to test whether metformin, a drug commonly used to
      treat diabetes, is able to get rid of atypia (early cell changes that are thought to be a
      marker of breast cancer risk) in women at increased risk for breast cancer. There will be
      testing for the presence of atypia in the breast after metformin is given to see if it can
      get rid of atypia. The study will compare the effects, good and/or bad, of metformin or
      placebo on atypia to find out which is better.

      Note: The standard drug used for the &quot;breast cancer prevention&quot; is tamoxifen. If the patient
      is eligible to take tamoxifen, he/she must be offered tamoxifen prevention as part of
      clinical care. Metformin and tamoxifen are not similar and function differently. This study
      is not investigating the use of tamoxifen. Metformin is not approved for preventing breast
      cancer, but is currently being tested to determine if it can prevent breast cancer.

      A total of 400 premenopausal women (200 per arm) will be pre-registered, among which 300
      patients with atypia (Masood Score 14-17) on random periareolar fine needle aspiration
      (RPFNA) at baseline are expected to be randomized between Metformin and placebo control arm.
      It is expected that the accrual rate will be 5 to 10 patients per month and that accrual
      will be completed about 4 years after study activation. The randomization will be stratified
      for known BRCA mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation vs. no mutation), prior excisional biopsy
      (atypical epithelial hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, flat epithelial hyperplasia
      vs. DCIS vs. LCIS), and baseline fasting insulin &gt; 2x ULN vs. ≤ 2x ULN.

      The primary and secondary objectives are described below.

      Primary Objective:

      • Test for the presence or absence of cytological atypia in RPFNA bilateral aspirates after
      12 and 24 months (24 month is optional for placebo-only group for patients who remain on
      placebo arm and will not receive metformin) for women receiving metformin versus placebo
      control. The presence of cytological atypia means any atypia in any RPFNA specimen.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Use the Masood Cytology Index Score to test for the presence of cytological atypia or
           disappearance of cytological atypia in RPFNA bilateral aspirates after 12 months for
           both arms, and 24 months (24 month is optional for placebo-only group for patients who
           remain on placebo arm and will not receive metformin, and mandatory for crossover
           patients) for women receiving metformin 850 mg PO BID (metformin group).

        -  Compare Masood Cytology Score values at 0 and 12 months in the right and left breasts
           from the same individual in the metformin and placebo groups.

        -  Test the reproducibility of reverse phase protein microarray (RPPM) in duplicate RPPM
           determinations from individual RPFNA specimens.

        -  Correlate baseline RPPM values with presence of atypia (as measured by Masood Cytology
           Index Score) at month 12 and month 24 (month 24 optional for placebo-only group; for
           patients who remain on placebo arm and will not receive metformin) RPFNA.

        -  Determine the change in percent breast density from prior to the initiation of
           metformin or placebo treatment through therapy (ie, at 12 and 24 months), and following
           therapy (ie, 36 and 48 months).

      Follow up visits will be performed at 36 and 48 months after the start of treatment.

               -  A strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer as defined in the study
                  protocol.

               -  Known breast cancer BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier providing that the woman
                  has:

          2. Pre-menopausal women as defined as four menstrual cycles within the last six months
             prior to pre-registration. Women with less than 4 menses within 6 months prior to
             pre-registration or women who have had a hysterectomy with ovaries intact will be
             considered premenopausal if follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level is &lt; 20. Women
             who are using hormonal contraceptives that cause amenorrhea (e.g. injectable and
             extended oral contraceptives, hormone-containing contraceptive ring, or
             hormone-containing intrauterine device) will be considered eligible if they had a
             minimum of 4 menstrual cycles within the last six months prior to starting on the
             contraceptive.

          3. Digital mammogram within 180 days prior to pre-registration.

          4. Mammograms must be read as not suspicious for breast cancer (American College of

             once they have been evaluated by a breast surgeon and there is no evidence of
             invasive malignancy.

          5. Must be non-pregnant and non-lactating for at least one year prior to
             pre-registration.

             Non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix. NOTE: If there is a
             history of prior malignancy, they must not be receiving other specific treatment,
             i.e., other hormonal therapy, for their cancer.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) &lt; 25.

             toxicity of the prescribed regimens.

         11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

         12. Receiving pyrimethamine, cimetidine, rifampin or cephalexin.

         13. Women who have a core biopsy or excisional biopsy containing invasive cancer.
