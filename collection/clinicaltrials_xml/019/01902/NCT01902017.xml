  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injured joints, especially at the elbow, are at risk for permanent motion loss, also known
      as joint contractures. Joint contractures limit the function of an elbow and are a
      recognized complication that occurs often after a traumatic injury. The benefits of early
      motion after injury has helped in preventing joint contractures but there are still several
      patients that develop debilitating joint contractures. Current research suggests that mast
      cells, which are found in the joint, are key in causing joint contractures. Research has
      been done using a medication called Ketotifen. Ketotifen has been linked to stabilizing mast
      cells and preventing the joint contracture. It is hoped that short-term use of this
      medication after an injury will prevent the contracture from occurring.

      Individuals ≥ 18 years old with isolated distal 1/3 humerus and/or proximal 1/3 ulna and/or
      proximal 1/3 radius fractures and/or elbow dislocations (open fractures with or without
      nerve injury may be included) and presenting to Peter Lougheed Centre (PLC). Patients will
      be required to take Ketotifen 5mg by mouth twice a day for 6 weeks or placebo twice a day by
      mouth for 6 weeks. Neither the patient nor the physician caring for you will know if they
      are taking Ketotifen or placebo. Sometimes this type of injury requires surgery. This study
      will be inviting both patients that do and do not require surgery to participate.

      We will take a sample of blood to measure tryptase (normally found in your body). We predict
      people with high levels of tryptase are more likely to develop stiffening in the joint.

      Patients will be asked to return for follow up visits 2, 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks after
      surgery or date of initial injury if surgery is not required. These visits are part of
      normal care for this type of injury.

      At the visit patients will be asked to do the following, some of which is not part of normal
      care.

      At each visit: Range of motion of the elbow will be assessed, DASH score will be completed-
      form helping the research group understand the level of disability from this injury, X-rays
      until the fracture is considered healed (this is normal treatment), SF12 - questionnaire
      about how the patient is feeling and coping with their injury, Additional information will
      be collected about how the injury is healing and weight will be measured.

      The patient will be required to have physiotherapy which is normal treatment for this
      injury.

      The patient will be contacted by telephone for the week 1, 3, 4 and 5 while taking the study
      medication. During these times:

      The patient will be asked about:

        -  any problems with the study medication

        -  any new conditions or concerns that have developed

      The patient will be reminded:

        -  of next visit

        -  to continue to take study drug as instructed

      During these telephone contacts, if any problems are detected that cannot be rectified or
      figured out during the telephone interview, then patients may be asked to attend the Cast
      clinic to see doctor in person.
