  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is common, causing many medical problems in adults (e.g., diabetes, hypertension,
      high cholesterol, sleep apnea, heart attack, strokes). A range of treatments have shown to
      be effective for treating obesity. Treatments include lifestyle modification, meal
      replacements, and weight loss medication. Most primary care settings do not provide much
      obesity treatment, though, as primary care providers (PCPs) are not well trained and because
      reimbursement for treatments is not consistent.

      Hypothesis: If PCPs have training in weight management and if most costs of treatment are
      reimbursed, we surmise that a &quot;toolbox&quot; of treatments can produce a clinically important
      weight loss amount in a large group of patients.

      Design: We propose to establish a registry of obese patients with at least one common
      medical condition related to their weight. From the registry, we will randomly select 350
      people to be offered treatments to assist with weight loss. The remainder of the registry's
      patients can still receive obesity treatment but will not be reimbursed. We will conduct the
      study at Denver Health, a large public health care system that treats a low income,
      ethnically diverse population. All 350 patients will be offered some self-monitoring tools
      for weight management and the chance to do a computer assessment to select the right
      treatment for weight loss. Patients who complete this and record their food intake and
      physical activity for 1 week will be offered a &quot;Level 2&quot; treatment for weight loss. Level 2
      treatments include: a voucher for a commercial weight loss program; intensive group weight
      loss counseling; meal replacements; gym membership; or weight loss medication. Patients will
      choose which treatment they want, with the approval of their PCP. Researchers at Denver
      Health will help with the computer assessment and dispensing the treatments. We are
      interested in what percentage of patients lose at least 5% of their starting weight. We will
      also explore changes in glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and we will look at how
      much this intervention costs and whether patients need less medication for their
      weight-related conditions at the end of the study.

      Impact: If the study is successful, we plan to take the results to the leaders at Denver
      Health to see if they will make obesity treatment more broadly available for all patients
      there.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Obesity is prevalent and is a root cause of many common medical conditions
      affecting U.S. adults. A range of treatment options have demonstrated efficacy in producing
      weight loss and reducing health risks in randomized controlled trials. However, very little
      obesity treatment is currently delivered in most primary care settings. Inadequate
      reimbursement for treatment modalities and a lack of systematic training of primary care
      providers (PCPs) are two of the major barriers to more widespread treatment.

      Hypothesis: If PCPs are given training and support for weight management, and if treatment
      options with proven efficacy are offered to obese adults with weight related co-morbidities
      with the majority of the treatment cost reimbursed, then clinically meaningful weight loss
      will be produced in a significant number of these individuals at a reasonable cost.

      Design: This application proposes a 12 month intervention trial among obese adults cared for
      at 4 primary care clinics affiliated with Denver Health (DH), an integrated health care
      system serving an ethnically diverse medically underserved population. From among a large
      population of patients (~8,000) with obesity and at least one co-morbid condition, 350
      individuals will be randomly selected to be offered a &quot;toolbox&quot; of treatment options. The
      remainder will be assigned to a control condition. The &quot;toolbox&quot; will include: 1) meal
      replacements; 2) group weight loss counseling; 3) membership at recreation centers; 4)
      pharmacotherapy with phentermine; and 5) other options. Patients in the intervention arm
      will undergo an initial evaluation using an &quot;expert systems&quot; computer program. They will
      then be required to self-monitor diet and physical activity before gaining access to the
      higher cost weight management services in the toolbox. Primary care providers will help
      patients choose treatment approaches, encourage adherence, and monitor success. Patient
      Navigators will assist patients in accessing prescribed treatments. The primary outcome will
      be the fraction of patients in each group who achieve a 5% weight loss after 12 months of
      intervention. Secondary outcomes will include uptake and utilization of treatment options,
      changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors, and other health care utilization, in
      particular outpatient medications for diabetes, hypertension, and lipids. While the
      treatment modalities to be used in this trial are not new, an intervention delivering a
      toolbox of weight management services in a safety net clinical setting and examining the
      effect on health care utilization is innovative. The submitted letters of support attest to
      the need for more data so that health care providers and payers can make evidence-based
      decisions regarding the provision of obesity treatment to large patient populations.

      Impact: A positive result would encourage the broader adoption of a toolbox approach to
      weight management in primary care settings. A negative result would strongly suggest that
      even with a &quot;best case scenario&quot; of training and support for obesity treatment, the primary
      care clinic is not an effective route of delivery for weight management. Either result would
      be important in shaping future policy decisions about obesity treatment.

    <description>350 randomly-selected patients at 4 clinics get a &quot;toolbox&quot; of weight loss options, including self-monitoring tools; education materials; recreation center passes; commercial weight loss program (Weight Watchers); intensive group counseling (Colorado Weigh); meal replacements; and obesity pharmacotherapy. The initial assessment, a computer program, takes diet and exercise history and helps patients choose personal treatment goals. Interested patients get a starter kit with self-monitoring tools and meal replacements. Subjects must show self-monitoring of diet and exercise to get more intensive therapies. Patients pay a $5-$10 co-pay for the therapies. They select a primary intensive therapy, but are able to add/change depending on results, adherence and budget availability.</description>
