  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether daptomycin is effective and safe in the
      treatment of pediatric participants with AHO when compared to vancomycin (or equivalent) or
      nafcillin (or β-lactam equivalent).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is a common problem in the pediatric population, affecting
      approximately 5/10,000 children each year and accounting for approximately 1% of all
      pediatric hospitalizations. In children, osteomyelitis arises from bacteremic seeding of the
      bone metaphysis.

      Daptomycin, is a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial active against most clinically significant
      gram-positive pathogens including drug-resistant strains such as Methicillin Resistant
      Staphylococcus (S.) aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin Susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Daptomycin
      has proven clinical efficacy in adults in the treatment of complicated skin and skin
      structure infections (cSSSI) caused by aerobic gram-positive pathogens and the treatment of
      S. aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia; SAB), including those complicated by
      right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by MSSA and MRSA. Although not indicated for
      osteomyelitis, daptomycin has been successfully used to treat osteoarticular infections in
      adults and children as salvage therapy and at medical centers with increasingly high rates
      of vancomycin resistant organisms.

      In addition, more comparative clinical trials are needed in pediatric AHO to better
      elucidate the optimal treatment regimen and clinical response.
