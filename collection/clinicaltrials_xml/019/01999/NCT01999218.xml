  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of ertugliflozin
      (MK-8835/PF-04971729) compared with the addition of glimepiride in participants with T2DM
      who have inadequate glycemic control on metformin. The duration of the trial will be up to
      approximately 122 weeks. This will include a 1-week screening period, an up to 13-week
      wash-off/titration/dose stabilization period, a 2-week placebo run-in period, a 104-week
      double-blind, active comparator-controlled treatment period, and a post-treatment telephone
      contact 14 days after the last dose of study drug. The primary hypothesis of this study is
      that after 52 weeks, the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in participants
      treated with the addition of ertugliflozin 15 mg once daily is non-inferior compared with
      that in participants treated with the addition of glimepiride.
