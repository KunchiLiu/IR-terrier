  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, non-randomized, retrospective study to collect long term (5
      years post-transplant) clinical outcome data to test whether the results of the noninvasive
      immune monitoring test strategy performed in the parent study (CTOT-01, NCT00308802) in
      first six-month post-transplant is predictive of 5-year outcomes. Each center will complete
      a retrospective chart review for the data on patient survival, graft survival and renal
      function.
