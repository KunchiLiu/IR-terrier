  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of the compound[F-18]RGD-K5, when
      used as a tracer during PET (positron emission tomography) imaging, to detect regions of
      unstable atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery of subjects being considered for
      carotid endarterectomy (CEA),and to confirm this ability through histological studies of
      samples of carotid artery plaques that will be collected during the planned carotid surgery.

      Patients will be chosen for the study based on presence of carotid artery stenosis
      ascertained by CTA and carotid artery ultrasound. Patients will receive and intravenous
      injection of the radiolabeled PET tracer,[F-18]RGD-K5, and will undergo PET imaging of their
      carotid arteries bilaterally. PET images will be analyzed to determine the standard uptake
      value (SUV) of [F-18]RGD-K5 uptake by the carotid artery plaque and this will be compared to
      the SUV of the background (blood pool in the aorta). This will be expressed as a target to
      background ratio (TBR). Investigators expect to find a significant uptake of [F-18]RGD-K5 by
      carotid artery palque and investigators therefore expect to find a TBR that is significantly
      &gt;1. Investigators also expect to find that plaque from patients who show a TBR &gt;1 will also
      be enriched for histologic markers for inflammation and angiogenesis.

    <description>To assess uptake of [F-18]RGD-K5 by carotid plaque with PET/CT imaging (which will be expressed as a target to background ratio (TBR) of the standard uptake value (SUV)) in participants prior to carotid endarterectomy. The TBR of [F-18]RGD-K5 in the plaque will serve as a surrogate marker of plaque inflammation in participants being considered for carotid endarterectomy.</description>

    <description>In order to document that this tracer, [F-18]RGD-K5, is safe for clinical use in plaque imaging, patients will be contacted 24h after receiving the [F-18]RGD-K5. They will be questioned about any side effects or adverse events they might have experienced during that time after receiving the tracer.</description>

          -  Participant is capable of complying with study procedures

          -  Participant has known carotid artery stenosis of &gt;50% luminal diameter based on
             carotid ultrasound or computed tomography angiography (CTA), as stated in official
