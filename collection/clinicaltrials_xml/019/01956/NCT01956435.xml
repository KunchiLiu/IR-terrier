    <textblock>
      This pilot study will consist of 10 adult subjects with symmetric idiopathic guttate
      hypomelanosis on the lower legs. Subjects will be randomized to which extremity (right or
      left) will be treated. Treatments with the Xtrac Excimer laser will be performed twice
      weekly for 12 weeks using the typical vitiligo protocol. Our goal is to determine the
      effectiveness of excimer laser for repigmentation of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis.
      Effectiveness will be graded by the blinded observer scale via photographic comparisons and
      will be graded by subject via survey every 4 weeks.

      Methods: This pilot study will consist of 10 adult subjects with symmetric IGH on the lower
      legs. After enrollment, 5 lesions of IGH on each leg will be selected by either Dr. Jennifer
      Gordon or Dr. Ammar Ahmed and marked. Subjects will be randomized to which extremity (right
      or left) will be treated. Treatments with the Xtrac Excimer laser (wavelength of 308nm) will
      be performed twice weekly for 12 weeks using the typical vitiligo protocol (see Appendix C).
      Photographs of both extremities will be taken prior to initial treatment and then every 4
      weeks. The photographs will be analyzed by two separate, blinded dermatologists and rated on
      improvement from baseline using the following scale: 1= worsening of IGH; 2= no improvement
      (IGH remained stable); 3= mild improvement of IGH (some repigmentation on &lt;50% IGH); 4=
      moderate improvement (some repigmentation on &gt;50% or full repigmentation on &lt;75% IGH); 5=
      full repigmentation on &gt;75% IGH (see Appendix A). Subjects will also be asked to complete
      this survey subjectively every 4 weeks. Internal control will be represented by the marked
      lesions on the non-treated extremity of each patient. Control versus treatment groups will
      be statistically compared; however, due to the limited number of patient in this pilot
      study, a descriptive trend analysis will likely be completed. Subjects will be compensated
      $10 per visit (totaling $250). If a subject withdraws early from the study, they will be
      compensated for every completed visit. The 25th visit will consist of final photographs and
      surveys, and will not include treatment.

      Statistical Analysis: The main outcomes to be collected are the improvement of IGH from
      baseline at weeks 4, 8 and 12 by the blinded dermatologists and by the subjects. Subjects
      will be stratified by Fitzpatrick skin type for analysis as well.
