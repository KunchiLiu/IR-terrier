      We will evaluate the end to end remote monitoring system in a less controlled environment
      and concurrently develop the infrastructure to support the back end of the system

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of our research is to test, adapt, refine and validate the
      BodyGuardian technology and related end-to-end remote monitoring system to be used outside
      usual medical care environments to reduce hospital readmissions and facilitate independent
      living for HF patients. An important component of our overall strategy for continued
      development and refinement of the remote monitoring system is the incorporation of iterative
      behavioral evaluations to facilitate assessment and refinement in order to optimize
      adherence, utilization, and usability for patients as well as efficiency and functionality
      for providers.
