    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the program's effectiveness in a primary care setting in
      reducing stigma among medical personnel, increasing the comfort level of physicians and
      staff in providing care to those living with mental illness, and in improving client
      well-being and mental health.

      Skill-based approaches are effective in reducing stigma in health professionals

      Objective: Review skill-based approaches to reducing stigma in health professionals

      Overview: The NS Department of Health and Wellness and the Mental Health Commission of
      Canada launched a demonstration project in Nova Scotiaâ€”Adult Mental Health Practice Support
      Program. Originating in British Columbia, it uses a novel learning platform which supports
      primary healthcare providers with treatment and management of mental illness. We
      hypothesized that enhanced skills in program participants would lead to increased comfort on
      the part of practitioners, diminished social distance and stigmatization.

      Methods: 110 NS family physicians and their office staff were assigned to intervention or
      control group in a double blind, parallel-cluster RCT to determine program's impact on
      stigma, comfort level providing mental illness treatment, clinical outcomes, and economics.
      Intervention group participants attended 3 half-day workshops with a &quot;6-week action period&quot;
      between workshops to practice learnings. Practice support was provided through diagnostic
      assessment tools, evidence based self-management tools, and on-site practice support
      coordinator support.

      Results: We will review impact on stigma, comfort level providing mental illness treatment,
      clinical outcomes, economics, best practice integration approaches contributing to programs
      feasibility and sustainability.

      Conclusion: Reducing stigma is key to improved patient care, and greater collaboration
      between the formal mental health and primary care system. Skill-based strategies can be a
      promising approach to diminish stigma in health care providers. These results will encourage
      a broader adoption of the program provincially and nationally.

    <description>The PHQ-9, developed by Drs. Robert L. Spitzer, Janet B.W. Williams specifically for primary care settings is a self-report instrument which takes only a few minutes to complete. The tool covers the nine symptom-based Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4th edition (DSM-IV), and DSM-5 criteria for major depression. It can also produce dimensional symptom severity ratings. The scale covers a two week time frame, essentially covering current rather than past episodes. The PHQ-9 has been extensively validated and is widely used in primary care as a screening instrument and for monitoring treatment outcomes. A PHQ-9 score &gt;10 has a sensitivity for major depression of 88%, and a specificity of 88%, and a positive likelihood ratio of 7.1.</description>

    <measure>Lam's Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2,3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>As a measure of occupational functioning, Lam's Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS) will be used . This scale was developed in Canada to assess the workplace impact of major depression. LEAPS displayed excellent internal consistency as assessed by Cronbach's alpha: 0.89. During scale development, validity was assessed by comparing the LEAPS to the other clinical and work functioning scales, where it showed excellent concordant validity.</description>

    <description>The Opening Minds Scale, Health Professionals (OMS-HC) is a 20-item scale assessing social distance, negative attitudes and willingness to disclose. The scale is designed to assess mental illness stigmatization in health care professionals.</description>
