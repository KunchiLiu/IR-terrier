      The Cardiovascular Health Program (CHP) Registry seeks to improve the cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) risk profile of subjects through therapeutic lifestyle change using an integrative
      model of medicine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through improvements in lifestyle choices regarding diet, exercise, sleep and stress
      management, the CHP Registry expects to find improvements in calculated risk for heart
      disease and stroke.

      Upon entry to the CHP Registry, subjects are given a detailed assessment of CVD risk through
      their reported past medical history, family history, review of systems, physical
      examination, laboratory data including lipid profile and glucose metabolism,
      electrocardiogram and/or exercise stress test, and carotid ultrasound for intima-medial
      thickness. Framingham risk score is calculated and in combination with other factors, a
      global score for CVD risk is appraised.

      Subjects then attend a half-day workshop on heart healthy behaviors including a cooking
      demonstration that promulgates a Mediterranean Diet. At approximately monthly intervals over
      a 6-month timeframe, subjects consult in 20 minute onsite appointments with a dietician,
      exercise physiologist, and stress management coach to work on behavioral improvements to
      encourage heart health. These onsite visits are then followed by 6 months of telephonic
      lifestyle coaching.

      At program's end, typically 12 months after enrollment in the Registry, subjects repeat
      their CVD risk assessment to receive a personal report card detailing the results of their
      therapeutic lifestyle changes.

    <description>Specific dietary behaviors are surveyed using the Rate-Your-Plate Dietary Assessment Tool with scores for each behavior ranging from 0 to 3. A high score indicates a healthy dietary behavior. All individual scores are added to calculate an overall score for healthful eating.</description>

    <description>In receiving recommendations for a Mediterranean-style diet, subjects are encouraged to get protein predominantly from fish and legumes, fat from olive oil or other sources high in omega-3 oils, to eat whole grains and complex carbohydrates while avoiding highly processed foods. Subjects are also coached on portion control, stress-eating and snacking, aiming for adequate water intake, and eating meals including breakfast with regularity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: The CHP Registry is a clinical program available to any adult (age 18
        years or older) military health care beneficiary. Subjects who present to the CHP for
        evaluation and participation may be self-referred or be referred by a provider. A majority
        of participants are free of cardiovascular disease symptoms. Participants elect to enroll
        in order to learn about healthy lifestyle choices that can help prevent the development of
        cardiovascular disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Less than 18 years of age.

          2. Individuals unable or unwilling to participate or give informed consent.
