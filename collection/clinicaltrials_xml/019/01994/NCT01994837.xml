        Inclusion Criteria: 1. Histological or cytological confirmation of relapsed or refractory
        AML (by World Health Organization (WHO) classification) or untreated AML in patients who
        are unfit for intensive therapy.

        2. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score of 0 to 2.

        3. Subject must have adequate renal function as demonstrated by a calculated creatinine
        clearance â‰¥ 50 mL/min; determined via urine collection for 24-hour creatinine clearance or
        by the Cockcroft Gault formula using ideal body mass (IBM) instead of mass.

        4. Subject must have adequate liver function. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Subject has received
        acute anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal or
        any investigational therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to
        first dose of ABT-199.

        2. Subject has received a monoclonal antibody for anti-neoplastic intent within 8 weeks
        prior to the first dose of study drug.

        3. Subject has received Potent CYP3A inducers (such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin
        and St. John's wort and Warfarin or requires the use of warfarin (due to potential
        drug-drug interactions that may potentially increase the exposure of warfarin and
        complications of this effect) within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

        4. Subject has received CYP3A inhibitors (such as fluconazole, ketoconazole, and
        clarithromycin) within 5 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

        5. Subject has a white blood cell count &gt; 25 x 10^9/L. 6. Subject has acute promyelocytic
        leukemia (French-American-British Class M3 AML).

        7. Subjects with known active CNS disease.
