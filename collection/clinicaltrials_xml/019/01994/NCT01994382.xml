    <textblock>
      This study will identify the highest dose, and assess the safety, of cerdulatinib
      (PRT062070) that may be given in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia or non-hodgkin lymphoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2a, multi dose, multi-center trial of orally administered
      cerdulatinib assessing safety, tolerability and PK parameters conducted in 2 phases:

        -  Phase 1: Dose-escalation portion, during which 52 patients enrolled to receive a
           single-agent cerdulatinib at their assigned dose level starting at 15 mg QD,
           administered in increasing doses until the MTD/MAD is identified.

        -  Phase 2a: Consisting of 6 planned cohorts of 40 patients by cancer type. Five cohorts
           will receive single agent cerdulatinib at a starting dose of 35 mg BID for 28 days
           escalated to 40 mg BID in the absence of a Grade 3 or higher toxicity. Cohort 2
           receives cerdulatinib plus rituximab IV at 375 mg/m2.
