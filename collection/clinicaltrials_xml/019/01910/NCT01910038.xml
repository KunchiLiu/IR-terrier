  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The usual percentage of patients receiving 0.1 mg/Kg/d or less of prednisone after 6 months
      of treatment is approximately 40%. We believe that adding tocilizumab to the corticotherapy
      in this protocol could increase the percentage from 40 to 70%.

      From an immunological point of view, we believe we will see not only a fall in the Th17
      response (as with corticoids alone), but also a rise in Treg lymphocytes.
