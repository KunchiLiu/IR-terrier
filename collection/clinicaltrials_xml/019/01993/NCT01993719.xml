  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white
           blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and
           then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating
           Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 400 patients with
           melanoma.

        -  In this trial, we are determining if there is a difference in the response between
           patients who have received prior anti-PD1 treatment to those who have not received this
           prior ant-PD1 treatment.

      Objectives:

      - To determine if there is a difference in the rate of response between patients who have
      received prior anti-PD1 and those who have not.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years of age who have
      metastatic melanoma.

      Design:

        -  Work up stage: Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.
           Blood and urine samples will be collected.

        -  Surgery: Surgery or biopsy will be performed to obtain tumor from which to grow white
           blood cells. White blood cells will be grown from the tumor in the laboratory.

        -  Leukapheresis: Participants will have leukapheresis to collect additional white blood
           cells. (Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells
           from the patient.)

        -  Treatment: Participants will receive standard dose chemotherapy to prepare their immune
           system to accept the white blood cells. Participants will receive an infusion of their
           own white blood cells grown from tumor. They will also receive aldesleukin for up to
           five days to boost the immune system s response to the white blood cells. They will
           stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

        -  Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side
           effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every
           6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2
           days.

      Background:

        -  Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can mediate
           the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered along with high-dose
           aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy
           preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  In a series of consecutive trials using this chemotherapy preparative regimen alone or
           with 2 Gy or 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) objective response rates using RECIST
           criteria were 49%, 52%, and 72%, respectively. Of the 20 complete regressions seen in
           this trial, 19 are on-going at 70 to 114 months.

        -  The chemotherapy alone preparative regimen required in-patient treatment and was
           associated with significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia requiring multiple
           transfusions and treatment for febrile neutropenia.

      Objectives:

        -  With amendment D, to determine if there is a difference in the rate of response between
           patients who have received prior anti-PD1 and those who have not; both groups will
           receive non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen followed by autologous
           young TIL and administration of high dose aldesleukin.

        -  To determine the toxicity of the treatment.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 70 years

        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma

        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL

        -  No contraindications to high-dose aldesleukin administration

        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency

      Design:

        -  Patients with metastatic melanoma will have lesions resected and after TIL growth is
           established, patients will receive ACT with TIL plus aldesleukin following high dose
           chemotherapy preparative regimen.

        -  Up to 64 patients may be enrolled over 4-5 years.

             be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.

          4. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to 70 years of age.

          5. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign the Informed Consent

          9. Serology:

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus are less responsive
                  to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody.
                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

         10. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

                  s Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.

         13. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients toxicities must have
             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo).
             Patients must have progressive disease after prior treatment.

             Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks,
             as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.

         14. Four weeks must have elapsed from the time of any antibody therapy that could affect
             an anti cancer immune response, at the time the patient receives the preparative
             regimen to allow antibody levels to decline.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          2. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          3. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          4. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a
