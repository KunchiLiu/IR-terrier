  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the number of Veteran suffering from Mild
      traumatic brain(MTBI) injury and PTSD increases rapidly. Headache is one of the most
      debilitating clinical symptoms in Veteran with MTBI and the cause of it is still not
      entirely clear. Recently, the use of non-invasive brain stimulation such as repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS) has yielded favorable clinical outcome in a few
      intractable chronic central pain conditions including headaches. This study aims to 1)
      assess the effect of rTMS in relieving headache and improving neurophysiological functions;
      and 2)explore the neuronal mechanisms associated with MTBI related headache and the
      analgesic effect of rTMS with function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
