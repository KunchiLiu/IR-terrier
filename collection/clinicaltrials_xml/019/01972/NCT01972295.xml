    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, non-randomized, multicenter study with the following
      objectives: (1) to compile real-world clinical outcomes data for WATCHMAN Left Atrial
      Appendage Closure Technology in patients who are implanted with the WATCHMAN device in a
      commercial clinical setting and (2) to collect health care usage data that may be needed for
      reimbursement of WATCHMAN technology in certain countries.

      Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in the study. To reduce the impact of individual
      center bias, each site may include up to 45 subjects and each country may included a maximum
      of 150 patients. Up to 10 sites in the Asia Pacific region will participate.

      Primary analyses may include, but will not be limited to, the following: procedural
      complications, incidence of stroke and death. Descriptive statistics will be used for
      baseline, procedure and follow-up data collected through the study.

      Each patient will be followed for a period of two years after implant according to the
      schedule and standard practice at the enrolling centers. There will be no additional visits,
      nor procedures, for subjects who participate in the study. Subjects are expected to be
      followed at implant, then at one post-implant visit (typically between 1-3 months of
      implant), and then annually through 2 years post implant. An intermediate visit may be
      scheduled in a number of patients, per physician discretion. In order to reliably capture
      patient status at study end, a follow-up window of 24 +/- 3 months will be considered
      acceptable for scheduling the last visit. For subjects who are not scheduled to visit the
      clinical for a follow-up, a subject contact (e.g. phone call) will ensure capture of the
      endpoint related information; however, it is recommended to perform an in-office visit for
      at least the first annual visit.

      Enrollment is expected to be completed in 21 months; therefore the total study duration is
      estimated to be 48 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are eligible for a WATCHMAN device according to current international
             and local guidelines (and future revisions) and per physician discretion;

          -  Patients who are willing and capable of providing informed consent, participating in
             all testing associated with this clinical investigation at an approved clinical
             investigational center;

          -  Patients whose age is 18 years or above, or of legal age to give informed consent
             specific to state and national law.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
             would directly interfere with the current study, except when the patient is
             participating in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational
             registry with no associated treatments. Each instance should be brought to the
             attention of the sponsor to determine eligibility.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are, or plan to become, pregnant during the time
             of the study (method of assessment upon physician's discretion);

          -  The subject is unable or not willing to complete follow-up visits and examination for
             the duration of the study.
