    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and patient
      reported quality of life of Herceptin (trastuzumab) subcutaneous therapy in patients with
      HER2-positive early breast cancer in routine clinical practice. Data from eligible patients
      will be collected for the duration of their treatment (approximately 1 year) and for 1-2
      years of follow-up.
