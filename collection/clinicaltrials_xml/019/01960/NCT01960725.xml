    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of pentavalent rotavirus
      vaccine (RV5) when administered according to an alternate dosing schedule (2-5 weeks, 2
      months and 4 months). In this interventional, open-label study, infants 2 through 5 weeks of
      age (14 to 41 days) will be enrolled and vaccinated with RV5 according to a 2-5 week, 2 and
      4 month schedule and infants 2 months of age (56 to 83 days) will be vaccinated according to
      the standard recommended schedule (2, 4, and 6 months of age). Sera will be obtained from
      subjects one month following the final dose of vaccine and will be assayed for
      anti-rotavirus IgA and rotavirus neutralizing antibody responses against the G1, G2, G3, G4
      and P[8] serotypes. Post dose 3 G1 serum-neutralizing antibody (SNA) geometric mean titers
      (GMTs) will be compared between children receiving pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5)
      according to the alternate dosing schedule versus the standard recommended schedule.
      Likewise, post dose 3 G2, G3, G4 and P[8] SNA and serum rotavirus IgA GMTs will be compared
      between children receiving RV5 according to the alternate dosing schedule and the standard
      recommended schedule. The safety and tolerability of RV5 in children receiving vaccine
      according to the alternate dosing schedule will be described.
