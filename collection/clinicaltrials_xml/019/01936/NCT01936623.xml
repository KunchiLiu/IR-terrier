  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a computerized brief intervention for
      moderate risk drug use among adult primary care patients is more effective than providing
      such patients with a substance abuse assessment alone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 80 adult primary care patients who have moderate risk drug use.
      Eligible participants (N = 80) will be randomly assigned to immediately receive a
      computerized brief intervention focused on drug use or to receive the same computerized
      brief intervention at 3-month follow-up. All participants will be assessed at three time
      points: baseline, and at 3 and 6 month follow-ups.
