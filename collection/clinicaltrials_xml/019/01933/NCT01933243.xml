      Adolescents with anorexia nervosa frequently have associated anxiety, and standard
      medications used for anxiety are unhelpful when patients are malnourished. This is a 12 week
      trial examining the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of fish oil nutritional
      supplements for anxiety in adolescents with anorexia nervosa.

    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder characterized by a morbid fear of weight gain
      and a perception of being overweight despite objective evidence of weight loss and
      malnutrition. It has been estimated that almost 0.9% of women will suffer from AN at some
      point in their lives, and most cases of AN arise during adolescence. Even with appropriate
      treatment, only about half of patients with AN will have a full recovery, 30% partial
      recovery, and 20% will progress to having a chronic illness. Earlier, more aggressive
      treatment with appropriate nutritional recovery during adolescence offers the best chance of
      a full recovery. Treatment of AN is complicated by the high rate of comorbid psychiatric
      diagnoses, the physical and cognitive effects of the attendant malnutrition, and the lack of
      effective pharmacologic interventions. Approximately 75% of patients with AN have a comorbid
      psychiatric illness, including depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and anxiety.
      Anxiety disorders in particular share attributes with AN, including perfectionism, rigidity,
      compulsivity, and harm avoidance in addition to trait anxiety. Complicating treatment, the
      risk and severity of patients' anxiety is enhanced by a lower body mass index (BMI), and
      this low BMI is the likely reason why standard medication treatments for generalized
      anxiety, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are ineffective. In order to
      address these treatment challenges, we propose to study the tolerability, feasibility and
      efficacy of a non-pharmacologic interventions for anxiety in adolescents with AN: omega-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation.

      Over the past 15 years, there has been an interest in possible associations between fish oil
      and affective illness, particularly depression. Low plasma levels of docosahexaenoic acid,
      an essential fatty acid found in fish oil, are associated with low concentrations of
      cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), a marker of central nervous system
      serotonin turnover. Epidemiologically, those populations with higher fish oil consumption
      tend to have lower rates of depression, and reported low levels of fish consumption have
      been associated with a greater risk of depression in women. It has been hypothesized that
      omega-3 PUFAs alter brain phospholipid composition and enhance membrane fluidity, and this
      is supported by evidence that supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs decreases brain water
      proton transverse relaxation times in patients with bipolar disorder. The association with
      depression and the proposed mechanism of action elicited some interest regarding
      associations between omega-3 PUFAs and anxiety disorders. Supplementation trials have shown
      mixed results, with no effects for obsessive compulsive disorder in patients taking maximum
      doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and another showing decreased anxiety
      symptoms in 22 patients enrolled in a substance abuse treatment program. Recently,
      Kiecolt-Glaser and colleagues described a decrease in test-related anxiety symptoms in a
      non-clinical sample of medical students related to supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs.
      Although there has been some interest in the use of omega-3 PUFA supplementation as an
      adjunctive treatment for anorexia nervosa, there have been no systematic trials.
