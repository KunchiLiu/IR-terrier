  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As children with cerebral palsy (CP) become teenagers, they experience a decrease in their
      physical function and mobility. Decreased mobility leads to increased social isolation for
      the teens and impacts negatively on their quality of life. This loss of function is
      multifactorial, but poor physical fitness and muscle weakness secondary to disuse are
      significant contributors. Exercise video games are a novel approach to engage youth in
      physical exercise and social interaction with their peers. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the impact of an exercise video gaming intervention to improve physical fitness and
      social wellbeing. Our over-arching research questions are whether &quot;exergames&quot; can provide
      health benefits (improved physical fitness) and improved social wellbeing in youth with CP.

      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the impact of exergaming on
      cardiovascular fitness and social wellbeing related to friends/peers in youths with CP. The
      secondary objectives of the study will be to evaluate the impact of the exergaming
      intervention on additional components of physical fitness including anaerobic fitness, and
      muscle strength. In addition, the effect of the exergaming intervention on overall
      health-related quality of life (HRQL), self-esteem and motor participation will also be
      measured. Finally, the effectiveness of a technique for balancing performance in multiplayer
      exergames will be evaluated. The objectives will be investigated using a randomized
      crossover study design.Outcomes will be measured a total of four times: at study entry and
      after the first ten-week period (either comparison or intervention), at the end of a
      six-week washout period, then again after second period (either intervention or comparison).
      Outcomes will be assessed by physiotherapists and research staff members who will be blinded
      to the condition of the participants.

    <description>The 7.5m Shuttle Run test (SRT-III) is a maximal, running-based, field test that can assess cardiovascular fitness in children with CP GMFCS level III. In the tests, markers are placed 7.5m apart in a square formation. Participants walk from marker to marker according to progressively faster auditory cues from a music device.</description>

        <description>The 7.5m Shuttle Run test (SRT-III) is a maximal, running-based, field test that can assess cardiovascular fitness in children with CP GMFCS level III. In the tests, markers are placed 7.5m apart in a square formation. Participants walk from marker to marker according to progressively faster auditory cues from a music device.</description>

            <description>In this arm, the participants will participate in the exergaming intervention.
Exergaming Intervention: The exergaming system will be installed into the participants' homes. Players will pedal the exergame bike in order to move their game avatar. Headsets allow players to communicate with each other in real-time. Participants will play the games 3 to 5 times per week, during scheduled game times. Players will wear a heart rate (HR) monitor and will achieve game benefits for reaching their target HR. They will be asked to exercise in a target HR zone of 40-65%HR reserve. Each week, participants will receive a call from a research assistant (RA), who will provide feedback on their exercise progress and a HR goal for each week. The RA will also record physical and social activities engaged in and any difficulties like leg pain or technical issues.</description>
