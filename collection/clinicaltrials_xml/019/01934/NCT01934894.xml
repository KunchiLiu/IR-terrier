  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial will combine two agents, cabazitaxel and lapatinib, to treat patients
      with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which has metastasized to the brain. The first portion
      of the study will determine the optimal dose of the cabazitaxel/lapatinib combination to
      administer to patients. After determining the optimal dose, patients will continue treatment
      with cabazitaxel and lapatinib to assess response to treatment with these agents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase II study with a lead-in safety cohort. Through
      the safety lead-in portion of this trial we will define the optimal dose of cabazitaxel when
      given in combination with lapatinib for patients with HER2-positive MBC and CNS metastases.
      The Phase II portion will further assess intracranial response rate in patients with
      HER2-positive MBC and CNS metastases. Toxicity and progression free survival (PFS) will be
      obtained and evaluated. The trial will be conducted at multiple study sites by SCRI
      Development Innovations.
