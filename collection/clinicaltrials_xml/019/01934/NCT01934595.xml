      It is well accepted that during critical illness there is an increase in protein breakdown
      and loss of lean body mass. Previous studies have shown that during critical illness muscle
      breakdown increases dramatically. The aim of our study is to test the hypothesis that
      critically ill patients have improved outcomes with higher protein supplementation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Medical or surgical patients who are admitted or transferred to the ICU with an
             APACHE II score greater than or equal to 18 and who are candidates for enteral
             nutrition within 48 hours of admission.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Patients who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition

               -  Patients who have a contraindication for enteral nutrition per American Society
                  of Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition guidelines (GI obstruction, intractable
                  nausea and/or vomiting, short bowel syndrome, distal GI fistula, GI bleeding
                  that will require endoscopy, malabsorption that requires TPN, inability to
                  access the GI tract

               -  Patients with chronic stage III or IV kidney disease and/or patients receiving
                  dialysis within six months of this hospital admission as these patients are
                  known to require specific protein diets as an outpatient. Patients with acute
                  kidney injury will not be excluded as there is no evidence to suggest these
                  patients require a specific protein diet secondary to their acute kidney injury.

               -  Patients with refractory hypotension unresponsive to vasoactive medications

               -  Patients who are unlikely to survive the next 48 hours at the time of enrollment
                  (this will be judged by the treating physician)

               -  Patients who are unable to give consent and do not have a family member able to
                  give consent on his/her behalf.

               -  Patients with end stage liver disease or undergoing liver transplant or liver
                  resection surgery

               -  Patients whose physician thinks he/she should not participate

               -  Prisoners

               -  Pregnant women (all female of childbearing age will have a urine pregnancy test
                  prior to randomization)
