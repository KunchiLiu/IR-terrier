    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI is a participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24, and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-F score was calculated according to a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at Weeks 24 and 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>PSQI is a questionnaire with 18 questions to assess sleep quality. The 18 questions are distributed to 7 elements (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction). A participant indicates how frequently each item was experienced on a scale from 0 to 3. The global score is the sum score of all 7 elements and ranges from 0-21 with higher values indicating worse sleep quality. A score of &gt;/=5 indicates poor sleepers.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The CDAI is the numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) based on a 28-joint assessment, patient's global assessment of disease activity (PtGDA) and physician global assessment of disease activity (PGDA) assessed on 0-10 centimeter (cm) visual analogue scale (VAS). Higher scores represent greater affection due to disease activity. CDAI total score = 0-76. CDAI score less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 2.8 indicates disease remission, greater than (&gt;) 2.8 to 10 indicates low disease activity, &gt;10 to 22 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 indicates high disease activity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 24</title>
          <description>The CDAI is the numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) based on a 28-joint assessment, patient's global assessment of disease activity (PtGDA) and physician global assessment of disease activity (PGDA) assessed on 0-10 centimeter (cm) visual analogue scale (VAS). Higher scores represent greater affection due to disease activity. CDAI total score = 0-76. CDAI score less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 2.8 indicates disease remission, greater than (&gt;) 2.8 to 10 indicates low disease activity, &gt;10 to 22 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 indicates high disease activity.</description>

        <description>The CDAI is the numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGDA and PGDA assessed on 0-10 cm VAS. Higher scores represent greater affection due to disease activity. CDAI total score = 0-76. CDAI score &lt;/=2.8 indicates disease remission.</description>

        <description>DAS28-ESR is calculated from the TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in millimeters per hour (mm/hour) and PtGDA assessed on 0-10 cm VAS. Higher scores indicate greater affection due to disease activity. DAS28-ESR total score= 0-9.4. DAS28-ESR &lt;/=3.2 indicates low disease activity, DAS28-ESR &gt;3.2 to 5.1 indicates moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-ESR &lt;/=3.2 indicates remission.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI is a participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

        <description>The FACIT-F score was calculated according to a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).</description>

        <description>PSQI is a questionnaire with 18 questions to assess sleep quality. The 18 questions are distributed to 7 elements (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction). A participant indicates how frequently each item was experienced on a scale from 0 to 3. The global score is the sum score of all 7 elements and ranges from 0-21 with higher values indicating worse sleep quality. A score of &gt;/=5 indicates poor sleepers.</description>
