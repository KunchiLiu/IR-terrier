  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disorder that adversely affects most
      aspects of everyday life in majority of patients. It has a prevalence of up to 3-4% of
      adults and up to 25% among children. AD has a complex pathogenesis, characterized by: 1)
      immune activation with increased numbers of T-cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and increased
      expression of inflammatory molecules 2) marked epidermal hyperplasia in chronic diseased
      skin, and 3) defective barrier function with increased trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and
      decreased lipids, reflecting underlying alterations in keratinocyte differentiation. AD is
      predominantly a Th2 (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31) disease, and recently was also found to be a
      &quot;T22&quot; (IL-22) polarized disease.

      ILV-094 is an anti IL-22 antibody and therefore should reverse the immune activation of AD.
      This study is being done to assess the safety, tolerability, clinical efficacy, and
      mechanism of action of ILV-094 in patients with AD.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of six IV infusions of ILV-094
      administered to subjects with atopic dermatitis. Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned in
      a 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatments arms (ILV-094 vs placebo). Forty patients will be
      enrolled in the ILV-094 treatment arm and 20 in the placebo-treatment arm, accordingly. A
      loading IV dose of 600 mg of ILV-094 or placebo will be given at baseline (Day 0), followed
      by five additional IV doses of 300 mg of ILV-094 or placebo every two weeks (Weeks 2, 4, 6,
      8, and 10). We will continue to follow the patients every two weeks for an additional 10
      weeks after the last IV dose (20 weeks post baseline).

                  bactrim, cephalosporins, etc) and or topical immune modulators
                  (protopic/elidel).

               -  Category 2: Systemic Steroids and/or Phototherapy.

               -  Category 3: Cyclosporine and/or Other Immunomodulators (Methotrexate, CellCept,

             birth control measures that are highly effective.

          -  Are PPD negative at the time of screening.

          -  Willingness to avoid alcohol intake 48 hours before each visit in which study drug
             will be received, in order to avoid increases in liver function tests (LFTs) (this
             was an exclusion in other ILV-094 studies in order to guard against increased LFTs
             due to alcohol intake being attributed to study drug).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of active or latent serious infections (TB, or other granulomatous disorders
             such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, etc). Skin colonization by Staph. aureus
             is expected in a high percentage of atopic patients with active disease and will not
             be considered as an exclusion criteria.

          -  Have a known malignancy or history of malignancy (except for basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma completely excised without evidence of recurrence and treated carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix) or lymphoproliferative diseases

          -  Have a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection or opportunistic systemic infection
             (e.g., Pneumocystis carinii, and aspergillosis) within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Have positive HIV by history or POCT on the screening visit.

          -  Have documented current active hepatitis B (surface antigen positive or asymptomatic
             chronic carriers) or a history of hepatitis C infection (anti-HCV positive), by
             history and/or screening test.

          -  Have a history of substance abuse (drug or alcohol) within the past year before
             screening.

          -  Have a serious concomitant illness that could require the use of systemic
             corticosteroids or otherwise interfere with the patient's participation in the trial.

          -  Pregnant women or women that are breast feeding or plan to breast feed.

          -  Evidence of acute or unstable clinically significant disease or any unstable serious
             disorder requiring active frequent monitoring.

          -  Evidence of other concomitant skin conditions (eg, psoriasis, or lupus erythematosus)
             other than atopic dermatitis that would interfere with evaluations of the effect of
             study medication on atopic dermatitis.

          -  Use of any investigational small molecule drug within 90 days before the first dose
             of test article administration.

          -  Have a transplanted organ (with the exception of a corneal transplant performed &gt;3
             months prior to screening).

          -  Have concomitant autoimmune disease

          -  Clinically important deviation from normal limits in physical examination, vital sign
             measurements, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), or clinical laboratory tests
             results, not associated with a chronic, well-controlled medical condition. Examples
             of these deviations include following:

               1. Undiagnosed hypertension.

               2. Evidence of undiagnosed ischemic heart disease or potentially clinically
                  significant arrhythmia on ECG.

               3. Hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dl

               4. WBC count &lt; 3.5 x 109 cells/L

               5. Neutrophils &lt;1 x 109 cells/L

               6. Platelets &lt; 100 x 109 cells/L

               7. AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT levels above 2 times the upper limit of normal for the
                  laboratory conducting the test.

               8. Alkaline phosphatase levels above 2 times the upper limit of normal for the
                  laboratory conducting the test.

          -  Live vaccines within 3 months before test article administration or during the study.
