    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and assess the safety,
      tolerability and activity of carfilzomib given in combination with carboplatin and etoposide
      as initial therapy for subjects with Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer (ES SCLC).

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of extensive-stage small-cell
             lung cancer (ES-SCLC) with measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1; ES-SCLC is defined as: small-cell lung cancer
             (SCLC) that has spread beyond one hemithorax and regional lymph nodes on the same
             side (e.g., supraclavicular) to the contralateral hemithorax, lymph nodes, or more
             distant locations in the body

          2. Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastases or other central nervous system (CNS)
             disease at screening/diagnosis are eligible

          3. Males and females ≥ 18 years of age

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous systemic therapy to treat small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Subjects with
             recurrent or progressive limited-stage SCLC after previous systemic treatment are not
             eligible for study participation.

          2. Whole brain or focal radiation therapy within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1)

          3. Congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III to IV),
             symptomatic ischemia, conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by conventional
             intervention, or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to prior to C1D1 for
             Phase 1b or prior to randomization for Phase 2
