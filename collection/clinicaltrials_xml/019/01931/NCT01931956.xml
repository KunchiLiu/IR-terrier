      Prospective, multicenter, continued access registry of the MitraClip® Cardiovascular Valve
      Repair System in the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation. Clinical follow-up at
      discharge, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, and 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-years. The study consists of
      two arms: a high risk group and a non-high risk group. Enrollment in high risk arm is
      ongoing. Enrollment in non-high risk arm concluded in April 2011.

      The EVEREST II REALISM study (REALISM study) is a continued access registry designed for
      continued data collection on the use of Abbott Vascular's MitraClip System (MitraClip®
      Device) under more &quot;real world&quot; conditions. After the completion of enrollment in the
      pivotal EVEREST II Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and EVEREST II High Risk Registry
      Study, continued access to the technology was warranted to collect additional safety and
      effectiveness data on the MitraClip® Device. This continued access study was approved by FDA
      on November 21, 2008 (G030064). There are two arms (High Risk and Non-High Risk) in the
      REALISM study. Enrollment in the Non-High Risk arm of the study concluded on April 14, 2011
      and enrollment in the High Risk arm concluded on December 19, 2013.

      REALISM is a prospective, multi-center, study of the safety and effectiveness of an
      endovascular approach to the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation using the Evalve
      Cardiovascular Valve Repair System (MitraClip® implant). Patients with moderate-to-severe
      (3+) or severe (4+) mitral regurgitation (MR), as determined by the site from a
      transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), were considered for enrollment in this study. The TTE
      and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) are used to assess eligibility criteria for MR
      severity, valve anatomy and left ventricular parameters.

        Patients screened in EVEREST II REALISM Study will first be screened for high risk (HR)
        status and enrolled into the HR arm if they meet eligibility for this arm of the study. If
        they do not meet eligibility for the HR arm, patients will be further screened for
        eligibility for enrollment into the non-high risk (NHR) arm of EVEREST II REALISM.

        Key Inclusion Criteria

          -  Moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) chronic mitral valve (MV) regurgitation and:

             1. Symptomatic with &gt; 25% LVEF and LVESD ≤55mm or, 2. Asymptomatic with one or more
             of the following: i. LVEF 25% to 60% ii. LVESD ≥40 mm iii. New onset of AFib iv. PASP
             &gt;50mmHg at rest or &gt;60mmHg with exercise.

          -  Candidate for MV surgery.

          -  The primary regurgitant jet originates from malcoaptation of the A2 and P2 scallops
             of the MV.

          -  Trans-septal catheterization is determined to be feasible by the treating physician.

        High Risk Inclusion Criteria (High Risk Arm)

          -  Predicted procedural mortality risk calculated using the STS surgical risk calculator
             of ≥ 12% or, in the judgment of a cardiac surgeon, the patient is considered a high
             risk surgical candidate due to the presence of one of the following indications:

               1. Porcelain aorta or mobile ascending aortic atheroma

               2. Post-radiation mediastinum

               3. Previous mediastinitis

               4. Functional MR with EF&lt;40

               5. Over 75 years old with EF&lt;40

               6. Re-operation with patent grafts

               7. Two or more prior chest surgeries

               8. Hepatic cirrhosis

               9. Three (3) or more of the following STS high risk factors 9.1 Creatinine &gt;2.5
                  mg/dL 9.2 Prior chest surgery 9.3 Age over 75 9.4 EF&lt;35
