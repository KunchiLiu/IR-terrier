      To detect functional correlation changes in the brain with anti-psychotic drug
      administration as compared to placebo, and b.) to measure if these changes correlate with
      the plasma level of anti-psychotic, and c.) to evaluate if these changes correlate with drug
      induced symptoms and changes in cognitive function.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status</measure>
    <time_frame>The change of RBANS scores between placebo and treatment conditions on two consequitive days</time_frame>

    <measure>Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effects Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 times (Before each MRI for 3 consecutive days)</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measures are the scores from side effect scales (Simpson-Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effects. It will measured in synchrony with Repeated Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status to explore if any of these measures would correlate with network changes in the brain.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feedback-based Probabilistic Classification Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Before every MRI except the 2nd and 4th which will occur during the MRI (5 times - 3 consecutive days)</time_frame>
    <description>On each trial, participants will view one of four images and will be asked to guess whether it belongs to Category A or B. For each participant, the four images will be randomly assigned to be stimuli S1, S2, S3 and S4. A different set of similar images (S5-S8; S9-S12, etc) will be used for repeated testing. On any given trial, stimuli S1 and S3 will belong to Category A with 90% probability and to Category B with 10% probability, while stimuli S2 and S4 will belong to Category B with 90% probability and to Category A with 10% probability. Stimuli S1 and S2 will be used in the reward-learning task and S3 and S4 in punishment-learning task. Two stimuli per valence will be employed in order to balance category outcome frequencies, so that one stimulus in each task will be associated with each outcome.</description>
