    <textblock>
      Remembering how to travel from one location to another is critical in everyday life, yet
      this vital ability declines with normal aging and can be further affected by conditions that
      disproportionately affect the elderly, such as vision loss or progressive dementia. Human
      and animal research has shown that two distinct memory systems interact during navigation.
      The first, referred to as allocentric navigation, is very flexible and uses spatial
      knowledge of key features or landmarks to develop and use a mental map of the environment.
      This approach involves brain regions that are critical for new learning and memory but that
      decline with age. The second, referred to as egocentric navigation, is inflexible and relies
      on &quot;habit&quot; memories that link specific features with specific directions. This approach
      relies on brain regions that are critical for &quot;automatic&quot; responses and that are relatively
      unaffected by age.

      The main problem is that allocentric navigation declines with age and is accompanied
      increased dependence on egocentric navigation. This change increases the risk of becoming
      disoriented or &quot;lost&quot; when traveling in unfamiliar areas or even when traveling new routes
      in familiar areas. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to examine whether
      non-invasive brain stimulation, specifically transcranial direct current stimulation, can
      improve allocentric navigation in healthy older adults and patients with mild cognitive
      impairment.

      Participants will complete two functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions while learning
      new environments. Before one of these sessions, participants will receive active brain
      stimulation over the parietal cortex. Before the other session, participants will receive
      sham brain stimulation over the parietal cortex. The effects of this stimulation will be
      evaluated using both an allocentric and an egocentric memory test. Physiologic effects will
      be evaluated using both task-based and resting-state MRI.
