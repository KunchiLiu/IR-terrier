      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of using a reduced-intensity
      condition regimen with UCBT, double cord UCBT, matched unrelated donor (MUD) bone marrow
      transplant (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) in patients with
      non-malignant disorders that are amenable to treatment with HSCT. After transplant, subjects
      will be followed for late effects and for ongoing graft success.

    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for many
      pediatric malignant and non-malignant disorders (NMD), the latter of which includes primary
      immunodeficiencies (PID), hemoglobinopathies, inherited metabolic disorders, and bone marrow
      failure syndromes. These NMD often have significant morbidity and risk for premature
      mortality, and HSCT can be curative by either replacement of defective hematopoietic cells
      with healthy donor cells or by the production of deficient enzyme by donor cells. HSCT in
      patients with NMD differs from that in malignant disorders for two important reasons- first,
      that these patients are typically naïve to chemotherapy and immunosuppression potentially
      leading to difficulties with engraftment, and second, that in the absence of malignancy,
      reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with subsequent bone marrow chimerism may be curative
      and result in decreased transplant-related mortality (TRM).

      In this research study, instead of using the standard myeloablative conditioning, the study
      doctor is using reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), in which lower doses of chemotherapy
      will be used. Although the lower doses may not eradicate every single stem cell in the bone
      marrow, nevertheless in the presented combination it still intends to eliminate already
      formed immune cells, paving the way to successful engraftment of donor cord blood cells.
      Engrafting cord blood cells can outcompete and reject the patients' few surviving stem
      cells. With reduced-intensity conditioning, the side effects on brain, heart, lung, liver,
      and other organ functions are usually less severe, and the patients can have a better
      long-term recovery. There is also realistic hope that after lower doses of chemotherapy many
      patients will avoid becoming sterile.

      The purpose of this study is to collect data from the patients undergoing reduced-intensity
      conditioning before HSCT, so that the study doctor can compare it to the standard
      myeloablative conditioning with the expectation that there will be full therapeutic benefits
      paired with better survival rate and improved quality of life following the reduced
      intensity approach compared to myeloablative regimen.

      The subjects will be stratified according to type of primary disease and degree of immune
      competence each of the three strata will use a different amount of alemtuzumab prior to
      transplant.

      Male and female subjects aged 2 months to 35 years (inclusive) who meet all of the
      eligibility criteria will be considered for this study. Non-malignant disease populations
      amenable to stem cell treatment, listed in the eligibility section, will be considered
      appropriate for this study. A full list of eligibility criteria appears later in this
      record.
