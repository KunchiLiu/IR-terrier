  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized, controlled feeding study is to investigate the potential
      health benefits of a pecan-containing diet. The investigators hypothesize the chronic
      consumption of pecans will improve an array of biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease
      and type 2 diabetes risk, including indices of oxidative stress, antioxidant activity,
      inflammation, endothelial function, and insulin resistance when compared with a control diet
      that is absent nuts.
