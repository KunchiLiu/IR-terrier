      Step 1: Identification and characterisation of the TREM1L protein from samples already
      available characterised at the hospital Central of Nancy Step 2: Study of the isoforms of
      TREM1L in correlation with the prognosis of sepsis, Step 3: implementation of assay methods
      for TREM1L (ELISA or SUPRA MS) Step 4: Validation of assays for TREM1L and its isoforms in a
      larger number of subjects (inclusion of samples from Dijon CHU and Besan√ßon CHU)
