      This clinical trial studies fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography
      (PET) in measuring treatment response in patients with newly diagnosed estrogen receptor
      (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative stage I-III breast
      cancer. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done before and during hormone therapy
      may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure the effect of a short course of endocrine therapy on primary breast cancer
      metabolism and proliferation by measuring changes in serial FLT PET measures pre and post a
      short course of endocrine therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare changes in imaging measures to tissue measures of response, in particular antigen
      identified by proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki-67), in the pre-therapy biopsy versus
      the post-therapy surgical specimen.

      II. Correlate imaging measures to measures of gene expression from pre and post therapy
      assays to determine if there are molecular changes associated with early response to
      therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo FLT PET at baseline and 1-6 weeks after the start of treatment.

    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change between pre-treatment and post-therapy measurements will be computed. Log transformations will be considered if the rates of change are highly skewed. Additionally, change in PET measures will be analyzed descriptively (such as by stem-and-leaf plot). Association between Ki-67 and Ki by FLT (KFLT) decline will be analyzed using the mid-P adjustment to Fisher's exact test to evaluate the potential clinical utility of change in FLT as a biomarker for early response, using Ki-67 as the standard for early response.</description>
