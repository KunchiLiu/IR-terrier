      The objectives of this study are, to test the effectiveness of Valproic Acid (VPA) in the
      prevention of chronic neuropathic and post-amputation pain, as well as to further define the
      underlying inflammatory and epigenetic mechanisms that lead to the development of such
      chronic pain.

      HYPOTHESES AND QUESTIONS

      Hypothesis 1: The use of oral valproic acid in combination with regional anesthesia in
      surgical limb-injury patients will decrease the incidence of chronic nerve injury and
      post-amputation pain.

      Goal 1: In a blinded, randomized placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial,
      investigators will determine if oral VPA added to regional anesthesia and standard
      perioperative management will reduce the incidence of nerve injury and post-amputation pain
      when compared with regional anesthesia alone.

      Hypothesis 2: The transition from acute to chronic pain is mediated via epigenetic
      mechanisms (differential DNA methylation) in genes involved in nociception.

      Goal 2: Investigators will analyze the DNA methylation patterns of patients with different
      types of neuropathic and post-amputation pain and determine if they are altered by VPA.

      RESEARCH DESIGN

      This study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to
      test the efficacy of valproic acid (VPA) in reducing the incidence of chronic neuropathic
      and post-amputation pain following amputation, stump revision, and surgery for limb injury
      with neurologic damage. Patients randomized to the &quot;Control arm&quot; of the trial, will receive
      standard regional anesthesia catheters (either peripheral nerve or epidural catheter),
      anesthetic management and a placebo. Patients randomized to the &quot;Intervention arm&quot; of the
      trial will receive standard regional anesthesia catheters (either peripheral nerve or
      epidural catheter), anesthetic management, and valproic acid 250mg preoperatively, and then
      three times per day for either 6 days post-operatively or until the time of discharge.

      METHODOLOGY

      The enrollment goal for the study (from all sites) will be 224 patients. Subjects will be
      recruited from the surgical clinics and the anesthesia pre-operative clinic. Outcomes for
      patients in the intervention arm will be compared with those managed with the current
      institutional standards of care including regional anesthesia catheter infusions. The study
      team anticipates a 10% drop-out rate at 3 months secondary to death and loss to follow up.
      Thus 202 evaluable patients (101 patients in each arm) at 3 months after surgery will be
      included in this study.

      After screening and enrollment, the study medication (VPA or placebo) will be administered.
      Research blood samples will be collected preoperatively, postoperatively (at the completion
      of study drug administration, and at the Amputation Clinic follow-up for expression
      analysis. All samples will be de-identified and subsequently studied in our laboratory and
      core facilities at Duke. Study specific questionnaires will be administered during the
      hospital stay, at 1 month (via mail), at 3 months (in clinic) and at 6 months (in clinic
      when possible).

      RANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT

      Randomization will be stratified by site and by surgical etiology. At the time of
      enrollment, subjects will be assigned to one of three surgical categories on the
      randomization assignment log: amputation, stump revision, or surgery for limb injury with
      neurologic damage. Prior to surgery, the Investigational Drug Pharmacist will dispense the
      study medication in liquid form and the container will be labeled &quot;study drug&quot; with no
      indication of the liquid contents. The pharmacist will be the only person aware of the
      treatment allocation. At the end of the trial, once endpoint adjudication has been completed
      for all study subjects, the study data and treatment allocation will be un-blinded. Initial
      drug administration will be performed prior to induction of anesthesia on the day of
      surgery. Subsequent doses will be administered at the bedside by the ICU or floor nurse
      depending on patient location. Participants will complete study drug administration unless
      they withdraw their consent or either their treating physician or the principal investigator
      believes it would be dangerous to continue valproic acid. If the subject withdraws during
      the administration of VPA, they will continue with their current medical regimen without
      alteration.

      DATA ANALYSIS PLAN

      The primary endpoint is the incidence of chronic pain at the 3-month evaluation point, and
      the chronic pain will be defined as an average pain score of 3 points or greater on the
      Self-Reported Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs pain scale (S-LANSS).
      Secondary endpoints will include the numeric scores from the S-LANSS, Brief Pain Inventory
      (BPI), Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) and RASS and the change in these
      scores from baseline to 3 months, as well as the incidence of neuropathic limb or
      post-amputation pain at 1 and 6 months after surgery. Frequency and percentage of the
      categorical variables in above endpoints will be reported by treatment arm and by assessed
      time. Mean, standard deviation and range of the mean scales of the above forms, as well as
      the changes of mean scales from baseline will be computed by arm and by assessed time.
      Two-sample chi-square tests will be used to assess the treatment difference of the primary
      endpoint and post-amputation pain (or neuropathic pain) at each time. Logistic regression
      will be applied to investigate the effect of treatment on the primary endpoint and
      post-amputation pain by adjusting for potential prognostic variables including baseline pain
      level, study site, type of surgery diabetes, and intervening therapies. Similar analyses
      will be carried out in study sub-groups of site, surgery type, and diabetic status.
      Two-sample t-tests will be used to assess treatment difference in changes of mean pain
      scales from baseline. In addition, linear regression will be used to assess the effect of
      treatment on changes in mean scales from baseline by adjusting for covariants. P values of
      less than 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance. Intent-to-treat
      analysis will be performed. Sensitivity analyses will also be carried out by excluding
      patients who drop out before 3 month post-surgery. If the dropout rate is larger than 10%
      and if there is evidence that the missing mechanism is not MCAR (Missing Completely At
      Random) but MAR (missing at random), multiple imputation will be conducted.

      Analysis of clinical study data will be carried out with a de-identified download from
      REDCap. All of these data shared with the Duke Center for Human Genetics (CHG) will be fully
      stripped of all 18 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)identifiers
      (ID). Private health information of study participants will be respected and all data
      analysis will be done in blinded fashion, such that individuals will not be identifiable
      from the final analysis dataset. Each patient will be allocated a study ID number when they
      sign a consent form, and thereafter will be referred to by that number. Investigators will
      have secure password protected access to REDCap in order to enter data. The dataset and
      biorepository will be fully de-identified once the dataset is complete and locked.

      Research blood samples are tracked and stored within our existing Laboratory Inventory
      Management System. All specimens are identified by barcode and are not identifiable except
      via a coding table held securely at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC), Durham Veterans
      Administration Medical Center (VAMC) and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center
      (WRNMMC) respectively.
