    <textblock>
      iENGAGE is a 4 session, in-clinic behavioral intervention that is delivered to new clinic
      patients during the first year of HIV care on a flexible delivery schedule, with
      intervention visits scheduled to coincide with HIV medical care visits. Interventionists
      from each participating collaborating site will be trained centrally to implement the
      iENGAGE protocol. Following study enrollment and baseline assessment, participants will be
      randomized to treatment as usual and intervention groups. For intervention-arm participants,
      each iENGAGE intervention session includes: interventionist-delivered educational content
      for managing HIV medical care appointment-keeping and information sessions for learning to
      manage HIV medications. The intervention will have a tailored, interactive agenda for each
      of the 4 sessions based on behavioral motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. The goal of
      this intervention is for the participant to establish early behaviors that help him/her to
      arrive at scheduled medical appointments and learn to take medications as prescribed during
      the initial year of HIV care in order to improve overall health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control's Retention In Care (CDC RIC) and the Participating and
      Communicating Together (PACT) antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence interventions have
      shown success in the literature, and they are well suited to target the two essential HIV
      adherence behaviors needed to achieve better overall health: HIV medical visit adherence and
      ART adherence. While these original interventions target each of these behaviors separately,
      the comprehensive iENGAGE intervention combines these two approaches to address the
      experience of an individual who is initiating HIV care. Upon entry to care, knowledge,
      motivation, and skills for adherence to HIV medical visits and ART must be learned rapidly.
      Jointly targeting these behaviors offers a distinct advantage over addressing them
      separately.

      iENGAGE integrates CDC RIC and PACT through their common intervention targets with the
      assistance of trained interventionists, who will maintain contact with the new patient to
      educate and assist with reinforcing the importance of adherence to care. While the actions
      required to attend HIV medical care appointments and take medications properly are distinct,
      each is influenced by an individual's personal motivation and skills for self-management of
      HIV infection and overall health; these principles are the focus of the intervention
      sessions for this protocol .

      During this intervention, our team will make every effort to protect all participants'
      confidential and private information in order to minimize possible study-associated risks.
      In addition, the follow up measurement plan for this study is unique, as it aims to utilize
      the X060831001: Unsolicited R24 for the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Sciences, CNICS,
      PI Michael Saag) secure electronic data infrastructure, which has existing defined protocols
      for the protection of human subjects data, including a data management core that is housed
      at the collaborating site at the University of Washington.

      Stigma Supplement (Michael J. Mugavero, Janet M. Turan, Bulent Turan)

      As part of this supplement, the research team has incorporated multi-item questionnaire
      measures of stigma into baseline and final data collection for the iENGAGE trial. The goal
      of Aim 1 is to examine the longitudinal associations and potential causal mechanisms in the
      relationships between dimensions of HIV-related stigma and HIV visit adherence,
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and viral load suppression, among control
      participants in the study. In addition, in Aim 2, we will examine the effects of the iENGAGE
      intervention on dimensions of stigma, by comparing changes in stigma in the two arms of the
      RCT.

      For Aim 3, after participants have completed the 48-week iENGAGE intervention, we will
      conduct up to 40 individual in-depth face-to-face qualitative interviews with selected
      participants using a separate informed consent process. Topics to be explored in these
      interviews include qualitative exploration of how HIV-related stigma and other
      intersectional stigmas affect engagement in HIV care, as wells as exploring how
      participation in the iENGAGE intervention may have influenced the participant's experiences
      of anticipated, internalized, and experienced stigma; as well as disclosure concerns and
      actual disclosure behavior.
