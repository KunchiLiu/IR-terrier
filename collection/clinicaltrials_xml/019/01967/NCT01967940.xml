  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 consists of 2 cohorts, starting with a sentinel cohort, in which 10 participants will
      be enrolled to receive open-label tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in addition to their current
      failing antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. This cohort will then be followed by a randomized,
      double-blind, cohort to compare the addition of TAF or placebo-to-match TAF in HIV-1
      positive adults who are failing their current ARV regimen. This randomized cohort will
      consist of approximately 90 participants.

      In Part 2, all participants who complete Part 1 of the study will discontinue their failing
      ARV regimen and TAF or placebo-to-match TAF for a 14-day washout period. Following the
      washout period, all participants who received TAF in Part 1 and have a &gt; 0.5 log10 decline
      in HIV-1 RNA will receive elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide
      single-tablet regimen (E/C/F/TAF STR) plus atazanavir (ATV) once daily for 48 weeks.
      Participants who received TAF who have a ≤ 0.5 log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA will be
      discontinued from the study and will not be eligible to continue into Part 2 of the study.
      All participants who received placebo in Part 1 will be eligible to participate in Part 2
      regardless of their viral load change.
