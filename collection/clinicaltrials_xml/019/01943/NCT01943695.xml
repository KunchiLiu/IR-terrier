    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The ultimate goal is for participants to complete approximately 130-180 minutes/week of non-linear aerobic training at 55% to 100% of the individually determined exercise capacity VO2peak), concurrent with chemotherapy. VO2peak will be determined by the CPET performed at baseline. The 130-180 minutes/week will be achieved via 3 individual aerobic training sessions at approximately 10 to 50 minutes/session (± 10 minutes). All sessions are required to be supervised.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Aerobic Training After Chemotherapy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The ultimate goal is for participants to complete approximately 130-180 minutes/week of non-linear aerobic training at 55% to 100% of the individually determined exercise capacity (VO2peak), after the completion of chemotherapy. VO2peak will be determined by the CPET performed at midpoint, or pre-surgery for neoadjuvant patients. For patients receiving adjuvant therapy, (except those who have additional surgery after chemotherapy), the aerobic training intervention must begin within 2 weeks of the patient's midpoint CPET. For patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and have additional surgery after chemotherapy, the aerobic training intervention will begin within approximately 6 weeks of surgery, per the discretion of the treating physician. The 130-180 minutes/week will be achieved via 3 individual aerobic training sessions at approximately 10 to 50 minutes/session (± 10 minutes). All sessions are required to be supervised.</description>

    <description>The ultimate goal is for participants to complete approximately 130-180 minutes/week of non-linear aerobic training at 55% to 100% of the individually determined exercise capacity (VO2peak), during and after chemotherapy. For patients receiving adjuvant therapy (except those who have additional surgery after chemotherapy), VO2peak will be determined by the CPETs performed at baseline and midpoint. For patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and have additional surgery after chemotherapy, VO2peak will be determined by the CPETs or at baseline, pre- surgery, and post-surgery. The 130-180 minutes/week will be achieved via 3 individual aerobic training sessions at approximately 10 to 50 minutes/session (± 10 minutes).

    <description>Participants in this group will be asked not to change their level of exercise. Following the completion of the follow-up study assessments, participants will be offered a 6-week supervised aerobic training program. Participants opting to participate will be expected to initiate training sessions within 30 days of the follow-up study assessments. The aerobic training program will be identical to the first 6 weeks of the Arms A and B and will follow the identical procedures.</description>
