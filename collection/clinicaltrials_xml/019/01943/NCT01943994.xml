  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most promising lines of investigation for the therapeutic use of hallucinogens in
      the 1960s and 1970s was in the treatment of drug dependence. We propose to examine
      psilocybin administration combined with a structured smoking cessation treatment program in
      nicotine dependent individuals in order to provide preliminary data on the efficacy of this
      combined treatment for smoking cessation. Prior work in our laboratory has shown that under
      carefully prepared and supportive conditions, psilocybin administration can facilitate
      highly salient experiences with enduring personal meaning and spiritual significance
      (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008). It is plausible that embedding such highly meaningful
      experiences into a drug dependence cessation attempt may provide an enduring motivation for
      remaining abstinent. Cigarette smoking is a good model system for studying drug dependence
      because users are less likely to be challenged by the many social and economic impairments
      that often accompany dependence on other drugs such as cocaine, heroin, or alcohol. More
      specifically, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled comparative efficacy study in
      which either psilocybin or transdermal nicotine patch are administered under highly
      supportive conditions to individuals who are nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers, who have
      had multiple unsuccessful quit attempts, and who continue to desire to quit smoking. Other
      than nicotine dependence, participants will be healthy. Fifteen participants have already
      completed a preliminary open-label pilot-study with no control condition. Fifty additional
      participants will be enrolled and randomized to either psilocybin (n=25), or nicotine patch
      (n=25) treatment. Participants will receive a 13-week course of cognitive behavioral therapy
      for smoking cessation, with Target Quit Date set for week 5. After several preparation
      meetings with study monitors, participants will have either a single day-long psilocybin
      session using a high dose (30 mg/70 kg), or a standard 8 to 10-week course of nicotine patch
      treatment. Participant smoking status will be assessed repeatedly for 8 weeks after the
      Target Quit Date, including biological verification of smoking status through breath and
      urine samples. Smoking status will also be assessed at three follow up sessions
      approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after the Target Quit Date. Additionally, participants
      will undergo MRI scanning before and after Target Quit Date to assess the brain-based
      mechanisms associated with these treatments. Individuals assigned to the nicotine patch
      study treatment condition will be eligible to undergo an optional high dose psilocybin
      session after completing the 6-month follow-up meeting.
