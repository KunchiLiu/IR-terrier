    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the ocular and systemic adverse events of
      ranibizumab (Lucentis)for DME (diabetic macular edema) following previous treatment with
      intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin).

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of intravitreally administered 0.3mg ranibizumab
      (Lucentis) in subjects with DME (diabetic macular edema) previously treated with
      intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin) with a randomized comparative dosing strategy, monthly vs
      &quot;treat-and-extend.&quot; Thirty patients total will be enrolled in the study, 15 in each group.
      This study will have a 1-year treatment period. The recruitment period will occur over 1
      year with total potential study duration of 2 years.

    <description>Enrolled subjects will initially receive 3 loading doses of open-label Ranibizumab 0.3 mg given via intravitreal injection every 28 days (+/- 7 days from the last treatment). After the third loading dose, the follow-up interval is determined by the Principal Investigator based on OCT results as stated in the protocol. The follow-up interval is increased by 2 weeks (+/- 7 days) at each visit up to a maximum interval of 12 weeks (+/- 7 days). There is criteria built into the protocol in case a reduction in the follow-up intervals becomes necessary based upon worsening OCT results.</description>
