    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a multi-faceted communication
      intervention for family members of critically ill patients to reduce the family members'
      long-term symptoms of depression and anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in four elderly Americans die in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care unit.
      An expanding body of literature documents that physician-family communication and
      end-of-life care is poor in intensive care units. These deficiencies are associated with
      high rates of adverse psychological outcomes among surrogates, physician-family conflict,
      and life support decisions that may be inconsistent with patients' goals and preferences.
      There is a lack of information on practical, generalizable interventions that effectively
      improve this important aspect of care for elderly patients and their families.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted
      communication intervention as compared to an educational control to improve psychological
      outcomes among family members of critically ill patients, using a randomized, controlled
      trial design.

      The trial's original sample size of 400 was chosen to maximize the ability to detect
      differences based on a secondary outcome measure (costs) that required a substantially
      larger sample size than the primary outcome. The trial was initially overpowered for the
      primary outcome. Even with the sample size of 400, the study had limited power to detect
      small but clinically important differences in the secondary outcome of costs. Since the
      original power calculations were conducted, new data were published which indicated that
      cost analysis in this context will require an even larger sample size based one effect
      modification from whether the patient lived or died. Enrollment was initially slow due to
      regional changes in admission patterns. Subsequently, the study team has added study ICUs
      and we have re-allocated resources to maximize screening and enrolling, which has come at a
      risk of compromising the quality of the data and other aspects of the study that are getting
      comparably less attention. With a sample size of 300, the study is well powered to detect
      small and clinically important differences in the primary outcome measure Hospital Anxiety
      and Depression Score (HADS). The Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended decreasing the
      sample size based on the considerations outlined above.
