    <textblock>
      The optimal intensity of oral anticoagulation in China patients undergoing mechanical valve
      replacements is still controversial due to the different risk profiles of thrombophilia and
      bleeding in Chinese patients. Elevated D-dimer could reflect a pro-thrombogenic or
      prothrombotic state, and thus might be used to decide the intensity of oral anticoagulation.

      This study was to evaluate whether elevated D-dimer levels could help to determine the
      intensity of oral anticoagulation in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses.

      Background: The optimal intensity of oral anticoagulation in China patients undergoing
      mechanical valve replacements is still controversial due to the different risk profiles of
      thrombophilia and bleeding in Chinese patients. Elevated D-dimer could reflect a
      pro-thrombogenic or prothrombotic state, and thus might be used to decide the intensity of
      oral anticoagulation.

      Objective: This study was to evaluate whether elevated D-dimer levels could help to
      determine the intensity of oral anticoagulation in patients with mechanical heart valve
      prostheses.

      Methods: A single-center, prospective study was performed. 629 Patients with mechanical
      valve replacement who had received oral anticoagulation. The patients were randomly assigned
      to three groups The intensity of anticoagulation for group one was standard intensity
      (INR:2.5-3.5). The intensity of anticoagulation for group two was kept at low intensity
      without adjustment (INR:1.6-2.6), and for group three , The intensity of anticoagulation
      maintained at low level initiatively (INR:1.6-2.6), D-dimer testing were analyzed two times
      at 3 month later. In case of D-dimer level elevated, adjusted the intensity of
      anticoagulation to standard level. The endpoint of the study was the subsequent
      thromboembolic and major bleeding during an average follow-up of 2 years.
