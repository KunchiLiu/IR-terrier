  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many factors influence the development of persistent pain after CS (chronic pain) as well as
      post-partum depression. We are attempting to use trajectory pain methods in an attempt to
      identify those at risk for the development of persistent pain post delivery using a daily
      method of contact for the determination of pain scores. Assessments are also done evaluating
      satisfaction of pain management and maternal/infant bonding opportunities. Physical activity
      is monitored by subject's wearing a Fitbit with correlation being done with pain scores
      obtained over 60 days postop with eligible subjects..

      Subjects are contacted on a daily basis after having a cesarean delivery to determine
      current pain, current pain unpleasantness, worst pain, worst pain unpleasantness, average
      pain, and average pain unpleaseantness. Preoperatively subjects complete a
      psycho-social/depressive screening questionnaire. Pain treatments/satisfaction assessments
      are captured for the first 24 hours. Mother/baby outcomes are also captured. Physical
      activity and pain scores are also correlated with the subject's wearing of a Fitbit physical
      activity bracelet with eligible subjects for 60 days post-delivery.
