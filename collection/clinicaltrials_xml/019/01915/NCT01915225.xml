      Background:

      - Recent advances in cancer research have led to new therapies to treat the disease. It is
      important to continue these advances and discover new ones. To do that, researchers need
      tissue samples from solid tumors. This study will collect such samples from people already
      scheduled to have a procedure at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIHCC).

      Objectives:

      - To collect tissue samples for use in studying new ways to treat tumors.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 18 years and older, with a precancerous or cancerous solid tumor who are scheduled
      to have surgery or a biopsy at the NIHCC.

      Design:

        -  Before their procedure, participants will have a small blood sample taken.

        -  Some participants will undergo leukapheresis. In this procedure, blood is removed
           through a tube in one arm and circulated through a machine that removes white blood
           cells. The blood, minus the white blood cells, is returned through a tube in the other
           arm. The procedure takes 3 4 hours.

        -  For all participants, during the surgery or biopsy, pieces of the tumor and pieces of
           normal tissue near it will be removed for this study. The rest of the tumor or
           precancerous growth will be sent to a lab for analysis.

        -  Participants will return to the clinic about 6 weeks after the operation for a routine
           checkup. Some may have to return for additional follow-up.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Recent advances and insights into the molecular pathogenesis of cancer have led to the
           development of novel molecular and biologic targeted therapies for the treatment of
           advanced cancer patients. A critical challenge in extending these studies involves the
           identification and validation of new therapeutic targets for future cancer therapies.

        -  As Surgical Oncologists at the NCI, we have an interest in identifying novel molecular
           and biologic targets to facilitate the development of future cancer therapies. In
           addition, we have the primary responsibility for providing surgical consultative
           services to the NIH. As such, we are uniquely positioned to acquire and perform
           important studies on solid tumor tissue to help identify therapeutic targets that may
           have significant clinical ramifications.

      OBJECTIVES:

      - Primary Objective: To collect biologic samples from patients undergoing diagnostic,
      preventative, or therapeutic interventions for premalignant, primary or metastatic solid
      tumors for the purpose of identifying novel molecular and biologic therapeutic targets

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with radiographic evidence or
           clinical suspicion of, genetic predisposition for, biochemical evidence of, or
           histologically/cytologically proven solid neoplasms who require diagnostic,
           preventative, or therapeutic intervention as a part of the diagnosis and /or treatment
           and/or follow up for their neoplasm

        -  Patients without solid tumors in whom a diagnostic, preventative, or therapeutic
           intervention is being performed, but for whom surgical quality and safety outcomes data
           are generated.

        -  Patients should have laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable
           limits by standard of practice guidelines prior to planned intervention

      DESIGN:

        -  A tissue acquisition trial in which tissues will be obtained at the time of
           intervention

        -  Tissue and blood will be processed at the time of collection, transferred to the
           Clinical Pharmacology program (CPP) for further processing.

        -  No investigational therapy will be given.

        -  It is anticipated that 1000 patients will be enrolled over a period of 10 years
