  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a novel standard of care protocol, washing
      red cell and platelet transfusions for younger patients with acute leukemia, has yielded
      improved clinical outcomes at Strong Memorial Hospital (Rochester, New York, USA). This
      standard of care was implemented based upon an earlier randomized trial (BMC Blood
      Disorders. 2004 Dec 10;4(1):6) The comparator will be historical controls from the medical
      literature.

        The study population is comprised of 98 men and women who were both diagnosed and treated
        for Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Acute Lymphoid Leukemia at Strong Memorial Hospital, a
        tertiary medical center located in Rochester, NY, USA. All of these patients received
        washed red cell and platelet transfusions as part of the hospital's standard protocol for
        patients with acute leukemia.
