    <textblock>
      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study using avatrombopag to treat adults with thrombocytopenia associated with liver
      disease. The study will evaluate avatrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia
      associated with liver disease prior to an elective procedure to reduce the need for platelet
      transfusions or any rescue procedure for bleeding due to procedural and post-procedural
      bleeding complications. Participants will be enrolled into 2 cohorts according to mean
      baseline platelet count and, within each baseline platelet count cohort will be further
      stratified by risk of bleeding associated with the elective procedure (low, moderate, or
      high) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) status (Yes or No).

      This study will consist of 3 phases: Prerandomization, Randomization, and a Follow-up Phase.
      The Prerandomization Phase includes one Screening Visit that will take place from Day -14
      through Day -1; the Randomization Phase includes the Baseline Period, Treatment Period, and
      Procedure Day Period (5 to 8 days after last dose of study drug [Study Day 10 to 13]). The
      Follow-up Phase comprises 2 visits: 7 days post Procedure Day and 30 days after receiving
      the last dose of study drug. Permitted procedures include: Paracentesis; Thoracentesis;
      Gastrointestinal endoscopy with or without plans for biopsy, colonoscopy, polypectomy, or
      variceal banding; Liver biopsy; Bronchoscopy with or without plans for biopsy; Ethanol
      ablation therapy or chemoembolization for HCC; Vascular catheterization (including right
      side procedures in participants with pulmonary hypertension); Transjugular intrahepatic
      portosystemic shunt; Dental procedures; Renal biopsy; Biliary interventions; Nephrostomy
      tube placement; Radiofrequency ablation; and Laparoscopic interventions.

             placement, angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass grafting)

         19. Females of childbearing potential who have had unprotected sexual intercourse within
             30 days before study entry and who do not agree to use a highly effective method of

             implant/injection, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia)
             throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.
             If currently abstinent, the participant must agree to use a double-barrier method as
             described above if she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days

             childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive
             amenorrhea in the appropriate age group and without other known or suspected cause)

             hematocrit ≥ 54% for men and ≥ 45% for women

         25. Current malignancy including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (except HCC)

         26. Any history of concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator(s), would compromise the participant's ability to safely complete the
             study
