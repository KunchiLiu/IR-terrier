      The two objectives of the study are to assess the current standard of care treatment outcome
      in none/mild, moderate and severe calcified coronary lesions and to obtain financial data
      and procedure data to support reimbursement initiatives and health care economics analysis.

      This prospective, non-randomized, multi-center study includes subjects who meet all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and sign the ICF. This study may treat up to
      approximately 500 subjects at up to 50 active sites in the U.S. Subjects will be followed up
      to three (3) years. Subjects will be stratified into one (1) of three (3) arms based on the
      degree of calcification in the coronary lesion as defined by this protocol. An interim
      analysis of standard of care treatment used will be performed after an arm has 40 subjects
      whom have completed the discharge visit. The duration of the study is expected to be
      approximately four (4) years.

    <description>To assess the safety of the current standard of care treatment when used to facilitate stent deployment in de novo coronary lesions.

    <description>Heath care resource utilization, including hospital billing data (e.g., UB-04 forms, itemized bills) from the index hospitalization and any subsequent coronary revascularization procedures will be collected by the Health Economics Core Laboratory.

    <description>To assess the current standard of care treatment capability of successfully facilitating stent deployment in de novo coronary lesions. Procedural success is defined as success in facilitating stent delivery with a residual stenosis of &lt;50% and without the occurrence of an in-hospital MACE, coronary lesion as determined by the Angiographic Core Laboratory. Lesion success is defined as success in facilitating stent delivery with a post-procedural result of &lt;50% residual stenosis for a given lesion treated during index procedure without severe angiographic complications determined by the Angiographic Core Laboratory.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Subjects must be scheduled for percutaneous coronary revascularization involving
             stent deployment in de novo coronary lesions. Percutaneous coronary revascularization
             is defined as treatment with commercially available devices that may include but not
             limited to balloon angioplasty, cutting balloon, rotablation, etc. followed by the
             stent placement.

          3. Subjects CK-MB must be less than or equal to the upper limit of lab normal value
             within eight (8) hours prior to procedure. If CK-MB results are not yet available
             prior to initiating procedure, subjects Troponin I or Troponin T must be less than or
             equal to the upper limit of lab normal value within eight (8) hours prior to the
             procedure.
