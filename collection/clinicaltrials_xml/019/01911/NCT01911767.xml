      The primary objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women
      with multiple sclerosis who were exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen Multiple Sclerosis
      product during the eligibility window for that product. The Registry-specified Biogen MS
      products being studied are dimethyl fumarate, Pegylated human interferon beta-1a, and
      Dalclizumab High Yield Process (DAC HYP).

    <textblock>
      The Biogen Multiple Sclerosis Pregnancy Exposure Registry is a prospective, observational
      registry designed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who
      were exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen Multiple Sclerosis product during the
      eligibility window for that product. Women of childbearing potential are a considerable
      segment of the patient population affected by MS and are likely to be exposed to a
      Registry-specified Biogen MS product around the time of conception and during pregnancy.
      Biogen completed pregnancy registries for Avonex and Tysabri; however, formal studies in
      pregnant women have not been conducted. Therefore, it is important to evaluate, in a global
      Pregnancy Registry, how exposure to a marketed Biogen MS product specified in this Pregnancy
      Registry may affect pregnancy and infant outcomes. Data will be collected on prospective
      pregnancies (i.e. enrollment prior to knowledge of outcome) at time of enrollment, 6 to 7
      months gestation, and approximately 4,12, and 52 weeks after estimated date of delivery. The
      prevalence of spontaneous abortions, birth defects, and other pregnancy and infant outcomes
      will be calculated and compared to background rates from external sources such as the
      European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies.

      <textblock>
        Within each product cohort, approximately 310 to 375 pregnant women exposed to a
        Registry-specified Biogen MS product will be enrolled in order to observe 300 prospective
        pregnancy outcomes. The infants born to these women will also be part of the population
        studied. Patients with prenatal testing prior to enrollment (with the exception of a first
        trimester ultrasound to date the pregnancy) will not be counted towards the 300
        prospective pregnancy outcomes.
