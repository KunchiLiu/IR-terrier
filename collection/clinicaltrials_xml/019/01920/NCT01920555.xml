  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the efficacy, durability, safety, and tolerability of multiple
      single doses of Ketamine vs. active placebo for treating patients with treatment resistant
      depression who are taking an antidepressant that is not working for them.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate whether all doses (0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg,
      and 1.0 mg/kg) of ketamine are superior to active placebo (midazolam 0.045 mg/kg) therapy in
      the acute treatment of patients with treatment resistant depression within 72 hours (Day 3),
      when added to ongoing and stable antidepressant therapy.
