      This study is designed to evaluate the performance of VCE in the assessment of mucosal
      inflammation 6 months after the first VCE procedure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center (up to 15 sites) study which aims to assess the ability
      of VCE (Video capsule endoscopy) to detect change in the severity of the small bowel mucosal
      disease activity in CD subjects after 6 months .

      Up to 75 subjects will participate in this study. An interim analysis will be done after
      study completion with 20 subjects. All subjects to be enrolled in this study will be
      pediatric and\or adult subjects with known Crohn's disease

          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of known Crohn disease

          3. Referred to ileocolonoscopy (up to 4 weeks before the CE procedure)

          4. Proven patency by the Agile capsule or another approach deemed clinically acceptable
             by the investigator, e.g. CT enterography, MRE, performed within the 90 days prior to
             enrollment.

          5. Subject or parent agrees to sign consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment:

          1. Subjects with change in IBD drug therapy between the baseline ileocolonoscopy and VCE

          2. Subjects with a history of prior ileocecectomy, Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis (IPAA)
             and J pouch or an ostomy

          3. Stricture seen on radiological exam.

          6. Antibiotic Associated Colitis

          7. Known history of intestinal obstruction or current obstructive symptoms, such as
             severe abdominal pain with accompanying nausea or vomiting, based on investigator
             judgment.

          8. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including aspirin (twice weekly or more), not
