  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an 6 month multi-centre, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind
      clinical trial followed by conversion of each arm to active nintedanib for an additional 6
      months comparing the effect of nintedanib 150mg BID on the progression of IPF measured by
      using HRCT, lung function, 6MWT, biomarkers, and PROs with continued treatment and
      assessments for up to 18 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Written Informed Consent consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation
             Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and local laws signed prior to entry into the study

          2. Patient aged &gt;= 40 years at Visit 1.

          3. IPF diagnosed, according to the 2011 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT IPF guidelines for diagnosis
             and management, within 5 years and reaffirmed applying 2011 Guidelines (P11-07084) if
             diagnosed &gt;2 years and up to 5 year from Visit 1,. Diagnosis must be confirmed by
             chest HRCT taken within 24 months of Visit 1. All HRCT results reported to be
             possible or inconsistent usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) must have confirmatory
             pathology.

          4. DLCO (corrected for Hb): 30%-79% predicted of normal

          5. FVC &gt;= 50% predicted of normal at Visit 1 and Visit 2

                  for maintenance of an indwelling intravenous device (e.g. enoxaparin 4000 IU
                  s.c. per day) and prophylactic use of antiplatelet therapy (e.g. acetyl
                  salicylic acid up to 325 mg/d, or clopidogrel at 75 mg/d, or equivalent doses of
                  other antiplatelet therapy)

          4. Planned major surgery within the next 3 months, including lung transplantation, major
             abdominal or major intestinal surgery.

          5. Thrombotic risk

               1. Known inherited predisposition to thrombosis.

               2. History of thrombotic event (including stroke and transient ischemic attacks)
                  within 12 months

          6. Current or planned usage of any investigational drug during the course of this trial

          7. Previous treatment with nintedanib within a clinical trial in the previous 3 months
             and discontinuation of nintedanib study treatment due to an adverse event

          8. Known hypersensitivity to the trial drug or its component

          9. A disease or condition which in the opinion of investigator may put the patient at
             risk because of participation in this trial or limit the patient's ability to
             participate in this trial. Patients will be excluded if they require greater than
             12L/min oxygen, are not ambulatory or require use of a walker or cane during the 6
             Minute Titration Walk Test. Patients who cannot complete the 6 Minute Titration Walk
             Test are excluded from participation.

         10. Alcohol or drug abuse which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with
             trial participation.

         11. Pregnant women or women who are breast feeding or of child bearing potential not
             using two effective methods of birth control (one barrier and one highly effective
             non-barrier) for at least 1 month prior to trial and/or not committing to using it
             until 3 months after end of treatment.
