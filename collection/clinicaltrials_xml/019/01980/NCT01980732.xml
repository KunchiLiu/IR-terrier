      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate 68Ga-DOTA TATE PET/CT for staging and
      monitoring response to chemotherapy in patients with carcinoid, neuroendocrine tumors,
      medullary thyroid cancer and other cancers expressing somatostatin receptors.

          -  Less than 18 years-old at the time of radiotracer administration

          -  Pregnant or nursing

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL

          -  Hepatic enzyme levels more than 5 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Use of any other investigational product or device within 30 days prior to dosing, or
