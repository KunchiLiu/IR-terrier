      1. To determine if BCG immunisation at birth, compared to no BCG immunisation, leads to a
           reduction in measures of allergy and infection in the first 12 months of life.

        2. To evaluate the immunological mechanisms underlying the non-specific effects of BCG by
           comparing markers of immunity between the BCG and non-BCG groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a dramatic rise in allergic diseases worldwide since the 1980s. Asthma rates
      increased first, followed by eczema, allergic rhinitis and, more recently, food allergy -
      especially in infants and young children. In Australia, the prevalence of allergic disease
      is particularly high: up to 30% of children are affected, and eczema and asthma are among
      the most common chronic diseases of childhood.

      Preventing allergic disease by an immunomodulatory intervention early in life would be a
      major advance with significant implications for individual health and public health
      resources. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunisation is a potential intervention with an
      established safety profile. This vaccine has powerful non-specific effects on the cellular
      immune response that potentially prime host immunity away from an allergic pathway.
      Observational data and one small randomised controlled trial (RCT) suggest that BCG
      immunisation at birth leads to a substantial reduction in allergic disease - however, there
      is an absence of level 1 evidence.
