      The long term goal is to improve the quality and equity of chronic pain treatment among VA
      patients. The primary objective of this study is to improve pain outcomes among black VA
      patients with chronic, musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, who experience poorer pain treatment and
      outcomes than their white counterparts. The work proposed is expected to result in a
      non-pharmacological intervention, delivered by telephone, designed to reduce pain and
      improve functioning among black patients with MSK pain, by promoting walking. This
      intervention is specifically designed to address factors that contribute to MSK pain among
      black Veterans; however, the investigators expect that it will also benefit non-black
      Veterans. The proposed research is innovative, in its use of proactive outreach and recent
      advances in self-regulation strategies (such as Action Planning) to help black Veterans
      overcome psychological, environmental, utilization-related, and provider-related barriers
      that contribute to pain.

      1. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE. Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is one of the most common
           conditions among Veterans, affecting approximately 60% of those seen in VA primary
           care. Although perceived effectiveness of chronic pain treatment is low among all VA
           patients, black patients are less likely than whites to perceive their treatment as
           effective, and are more likely to experience functional limitations due to pain. There
           is growing consensus that chronic MSK pain is best addressed by a biopsychosocial
           approach that acknowledges the role of psychological and environmental factors, some of
           which differ by race. For example, blacks experience greater pain-related fear and
           lower self-efficacy in coping with pain (psychological contributors), and neighborhoods
           that make physical activity difficult (environmental contributors). However, there is a
           lack of effective interventions to improve pain treatment among minority patients,
           particularly those that target psychological and environmental contributors.

        2. OBJECTIVES. The long term goal is to improve the quality and equity of pain treatment
           in order to improve pain outcomes for all Veterans. The objective of this application
           is to test the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention that specifically
           targets known barriers to effective pain care among blacks Veterans with chronic MSK
           pain. The primary hypothesis is that a telephone-delivered intervention, which
           emphasizes walking and incorporates Action Planning, Motivational Interviewing (MI) and
           Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques, and the use of pedometers, will improve
           core chronic pain outcomes in black Veterans.

        3. METHODS. The investigators propose a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of the
           intervention compared with usual care (UC) among 250 black and 250 non-black patients
           with chronic MSK pain. Patients from the Atlanta VAMC will be identified using data
           from the recently funded VA cohort study of Veterans with diagnoses of musculoskeletal
           pain in VA care. Patients will be screened by phone, and, if eligible, will be
           administered the full baseline survey. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to
           the Usual Care (UC) or intervention condition (IC). Intervention participants will
           receive a pedometer-mediated walking intervention that will incorporate Action Planning
           and the use MI and CBT techniques. The intervention will be delivered in 6 telephone
           counseling sessions over three months. Patients in the UC condition will receive an
           informational brochure and a pedometer. The study is powered to find a difference
           between the IC and UC groups within the black and non-black groups. The primary outcome
           is chronic pain-related physical functioning, assessed by the revised Roland and Morris
           Disability Questionnaire, a measure recommended by the Initiative on Methods,
           Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT). The investigators will
           also examine whether the intervention improves other IMMPACT-recommended domains (pain
           intensity, emotional functioning, and ratings of overall improvement), will examine
           whether psychological factors targeted by the intervention mediate improvement in pain
           outcomes, and will test the effectiveness of the intervention on non-black patients and
           other subgroups of patients who may experience barriers to effective pain management.
           Measures will be assessed by mail or phone survey at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.
           Data analysis of primary aims will follow intent-to-treat methodology.

        4. STATUS. In Phase 1, the investigators conducted four focus groups in preparation for
           the intervention. Intervention and Control recruitment for Phase 2 began early July
           2016.

        5. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. This project will result in a non-pharmacological intervention
           to improve pain-related functioning among black Veterans with chronic MSK pain in VA
           care, which may also benefit other Veterans who have similar contributors to pain.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients must receive care at the Atlanta VAMC and

          -  have back, hip or knee pain for a duration of at least 6 months,

          -  moderate-severe pain intensity and interference with function (defined as a PEG score
             of 5 or greater),

          -  self-reported ability to walk at least 1 block, and

          -  must be able to communicate effectively by telephone (no cognitive disability). The
             investigators will not exclude patients who are on medication or receiving
             interventions to treat their chronic pain.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators will not include the approximately 10% of patients who have no race
             data; administrative race data will be verified on the brief screening survey. The
             investigators will also not include any vulnerable populations or those who meet any
             of the following exclusion criteria that may interfere with the outcome assessment:

               -  moderately severe cognitive impairment defined as &gt; 1 error on a brief cognitive
                  screener;

               -  anticipated back, knee, hip, or other major surgery within the next 6 months,
                  and

               -  a diagnosis (on the MSD) of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other psychosis.

               -  The investigators will also exclude any Veterans who also happen to be VA
                  employees at the Atlanta VAMC because employees cannot be compensated for
                  participating in research studies.
