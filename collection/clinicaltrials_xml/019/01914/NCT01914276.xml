      Objectives: (1) To determine the incidence of lower-extremity lymphedema after staging
      surgery for endometrial cancer; (2) to describe lymphedema-related morbidity after staging
      surgery for endometrial cancer and (3) to evaluate pre- and post-operative quality of life
      in women with endometrial cancer who undergo staging surgery.

      Data analysis and risk/safety issues: The proposed study will consist of a convenience
      sample of women who undergo minimally invasive surgery for endometrial cancer over a 1 year
      period. The investigators anticipate enrollment of 75 to 100 women. Frequency tables and
      difference with its 95% exact confidence intervals between pre-and post-operative lower
      extremity lymphedema measurements and quality of life questionnaires will be estimated.

    <description>The study team plans to measure QoL via 2 questionnaires, specifically the EQ-5D and FACT-G. FACT-G and EQ-5D-derived utility scores will be calculated and summarized pre- and post-operatively for all patients using descriptive statistics (means, medians, ranges). The difference with 95% exact confidence intervals between pre- and post-operative FACT-G scores and EQ-5D utility scores obtained at each post-operative visit (t1, t2, &amp; t3) will be estimated.</description>
