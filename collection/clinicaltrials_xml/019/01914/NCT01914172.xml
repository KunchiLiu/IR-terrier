  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kallmann syndrome (KS), also known as congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH), is a
      rare endocrine disorder that is characterized by failure to undergo puberty combined with
      infertility. KS/CHH patients face a number of psychosocial burdens related to delays in
      diagnosis, inadequate access to expert care, and lack of information about the condition. As
      such, there is some evidence to suggest that KS/CHH patients have unmet health needs. This
      study aims to identify the needs of patients and understand the issues that must be overcome
      to achieve improved health and quality of life.

      This study aims to examine the experiences of patients diagnosed with Kallmann syndrome
      (KS)/congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH).

      The study includes two parts:

        -  online survey (less than 30 minutes to complete)

        -  focus groups with KS/CHH patients

      The aim of this project is to better understand what health needs are not presently being
      met for these patients and to identify targets for improving the care of patients diagnosed
      with KS/CHH
