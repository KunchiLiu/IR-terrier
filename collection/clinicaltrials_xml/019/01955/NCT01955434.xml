    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases
      (SMAC) mimetic LCL161 alone or with cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with
      multiple myeloma that has returned or does not respond to treatment. Biological therapies,
      such as SMAC mimetic LCL161, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving SMAC mimetic LCL161 alone or
      with cyclophosphamide is more effective in treating multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the confirmed overall response rate (&gt;= partial response [PR]) to LCL161
      (SMAC mimetic LCL161), used as a single agent, in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma
      (MM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the confirmed overall response rate to LCL161 in combination with
      cyclophosphamide, when cyclophosphamide is added to LCL161 for lack of response or
      progression.

      II. To estimate the overall survival and event-free survival of patients treated with LCL161
      in combination with cyclophosphamide, when cyclophosphamide is added to LCL161 for lack of
      response or progression.

      III. To evaluate the tolerability of LCL161 alone and in combination with cyclophosphamide
      in patients with relapsed MM.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine degradation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP1) in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), changes in serum cytokines, and changes in immune
      cell subsets by flow cytometry.

      II. To correlate the effect of LCL161 with the presence of activating mutations of the
      nuclear factor kappa beta (NFKB) pathway.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LCL161 alone, and LCL161 in combination with
      cyclophosphamide.

      IV. To describe patient-reported health-related quality of life and symptoms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive SMAC mimetic LCL161 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Patients lacking a minor response by end of course 2 or partial response by end of course 4
      may also receive cyclophosphamide PO QD on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 at the discretion of the
      treating physician. Patients taking cyclophosphamide with less than a 25% interval reduction
      in paraprotein receive SMAC mimetic LCL161 on days 2, 9, 16, and 23. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for 1 year.
