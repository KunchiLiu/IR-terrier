    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the effects of MV targeted ASV in addition to optimized
      medical therapy versus optimized medical therapy alone at 6 months in patients with acute
      decompensated HF. The study will also assess changes in functional parameters, biomarkers,
      quality of life (QOL), and sleep.

    <description>Patients in the new treatment and control groups are formed into matched pairs based on their risk profiles. For each matched pair, the new treatment patient is labeled a 'winner' or a 'loser' depending on who had a CV death first. If that is not known, they are labeled a 'winner' or 'loser' depending on who had a HF hospitalization first. Otherwise they are considered tied. The win ratio is the total number of winners divided by the total numbers of losers.</description>
