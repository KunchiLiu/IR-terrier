      Primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of afatinib in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR (Epidermal
      growth factor receptor) mutation(s) and have never been treated with an EGFR-TKI (tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor). Secondary objective is to assess the time to symptomatic progression (as
      judged by investigator).
