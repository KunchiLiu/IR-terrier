      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of treatment with
      once daily administration of AQX-1125 compared to placebo in subjects following
      exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) by targeting the SHIP1 (Src
      Homology 2-containing Inositol-5'-Phosphatase 1) pathway.

             sputum production

          3. Chronic productive cough for at least 3 months in each of the 2 years prior to
             screening (if other causes of productive cough have been excluded) and/or an
             exacerbation of COPD with predominantly bronchitic symptoms at enrolment

          4. At least 2 documented exacerbations during the last 18 months prior to screening.

          5. Presentation of a diagnosed acute exacerbation of COPD, or have recently (within 3
             days) been discharged from hospital due to an acute exacerbation of COPD

          6. Ability to perform pulmonary function testing and with documented fixed airway
             obstruction determined by an FEV1 /FVC [forced vital capacity] ratio
             (post-bronchodilator) of &lt;0.70 and a predicted FEV1 value of 30%-80% of normal within
             the 6 months prior to Visit 1.

          5. Hospitalisation for more than 7 days for current acute exacerbation, or the
             requirement for intubation during hospitalisation

          6. For outpatients, prior medical history indicating that previous exacerbations
             required &gt;3 weeks to stabilise
