  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at significantly higher risk for death due
      to cardiovascular disease. Those with paradoxical increases in blood pressure (BP) during
      hemodialysis (HD), defined as intradialytic hypertension (IDH), are at even greater risk of
      cardiovascular mortality. This study seeks to determine the mechanisms that underlie IDH,
      and whether mindfulness meditation might improve BP during dialysis in these patients. The
      investigators will first determine if increased adrenaline levels during volume removal
      contributes to IDH. The investigators will then determine lack of suppression of adrenaline
      levels in the setting of a high BP also contributes to IDH. This will be done by
      manipulating blood pressure by using small amounts of vasoactive drugs, and determining if
      an appropriate response in adrenaline levels occurs. Lastly, the investigators will
      determine if an intradialytic mindfulness meditation program improves BP and adrenaline
      levels in ESRD patients with IDH.

    <description>After individual instruction, participants in this arm will perform meditation by following a series of MM recordings during hemodialysis for the next 4 to 8 weeks.The MM instructor will also meet with the participants weekly to provide continued instruction. Participants will also be encouraged to perform MM using the MP3 player at home on non-dialysis days, and asked to keep a log of these sessions.</description>
