    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      oral selinexor in patients with recurrent gliomas.

      Initially, the study included 2 arms: an exploratory Surgical Arm (Arm A) with sequential
      enrollment for patients who require surgery and a medical arm (Arm B) for patients who are
      not eligible for surgery.

      Enrollment in Arm B was stopped to explore alternative dosing in Protocol Versions â‰¥ 4.0 to
      potentially improve tolerability. Four arms (Arms C, D, E, and F) were added to the Medical
      Arm in Protocol Version 4.0. Patients in the primary population enrolled under Protocol
      Version 4.0 or above will be randomized to Arm C and Arm D (approximately 30 patients per
      arm) to explore alternative dosing to potentially improve tolerability. Patients with
      malignant gliomas other than glioblastoma (GBM) (Arm E; approximately 20 patients) and
      patients with GBM or AG that is refractory to antiangiogenic treatment (Arm F; approximately
      10 patients) will be enrolled to evaluate preliminary evidence of the efficacy of Selinexor
      in those exploratory populations.

      After screening and registration/randomization in the study, patients enrolling in Arms A
      and E or randomized to Arm C will receive 60 mg Selinexor orally twice weekly. Patients
      randomized to Arm D will receive 80 mg Selinexor orally weekly. Enrollment in Arm F will not
      begin until the first stage results for Arms C and D are available. Dosing for Arm F will be
      selected based on the first stage results for Arms C and D.

      Patients will be treated until progression of disease or the development of unacceptable
      toxicities. All patients will then undergo the End of Treatment (EOT) visit.
