                  trastuzumab-containing treatment and progressed on trastuzumab, pertuzumab, a
                  taxane, and/or trastuzumab emtansine. There is no limit regarding the number of

                  inhibitor and/or an aromatase inhibitor plus palbociclib. Prior treatment with
                  tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant setting is allowed but must have been discontinued
                  for at least 1 year prior to the first dose.
