    <textblock>
      Cystoid macular edema is a condition in which there is swelling in the macula, the part of
      the retina that gives you your best vision. This swelling can cause your vision to get bad.
      When it is diagnosed early and treated, you vision usually can be preserved. However, if the
      swelling goes untreated for several months, it can cause permanent vision loss.

      We think that the two eyedrop regimens in this study, difluprednate or nepafenac plus
      prednisolone, might be effective in treating uveitic macular edema. Patients who enter this
      study are being randomized to one of the two regimens and are being followed for one month.

      Randomized, observer-masked superiority trial of difluprednate 0.05% versus nepafenac 0.1%
      plus prednisolone acetate 1%.

      Patients will be randomized at enrollment to either difluprednate 0.05% 6 times a day or
      prednisolone acetate 1% 6 times a day plus nepafenac 0.1% 3 times a day for 1 month. They
      will undergo repeat examination at 2 weeks post-enrollment (range 12 to 16 days) and at 4
      weeks post-enrollment (range 25-35 days). The OCT, visual acuity and intraocular pressure
      examiner will be masked as to the patient's assignment. The treating physician and patient
      will be unmasked.
