  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our group has recently found that the choice of positive airway pressure mask can
      significantly affect the pressure required to adequately treat sleep disordered breathing.
      The goal of this study is to visualize the upper airway in the retropalatal and retroglossal
      region while using both oronasal and nasal masks with CPAP in order to investigate
      differences in upper airway dynamics that may occur between these two mask types.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that oronasal masks are not as effective at opening the upper airway compared to
      nasal only continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks in patients with
      sleep-disordered breathing. However, the physiological mechanism for this difference in
      efficacy is not known; although, it has been hypothesized to involve the retroglossal and/or
      retropalatal region of the upper airway. The objective of this study was to investigate
      differences in retroglossal and retropalatal anterior-posterior space with the use of
      oronasal vs. nasal CPAP masks using real-time cine magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI).
