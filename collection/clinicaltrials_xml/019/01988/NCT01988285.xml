      Purpose: To validate our previously developed model of risk factors for diagnosis of
      eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and to assess the utility of serum levels of biomarkers in
      diagnosis and monitoring of treatment of EoE. Participants: Up to a total of 800
      participants (approximately 400 with EoE and 400 without EoE) who are referred for upper
      endoscopy. Procedures: This is a prospective cohort study. Patients will be compared with
      newly diagnosed EoE to non-EoE controls, obtain baseline measures, reassess EoE patients
      after treatment, and also reassess untreated controls. Data collection will include
      questionnaire results, blood collection, and tissue collection (esophageal biopsies
      performed during upper endoscopy per pre-specified protocol). Blood will be analyzed for the
      presence of the candidate biomarkers. Patients will be compared with newly diagnosed EoE to
      non-EoE controls, obtain baseline measures, reassess EoE patients after treatment, and also
      reassess untreated controls. Data collection will include questionnaire results, blood
      collection, possible saliva collection, possible urine collection, and tissue collection
      (esophageal biopsies performed during upper endoscopy per pre-specified protocol). Blood
      will be analyzed for the presence of the candidate biomarkers, including eotaxin-3 and
      IL-13.

    <description>To validate our model of clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic risk factors for diagnosis of EoE by calculating the EoE risk score which includes subject's age, allergic conditions, endoscopic findings, and eosinophil count. Subject's EoE risk scores will be compared between EoE patients and two non-EoE control groups: patients with dysphagia and patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who are not responsive to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.</description>

    <description>The prospective longitudinal group will be subjects who have a positive EoE diagnosis during initial endoscopy. This prospective group will be followed up at their clinically indicated endoscopy after their standard of care clinical therapy of swallowed steroids.
Prospective longitudinal participants will receive biopsies prior to their standard of care clinical therapy of swallowed steroids and at their clinically indicated follow up upper endoscopy.</description>

        The source of the study population will be patients aged 18-80 presenting at the
        gastrointestinal (Gl) Endoscopy Clinic at UNC-Chapel Hill for elective upper endoscopy
        with a primary or secondary indication of dysphagia and/or reflux symptoms. Any patient
        undergoing endoscopy with dysphagia and/or reflux symptoms is eligible to participate in
        the study.

             nausea, or vomiting).

          2. Age 18 or older

        Exclusion Criteria:
