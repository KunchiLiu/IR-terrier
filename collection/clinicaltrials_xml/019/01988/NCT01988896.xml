    <textblock>
      A Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of coadministration of intravenous (IV) dosing of atezolizumab (an
      engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [anti PD-L1] antibody) and oral dosing of
      cobimetinib in participants with metastatic or locally advanced cancer for which no standard
      therapy exists.
