      This clinical trial will compare how the individualized and fortified human milk feeding
      will help a premature infant grow.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 premature infants who will be randomized to receive either a standard
      fortification regimen (n=30) or an adjustable fortification regimen (n=30). The adjustable
      fortification regimen encompasses increasing / decreasing the amount of fortifier and adding
      supplemental protein guided by periodic determinations of the protein concentration in human
      milk (PCHM), body weight and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Growth rate, tolerance of enteral
      feeding, days to achieve 100kcal/kg/d through enteral feeding, length of parenteral
      nutrition and NICU stays will be measured and compared between groups.
