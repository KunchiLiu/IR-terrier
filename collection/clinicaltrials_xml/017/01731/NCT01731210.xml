        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Approved indication per ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines for implantation of a CRT-D system for
             treatment of heart failure or life threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia(s)

          -  Receiving a new implant OR undergoing an upgrade from an existing ICD or pacemaker
             implant with no prior implanted LV lead OR undergoing a new LV implant attempt
             consecutive to a recent LV lead placement failure not related to coronary sinus
             cannulation failure

          -  Patient receiving the PARADYM RF CRT or PARADYM RF CRT SONR devices

          -  Ability to provide informed consent for study participation and is willing and able
             to comply with the prescribed follow-up tests and schedule of evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ventricular tachyarrhythmia of transient or reversible causes such as acute
             myocardial infarction, digitalis intoxication, drowning, electrocution, electrolyte
             imbalance, hypoxia or sepsis, uncorrected at the time of the enrolment;

          -  Incessant Ventricular tachyarrhythmias;

          -  Unstable angina, or acute MI , CABG , or PTCA within the past 4 weeks;

          -  Correctable valvular disease that is the primary cause of heart failure;

          -  Post heart transplant (patients who are waiting for a heart transplant are allowed in
             the study);

          -  Patient who had previously a permanently implanted LV lead;

          -  Concurrent implant with another pacemaker or ICD (previously implanted pacemaker or
             ICD devices should be removed prior to implant with the Paradym RF CRT-D or Paradym
             RF CRT SONR);

          -  Already included in another clinical study that could confound the results of this
             study;

          -  Life expectancy less than 1 year.
