  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term, open-label study of the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of RP103
      in cystinosis patients who are naïve to any form of cysteamine treatment. Subjects will
      receive RP103 treatment for at least 12 months. US subjects will transition to the
      commercially approved drug PROCYSBI®. In Brazil, after at least 12 months of study
      participation and upon approval by the Brazilian regulatory authorities, subjects will be
      eligible to transition to a post study drug supply program, and continue to receive the drug
      at no personal cost.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information about the safety and effectiveness (how
      well it works to treat cystinosis) of a new drug called RP103.

      In cystinosis, the body builds up cystine. When taken regularly, the active ingredient of an
      older, already approved drug called Cystagon® (cysteamine bitartrate) reduces cystine in the
      body. RP103 has the same active ingredient as Cystagon® and is designed to reduce cystine in
      a similar way that Cystagon® does. RP103 is also different from Cystagon®: Instead of the
      cysteamine bitartrate being absorbed from the stomach, RP103 is designed to be absorbed from
      the small intestine. This may make the effects of the drug last longer, so that it can be
      taken twice a day instead of four times a day like Cystagon®.

      To decide if RP103 is effective, the study will look at two types of blood tests. One test
      is pharmacodynamics (PD), which measures the amount of white blood cell (WBC) cystine after
      taking study drug. WBC cystine is a laboratory test used to find out if cysteamine
      bitartrate is reducing cystine levels in the body. The second test is pharmacokinetics (PK),
      which measures the amount of cysteamine in the blood after taking the drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female with a documented diagnosis of cystinosis

             and AST, and/or 1.5 times ULN for total bilirubin, within 6 months prior to Screening

          -  No clinically significant change in renal function, i.e. estimated GFR within 6
             months prior to Screening

          -  Must have an estimated GFR &gt; 20 mL/minute/1.73m2 (using the equation from Schwartz
             2009 J Am Soc Nephrol 20:629-647)
