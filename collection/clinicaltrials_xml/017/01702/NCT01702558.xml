  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study will assess the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine in combination
      with Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) in participants with HER2-positive mBC or HER2-positive
      LA/mGC using a Phase I design, followed by a randomized, open-label Phase II study to
      explore the efficacy and safety of the combination of Kadcyla and capecitabine compared with
      Kadcyla alone in mBC. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression,
      intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.
