  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant
      Avastin (bevacizumab) in participants with initially unresectable, FIGO stage IIIC/IV
      ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive 8 cycles of
      carboplatin plus paclitaxel with or without Avastin 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg)
      intravenously every 3 weeks in Cycles 1 to 3 before surgery. All participants will receive
      Avastin 15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for Cycles 6 to 26. Anticipated time on study
      treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs, for up to a maximum
      of 26 cycles.

    <description>Participants will receive 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy prior to IDS and 22 cycles of adjuvant therapy before entering long-term follow-up. Each cycle will be 3 weeks in length. Carboplatin and paclitaxel will be administered during Cycles 1 to 8. Bevacizumab will be administered during both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment periods in Cycles 1 to 26 (no treatment in Cycles 4 and 5).</description>
