    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate if pregabalin is effective in treating neuropathic
      (nerve) pain resulting from peripheral nerve trauma due to a traumatic or surgical event
      such as, for example, motor vehicle accident, fall, sports injury, knee or hip replacement,
      hernia repair, thoracotomy, mastectomy, focal/localized burns or crush injury.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have chronic peripheral neuropathic pain present for than 6 months
             after a traumatic or surgical event such as, for example, motor vehicle accident,
             fall, sports injury, knee or hip replacement, hernia repair, thoracotomy, mastectomy,
             focal/localized burns or crush injury.

          -  Subjects must be literate and have the ability (unaided) to understand and use the
             interactive voice response system (IVRS), have daily access to a telephone in order
             to complete the IVRS assessments each day, perform telephone visits and complete all
             required assessments/forms.

          -  Subjects must have sufficient post-traumatic neuropathic pain at screening and
             baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with neuropathic pain due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), post
             herpetic neuralgia (PHN), HIV, trigeminal neuralgia (TGN), carpal tunnel syndrome
             (CTS) or with central neuropathic pain (for example, due to spinal cord injury) or
             with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS, Type I or Type II).

          -  Subjects with other pain that may confound assessment or self-evaluation of the
             peripheral neuropathic pain.

          -  Subjects who have failed pregabalin treatment due to lack of efficacy with an
             adequate course of therapy at doses greater than or equal to 150 mg/day, who have
             previously participated in a pregabalin clinical trial or who have been treated with
             pregabalin at any time during the 6 month period prior to screening.

          -  Subjects with epilepsy; pernicious anemia; hematological illnesses; known HIV
             infection; any clinically unstable cardiovascular (including a myocardial infarction
             [heart attack] in the 3 months prior to screening), hematological, autoimmune,
             endocrine, renal, hepatic (including chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis B within the 3
             months prior to screening) respiratory, or gastrointestinal disease; symptomatic
             peripheral vascular disease including intermittent claudication; uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus; untreated hypothyroidism.

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of DSM-IV TR Axis I disorder (including, for example,
             schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) with the exceptions of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
             (GAD) or major depression that is clinically stable.

          -  Subjects considered at risk of suicide or self-harm based on investigator judgment
             and/or details of a risk assessment.

          -  Use of prohibited medications in the absence of appropriate washout periods.
