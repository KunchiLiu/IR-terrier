    <textblock>
      The ABSORB III RCT is a prospective randomized, single-blind, multi-center trial. It is the
      pivotal trial to support the US pre-market approval (PMA) of Absorb™ Bioresorbable Vascular
      Scaffold (BVS).

      The ABSORB III includes additional two trials i.e. ABSORB III PK (pharmacokinetics)
      sub-study and ABSORB IV RCT trial which are maintained under one protocol because both trial
      designs are related, ABSORB IV is the continuation of ABSORB III and the data from ABSORB
      III and ABSORB IV will be pooled to support the ABSORB IV primary endpoint. Both the trials
      will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Absorb BVS.

      ABSORB III RCT:

      A. Primary Objective: The pivotal trial to support the US pre-market approval (PMA) of
      Absorb BVS. ABSORB III will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Absorb BVS System
      compared to the XIENCE in the treatment of subjects, including those with diabetes mellitus,
      with ischemic heart disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery lesions in
      separate epicardial vessels.

      B. Powered Secondary Objectives:

        1. Lead-In Phase Objective: To evaluate the applicability and transferability of the
           didactic Absorb BVS physician training plan to US clinical practice.

           The lead-in phase is a non-randomized, single-arm, open label group of up to 50
           subjects treated with Absorb BVS at up to 35 US sites. The Lead-In phase will
           enroll/register subjects prior to the randomization phase of ABSORB III.

           The Lead-In Phase allows the treatment of up to two de novo native coronary artery
           lesions in different epicardial vessels with reference vessel diameter (RVD) ≥ 2.75 mm
           to ≤ 3.25 mm and lesion lengths ≥ 8 to ≤ 14 mm.

        2. Imaging Cohort Objective: To evaluate long-term vascular function and patency of the
           Absorb BVS treated segments compared to XIENCE treated segments in the treatment of
           subjects with ischemic heart disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery
           lesions in separate epicardial vessels.

      The imaging cohort-phase is a prospective, randomized (2:1 Absorb BVS to XIENCE),
      single-blind, multi-center trial, registering approximately 200 subjects. This includes 150
      subjects for the angiographic/intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) endpoints analysis and
      approximately 50 subjects for optical coherence tomography (OCT) endpoints analysis. The 200
      subjects are separate from the 2000 subjects included in the primary analysis. Data from two
      powered secondary endpoints from this cohort will support label claims of superiority of
      Absorb BVS as compared to XIENCE specific to vasomotion and late lumen enlargement.

      All other subjects in ABSORB III unless specified will receive treatment of up to two de
      novo native coronary artery lesions in different epicardial vessels with RVD ≥ 2.5 mm to ≤
      3.75 mm and lesion lengths ≤ 24 mm.

    <measure>Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at 1 year, non-inferiority (NI) against the control.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>TLF is defined as composite of Cardiac Death, Myocardial Infarction (per protocol-defined MI definition), attributable to Target Vessel (TV-MI), or Ischemic-Driven Target Lesion Revascularization (ID-TLR).
Sample size of 1900 subjects is required for the study (2:1 randomization); 1267 subjects for Absorb BVS arm and 633 subjects for XIENCE arm. Assuming a 5% dropout rate approximately 2,000 subjects will be required
The ABSORB III primary endpoint of TLF at 1-year follow up will be analyzed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) and the per-treatment evaluable (PTE) populations. The primary analysis will be based on the ITT population. The non-inferiority hypothesis testing will be performed using a non-inferiority test statistic by Farrington and Manning. Non-inferiority of Absorb BVS to XIENCE will be established if the p-value for the non-inferiority test is less than 0.025.</description>
