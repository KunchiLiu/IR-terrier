      The purpose of this study is to compare IV acetaminophen to oral acetaminophen for pain
      control in children undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy.

    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy is a common surgical procedure in children and
      adolescents. Usually performed for recurrent tonsillitis or symptoms of airway obstruction,
      the procedure can result in significant post-operative pain. Common analgesic techniques
      include the use of oral acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID, such as
      ibuprofen PO or ketorolac IV), and narcotics. Acetaminophen has been shown to be effective
      in reducing pain and post-operative opioid requirements. Its administration can be oral,
      rectal, or intravenous. NSAIDs, though effective for pain control, have been shown to
      increase bleeding risk and disrupt hemostasis. Narcotics are effective for pain control but
      increase the risk of nausea and vomiting. They also have the potential to cause respiratory
      depression.

      IV acetaminophen (OFIRMEV) is indicated for management of mild to moderate pain, and as an
      adjunct to opioids for severe pain. Several studies have examined the efficacy of IV
      acetaminophen vs placebo and/or active controls (meperidine, rectal acetaminophen (PR),
      tramadol). IV acetaminophen has been shown to be superior to placebo for pain control.
      Though there is data regarding peak plasma and Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) concentration of
      acetaminophen when given by different routes (PO vs IV vs PR), there is no data comparing
      the efficacy of oral vs IV administration for pain control post-tonsillectomy in children.
