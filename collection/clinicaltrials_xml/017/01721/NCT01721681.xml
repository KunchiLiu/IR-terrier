      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of FACTOR X in the prevention
      of bleeding when given as routine prophylaxis over 12 months.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        1. To assess the pharmacokinetics of FACTOR X after a single dose of 50 IU/kg.

        2. To assess the safety of FACTOR X when given as routine prophylaxis over 6 months (26
           weeks).

    <measure>The investigator's assessment of the efficacy of FACTOR X in the reduction/prevention of bleeding when given as routine prophylaxis over 6 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will take into account the child's risk of breakthrough bleeding (due to bleeding history, treatment history and genetic mutation) and other relevant factors eg compliance with the protocol, attainment of required factor X activity trough levels. Retrospective data will be included in the analysis as supportive data.</description>

    <description>At the Baseline Visit, eligible children will receive a bolus dose of 50 IU/kg FACTOR X. After the Baseline Visit, children will be treated with FACTOR X prophylactically for a period of 6 months (26 weeks).
A dosing regimen of 40-50 IU/kg twice a week is recommended, but is not mandatory. Each dose of FACTOR X must not exceed 60 IU/kg.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Children with hereditary severe or moderate FX deficiency (FX:C &lt;5 IU/dL), based on
             their lowest reliable FX:C recorded.

          2. Children under 12 years old, whose parent/guardian has given informed consent.

          3. Children with a history of severe bleeding e.g.: intracranial haemorrhage, before
             starting prophylactic therapy, OR a mutation in the F10 gene causing a documented
             severe bleeding phenotype.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Children must not suffer from clinically significant liver disease, renal disease, or
             other coagulopathy or thrombophilia

          2. Children must have no history or suspicion of inhibitors to factor X.

          3. Children who have known or suspected hypersensitivity to the investigational
             medicinal product or its excipients.

          4. Children with a history of unreliability or non-cooperation.

          5. Children who are participating or have taken part in another trial within the last 30
             days.

          6. Children planning more than 4 weeks' continuous absence from the locality of the
             investigational site, between the Screening Visit and the End of Study Visit at
             approximately 6 months (26 weeks) post-Baseline.
