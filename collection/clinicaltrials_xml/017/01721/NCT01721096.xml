      The objectives of the PMS are to observe the frequency, type, and degree of device
      deficiency to assure the safety of the new medical device (XIENCE PRIME) as well as to
      collect information on evaluation of the efficacy and safety for reevaluation.

      The primary objectives of the PMS are to observe the frequency, type, and degree of device
      deficiency to assure the safety of the new medical device (XIENCE PRIME) as well as to
      collect information on evaluation of the efficacy and safety for reevaluation by
      Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA).
