    <textblock>
      Post-menopausal women with hormone-receptor positive (HR+) metastatic breast cancer
      resistant to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy will be randomized to receive Fulvestrant
      (Faslodex) with Everolimus or Fulvestrant (Faslodex) with a placebo (no active ingredients).

      Fulvestrant has demonstrated activity when used as first, second, or third line endocrine
      therapy, making it an attractive therapy for combination with other agents. In addition, it
      is commonly reserved for use following disease progression on AI therapy.

      Everolimus is an orally administered drug that blocks a signaling pathway called &quot;mTOR&quot;.
      &quot;mTOR&quot; acts as a regulator for many processes in the body, including cell growth. Blocking
      this pathway may have an effect on cell growth.

      The combination of a novel class of agents (mTOR inhibitors) and an established standard
      treatment for metastatic HR+ breast cancer may potentially increase the clinical benefit by
      targeting multiple different biological pathways.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide. In the United
      States, an estimated 230,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed in 2011,
      with 39,520 breast cancer deaths. In 40-80% of women with node-positive disease at
      diagnosis, their breast cancer will recur. When distant metastases occur, median survival is
      18 to 36 months from time of recurrence. Among the 60-70% of women with HR+ breast cancer,
      40-60% of them will benefit from endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapy has shown to yield
      similar survival rates in hormone-sensitive disease as compared to chemotherapy; although
      response rates are lower and responses develop more slowly. Endocrine therapy is
      considerably less toxic than chemotherapy, and is therefore the preferred treatment option
      for patients with HR+ disease.

      Endocrine therapy represents the foundation of treatment for HR+ metastatic and locally
      advanced breast cancer. Multiple compounds in varying classes exist, and those most widely
      used include the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), aromatase inhibitors (AIs),
      and the selective estrogen receptor down-regulators (SERDs). Although the utility of these
      drugs is well established, as many as 50% of women with HR+ breast cancer will fail to
      respond to endocrine treatment. Moreover, those who do respond will inevitably develop
      acquired resistance.

      Fulvestrant is the first drug which acts as a pure estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist without
      known agonist effects. It competitively binds to the ERs with an approximately 100 times
      greater affinity than that of tamoxifen. Fulvestrant promotes the degradation of ERs and
      subsequently prevents ER-mediated gene transcription.

      Everolimus (RAD001) is an oral derivative of rapamycin that is an m-TOR inhibitor. At
      cellular and molecular levels, everolimus acts as a signal transduction inhibitor.
      Everolimus selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin); a key and highly
      conserved serine-threonine kinase which is present in all cells and is a central regulator
      of protein synthesis and ultimately cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and cell
      survival. mTOR is the only currently known target of everolimus.

      In oncology, everolimus has been in clinical development since 2002 for patients with
      various hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies as a single agent or in combination
      with antitumor agents, including cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapies,
      antibodies and hormonal agents.

      Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive everolimus or placebo with fulvestrant after
      consideration of stratification factors of performance status (0 vs. 1), measurable disease
      (with or without non-measurable) vs. non-measurable disease, and prior chemotherapy for
      metastatic disease vs. no prior chemotherapy.

      Patients will be evaluated for disease response every 12 weeks and treated until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity for a total of 12 cycles.

      Patients with no evidence of progressive disease who remain on study after completing 12
      cycles are unblinded and continue to receive fulvestrant alone (if originally randomized to
      placebo) or in combination with everolimus (if originally randomized to everolimus) at the
      same dose and schedule. Patients will continue to be evaluated for disease response every 12
      weeks and continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
