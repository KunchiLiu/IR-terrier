    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study will evaluate the routine use and the safety and efficacy of
      Avastin (bevacizumab) as first-line treatment in patients with advanced ovarian cancer
      (epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma). Newly
      diagnosed patients who are initiated on carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy in combination
      with Avastin will be followed for up to 15 months of treatment and 12 months of follow-up.
