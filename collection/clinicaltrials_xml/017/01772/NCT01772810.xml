      This is a safety study of human spinal cord-derived neural stem cell (HSSC) transplantation
      for the treatment of chronic spinal cord injury.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, single-site, safety study of human spinal cord-derived neural
      stem cell (HSSC) transplantation for the treatment of chronic spinal cord injury (SCI)
      defined as at least one year but no more than 2 years after traumatic SCI. A maximum of 4
      subjects with chronic SCI with American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A
      who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled. No control group will be included. All
      subjects will receive spinal cord injections of HSSC: Group A: 4 patients with T2-T12 cord
      injury. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be convened at approximately
      1 month (4 weeks) intervals after the first subject and will review all available safety
      data for all treated subjects. Study duration will be for 6 months for each subject. Post
      study, all subjects will be followed for additional 54 months by bi-annual visits during
      which safety assessments will be conducted as specified in the protocol.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome measure of the study is to determine the incidence of Adverse Events including serious adverse events (SAEs) and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.</measure>
    <time_frame>The primary outcome measure will be assessed over the 6 month study period.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the incidence of adverse events in the study population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome measure of the study is to evaluate the graft survival in the transplant site as determined by MRI (with and without gadolinium contrast) and via autopsy, if one is completed.</measure>
    <time_frame>An MRI will be performed at Visits 1, 3, 5, 7, and 11 through 22.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measures of the study are to evaluate graft survival in the transplant site and to determine the effectiveness of immunosuppression as determined by absence of donor-specific HLA antibodies.</description>

    <measure>Exploratory Outcome Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>The exploratory outcome measures of the study will be assessed over a 60 month period.</time_frame>
    <description>The exploratory outcome measure of the study is to compare baseline sensory and motor index scores to post HSSC transplantation sensory and motor index scores. Baseline bowel and bladder function scores compared to the bowel and bladder function scores post transplantation. Baseline evoked sensory or motor potentials or EMG compared to post transplantation evoked potentials or EMG.</description>
