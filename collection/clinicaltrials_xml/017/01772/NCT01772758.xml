    <textblock>
      Perhaps one of the most disturbing aspects of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the associated
      premature death. Oxidative stress has been observed in patients with CF and exercise
      intolerance has been shown to predict mortality in patients with CF, regardless of how
      healthy their lungs are. A critical barrier to improving the quality of life and longevity
      in patients with CF is our lack of knowledge regarding the different reasons why patients
      with CF cannot exercise to the level of their peers. We have collected preliminary data to
      support our central hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes to the impairment in blood
      vessel function at rest and during exercise which ultimately oxygen transport and delivery
      resulting in exercise intolerance. Exercise is therapeutic medicine for patients with CF and
      this investigation represents a major breakthrough in the approach to begin understanding
      the physiological mechanisms which contribute to exercise intolerance in these patients.

      There have been major advances in research and medical therapies to target improvements in
      lung function; however, non-pulmonary factors have been neglected. Based on our recent
      discovery that patients with CF have systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction, it is
      reasonable to suspect the involvement of the blood vessels in the pathophysiology of
      exercise intolerance in CF - a concept that has yet to be examined. Thus the overall goals
      of this proposal are to provide mechanistic evidence that oxidative stress contributes to 1)
      endothelial dysfunction and 2) exercise intolerance in patients with CF. Our central
      hypothesis is that cystic fibrosis facilitates a whole body oxidative stress which
      contributes independently to both endothelial dysfunction and exercise intolerance. In
      support of our central hypothesis, we have generated compelling preliminary data to
      demonstrate the efficacy of antioxidants to improve endothelial function and exercise
      capacity in patients with CF. In addition, we have identified a robust inverse relationship
      between oxidative stress and exercise intolerance in patients with CF, such that patients
      with the highest basal levels of oxidative stress have the lowest exercise capacity.
      Further, we have identified that patients with CF have an exaggerated oxidative stress
      response to sub-maximal exercise when compared to healthy controls. Specific Aim 1: To test
      the hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes to endothelial dysfunction in patients with
      cystic fibrosis Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), microvascular function, and
      markers of oxidant status (alkoxyl and ascorbyl free radical, 8-isoprostane, lipid
      hydroperoxide, total antioxidant capacity, and lipid soluble antioxidants) will be measured
      at baseline and 2 hours following the ingestion of an oral anti-oxidant cocktail (vitamin C,
      E, alpha-lipoic acid) or placebo cocktail (double blind, randomized, cross-over design) in
      patients with CF. Based on our preliminary data, we predict that the antioxidant cocktail
      will restore endothelial function and oxidant status to control values, whereas no change
      will be observed following placebo. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that oxidative
      stress contributes to exercise intolerance in patients with cystic fibrosis Exercise
      capacity (VO2 peak) and indices of gas exchange (O2 uptake kinetics, expired CO2, VE/VO2,
      VE/VCO2) will be determined using the Godfrey graded maximal exercise test on a cycle
      ergometer 2 hours following the ingestion of either an antioxidant cocktail or placebo
      cocktail (double blind, randomized, cross-over design) in patients with CF. Based on our
      preliminary data, we predict that patients with CF will exhibit an improvement in exercise
      capacity following the antioxidant cocktail, whereas no change will be observed following
      the placebo cocktail. Specific Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that chronic dosing of an
      anti-oxidant cocktail will improve endothelial function and contribute to an improvement in
      exercise capacity in patients with cystic fibrosis Following completion of Aims 1 and 2,
      endothelial function, exercise capacity (VO2 peak), and the indices of gas exchange
      (indicated above), will be performed, only in patients with CF, at baseline, 4 weeks, 8
      weeks, and 12 weeks following an anti-oxidant cocktail taken once a day. Secondary outcomes
      will include measurements of arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity), the Physioflow
      Enduro, and biomarkers of nitric oxide bioavailability. This chronic experiment will test
      the mechanism that an increase in endothelial function will improve exercise capacity in CF.
