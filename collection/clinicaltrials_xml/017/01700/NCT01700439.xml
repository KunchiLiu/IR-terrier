      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center trial. Up to 950 subjects will be
      enrolled at up to 35 centers in the US. After re-placement of their aortic heart valve with
      the EDWARDS INTUITY valve system, each patient will have routine follow-up tests at the
      following intervals: discharge, 3 months, 1 year, and annually the-reafter for a minimum of
      five years.
