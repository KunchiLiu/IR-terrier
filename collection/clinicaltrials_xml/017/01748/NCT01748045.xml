    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if inhaled nitric oxide will improve short and long
      term respiratory outcomes in preterm infants. Infants born at a gestational age of 30-36
      weeks and who require breathing support with high flow nasal cannula, nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure, or nasal intermittent positive pressure will be randomized to
      receive either inhaled nitric oxide or placebo. The dose will then be decreased per protocol
      until all respiratory support has been discontinued. Infants will be followed to evaluate
      safety and efficacy of non-invasive iNO delivery, up to 12 months corrected gestational age.
