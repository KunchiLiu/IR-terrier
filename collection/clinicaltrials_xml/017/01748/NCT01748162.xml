      Presently children who experience recurring croup symptoms receive a variety of treatments.
      This is because it is not clear which treatments may be best. Some children are given
      inhaled steroids (similar to what children with asthma use). Others are carefully watched
      and cautioned to avoid potential triggers (certain foods, environmental allergens, etc), and
      should episodes of croup recur they are treated with a short course of oral steroids. The
      purpose of our study is to compare two safe and clinically appropriate methods for treating
      recurrent croup, daily inhaled steroids versus observation with oral steroids on an as
      needed basis, to see if either is useful in preventing future episodes of croup.
