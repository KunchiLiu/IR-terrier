    <measure>Adverse Cardiac Events on patients with genotype positive LQT1 who have a normal EKG and absence of symptoms, but a molecular confirmation of LQT1.</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment is expected to take approximately 5 years. The patients will be followed until they are no longer cared for by a pediatric cardiology facility (typically post-college) or approximately 21 years of age.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Cardiac Events on patients with both phenotype and genotype positive.</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment is expected to take approximately 5 years. The patients will be followed until they are no longer cared for by a pediatric cardiology facility (typically post-college) or approximately 21 years of age.</time_frame>
