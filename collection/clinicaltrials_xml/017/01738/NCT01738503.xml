  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study in treatment seeking opioid-dependent subjects for safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy markers, and opioid receptor availability of
      subcutaneous injections of depot buprenorphine after induction and stabilization of
      treatment seeking subjects onto Subutex.

    <description>Participants are stabilized by day -5 on Subutex 24 mg. During the study, four subcutaneous (SC) injections containing RBP-6000 200 mg are given at 28 day intervals.
Participants who receive RBP-6000 containing 200 mg buprenorphine and reach Day 112 (and have received all 4 planned SC injections) will have the option to participate in the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Pilot substudy. In the PET Pilot sub-study participants will remain on 200 mg SC injections at 28 day intervals for an additional 6-9 intervals until they complete an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a PET scan and pharmacokinetic samples at week 1 and week 4 post injection.</description>
