    <textblock>
      This is a pilot cohort study of women undergoing focal ablation for high-grade cervical
      intraepithelial neoplasia (HGCIN). The cohort was recruited from the UCSF Dysplasia Clinics.
      The standard treatment involves treatment of the entire cervix. Women with HGCIN meeting
      inclusion criteria were recruited for enrollment into the pilot study of focal treatment.
      Upon enrollment, they underwent focal ablational treatment rather than standard ablational
      treatment of the cervix. Follow-up visits were conducted at 2 weeks and 6 months to assess
      safety, feasibility, and acceptability. The 6-month recurrence rate of HGCIN will be
      calculated.
