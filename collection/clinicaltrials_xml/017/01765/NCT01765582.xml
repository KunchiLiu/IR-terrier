    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      folinic acid (leucovorin), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) /
      bevacizumab regimens (concurrent and sequential) versus folinic acid (leucovorin),
      5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) / bevacizumab in first-line in participants with
      metastatic colorectal cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive bevacizumab 5
      milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously every 2 weeks with either concurrent or
      sequential FOLFOXIRI or with FOLFOX for 4 to 6 months of induction therapy, followed by
      maintenance therapy with bevacizumab plus either leucovorin/5-fluorouracil or capecitabine
      until disease progression occurs. After disease progression, participants will receive
      treatment with a fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab.
