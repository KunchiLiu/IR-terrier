      Background: Inadequate representation of elderly cancer patients in randomized clinical
      trials (RCTs) leading to a lack of external validity thereby an uncertainty regarding
      benefit-risk balance of cancer treatment in elderly, especially chemotherapy.

      Hypothesis: The eligibility criteria explain only a part of the under-representation of
      elderly patients in trials. We make the assumptions that 1) Among the eligible, the
      invitation to participate in a trial and inclusion are inversely related to age, 2) Among
      the eligible, there are patients, practitioner, or organization factors that would explain
      the non inclusion of elderly patients.

      Objectives:

      1) To assess, in elderly patients with colorectal cancer, the proportions of patients:

        1. eligible at least to one RCT

        2. invited to participate

        3. included 2)

      a) Compare proportions among elderly patients to those of the comparator group of &quot;young&quot;
      subjects (age ≥ 18 and &lt;65 years) (added by amendment n°3 - 02/2014) b)To identify factors
      associated with the non-invitation and the non-inclusion in RCT.

      Material and methods:

      Study design: A multicentric prospective cohort survey Population: all patients aged 18
      years or more (added by amendment n°3 - 02/2014) with a colorectal cancer followed in one of
      the participating centers.

      Data collection:

        -  At baseline: Patient characteristics (including SOCIO-demographic, oncologic and
           geriatric data) will be collected. Organization factors (e.g. clinical research team)
           will be collected.

        -  Follow-up: the patient will be followed for potential invitation and inclusion in one
           RCT. Reasons of non-invitation or non-inclusion will be assessed.

      Number of subjects needed: 696 Number of centers : 7 (added by amendment n°3 - 02/2014)

      Ethical aspects: each patient will give his oral informed consent. The International Review
      Board of Mondor Hospital (CPP Ile-de-France IX) gave its approval in December 2012.
