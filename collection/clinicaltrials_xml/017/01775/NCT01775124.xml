  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different dosing regimens of
      ranibizumab (either monthly injections or injections as-needed based on the stability of a
      patient's vision) in Chinese patients with wet AMD . This study is to provide long-term
      safety data in the treatment of Chinese patients with wet AMD.

    <measure>Average change in Visual Acuity (Letters) from Month 3 through Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 through Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed at every study visit using best correction determined from protocol refraction. VA measurements (number of letters correctly identified) were performed with the patient in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like VA testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters. This outcome measure describes the difference between the VA averaged across all visits from Month 4 through 12 and the Month 3 Level of Visual Acuity (Letters) of the Study Eye. The treatment regimen up to Month 3 is the same in both treatment groups.</description>

    <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed on both eyes during every study visit using best correction determined from protocol refraction. VA measurements (number of letters correctly identified) were performed with the patient in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters.

    <description>Visual acuity (VA) was at every study visit using best correction determined from protocol refraction. VA measurements (number of letters correctly identified) were performed with the patient in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters. This outcome measure describes for each post-baseline month whether or not a patient improved by equal or more than 5, 10, 15,or 30 letters of VA as compared to baseline.</description>
