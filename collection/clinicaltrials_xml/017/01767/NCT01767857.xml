  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the True Human Monoclonal antibody Xilonix
      (MABp1) can prolong the life of colorectal carcinoma patients that are refractory to
      standard therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the setting of refractory, metastatic disease a complete resolution of tumor burden is
      not a reasonable expectation. Instead, the primary goal of anti-tumor therapy at this stage
      is to eliminate or reduce the symptomatic effects of the tumor, while trying to prolong
      survival for as long as possible. Due to treatment related morbidity however, few treatment
      modalities are ideal for this objective. Even with the most recent targeted agents (such as
      multi-kinase inhibitors), drug related toxicities frequently lead to relatively short
      treatment durations. With discontinuation of therapy, disease progression is uncontrolled
      and prognosis is poor.

      New agents that control disease progression—while improving tumor-related symptoms, rather
      than causing significant therapy related morbidity—are vitally needed to treat patients with
      advanced cancer, including those with colorectal cancer. An approach has been taken to
      develop such an agent using a monoclonal antibody to block the chronic inflammation involved
      in both malignant disease progression and constitutional symptoms.

      Xilonix™ is expected to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis by interrupting crucial signals
      that drive angiogenesis and invasiveness. The antibody therapy may also block tumor
      microenvironment infiltration by leukocytes (such as myeloid suppressor cells) that suppress
      antitumor immunity, enabling better host immune control of the disease. In addition to local
      effects on the tumor, Xilonix™ is expected to work systemically to correct the metabolic
      dysregulation, fatigue and anxiety mediated by chronic inflammatory signaling to the central
      nervous system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with pathologically confirmed colorectal carcinoma that is metastatic or
             unresectable and which is refractory to standard therapy. To be considered
             refractory, a subject must have experienced progression (or intolerance) after
             treatment with standard approved regimens including, oxaliplatin, irinotecan
             flouropyrimidine, bevacizumab, and cetuximab or panitumumab if KRAS wildtype.

          2. Subjects will not be treated with any radiation, chemotherapy, or investigational
             agents while enrolled in this protocol.
