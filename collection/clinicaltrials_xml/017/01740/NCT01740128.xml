  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with spinal cord injury (SCI) retain at least some movement below their injury,
      but their muscles often have a 'mind of their own'. Typical exercise programs focus on
      keeping muscles strong and flexible, but don't usually focus on helping patients control
      their muscles. The investigators' exercise research study will compare two different
      programs with the specific goal of improving conscious control of patients' muscles below
      the injury. This study focuses on those with 'chronic' SCI - the injury occurred at least
      one year prior to enrolling.

      This is a single center study taking place in the Bronx, NY.

      The first phase of the study will be observational - the investigators will analyze which
      nerve connections might remain partially intact through the injury (even if the nerves
      aren't consciously controlled). Participants with all severity of SCI may participate in
      this first phase.

      The second phase of the study will involve people who retain at least slight ability to move
      their legs and the ability to move the arms against gravity. Each person will undergo two
      different exercise rehabilitation strategies: weight-supported treadmill training; and
      balance training combined with skilled arm or hand exercises.

      The investigators will compare the effects of these exercise programs on a variety of
      outcomes, including gait speed, balance, strength, and muscle activation in response to
      brain stimulation.

      The investigators hypothesize that participants with chronic SCI undergoing combined
      balance/arm/hand training will show improved outcomes when compared to traditional gait or
      balance training.
