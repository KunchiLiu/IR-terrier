      Phase 1b of the study will evaluate the safety of talimogene laherparepvec in combination
      with ipilimumab. Phase 2 is a randomized study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      talimogene laherparepvec in combination with ipilimumab versus ipilumumab alone. Talimogene
      laherparepvec will be administered by intratumor injection, and ipilimumab will be
      administered by intravenous infusion for a total of 4 infusions. Subjects will be treated
      with talimogene laherparepvec until complete response, all injectable tumors have
      disappeared, disease progression per a modified Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC), or
      intolerance of study treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant melanoma.

          -  Stage IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a, IVM1b, or IVM1c disease that is not suitable for surgical
             resection

          -  Phase1: Treatment naïve: Must not have received any prior systemic anticancer
             treatment consisting of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy for
             unresected stage IIIB to IV melanoma.

          -  Phase 2: Either treatment naïve or received only one line of systemic anticancer
             therapy if BRAF wild-type or up to two lines of systemic anticancer therapy including
             one BRAF inhibitor-containing regimen if BRAF mutant. Treatments given in an adjuvant
             setting (eg, interferon, radiotherapy, isolated limb perfusion, or investigational
             agents) are not considered as prior lines of therapy. No prior talimogene
             laherparepvec, other oncolytic virus therapies, or tumor vaccines are allowed, even
             if given in the adjuvant setting.

          -  Phase 2: Subjects treated with prior ipilimumab must have had PR, CR, or at least 6
             months of stable disease followed by disease progression.

          -  Phase 2: Subjects previously treated with anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies must not
             have discontinued therapy due to any treatment-related adverse events including
             immune-related adverse events. Prior treatment-related adverse events should also be
             fully resolved and not requiring treatment for at least 28 days prior to
             randomization.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, renal, and coagulation functions

        Exclusion Criteria:

             hereditary immune deficiency, organ transplant, or leukemia)

          -  Phase 1b: History or evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases

          -  Phase 2: Clinically active cerebral melanoma metastases. Subjects with up to 3
             cerebral metastases, and neurological performance status of 0 may be
             enrolled,provided that all lesions have been adequately treated with stereotactic
             radiation therapy, craniotomy, or Gamma knife therapy, with no evidence of
             progression, and have not required steroids, for at least 2 months prior to
             enrollment.

          -  History or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune disease (such as pneumonitis,
             glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease,
             systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, or other), or history of autoimmune
             disease that required systemic treatment (ie, use of corticosteroids,
             immunosuppressive drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune
             diseases) in past 2 months prior to enrollment. Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine
             for hypothyroidism, insulin for diabetes mellitus) is not considered a form of
             systemic treatment for autoimmune disease.

          -  History of or plan for splenectomy or splenic irradiation

          -  Active herpetic skin lesions or prior complications of HSV-1 infection (eg, herpetic
             keratitis or encephalitis).

          -  Requires intermittent or chronic systemic (intravenous or oral) treatment with an
             antiherpetic drug (eg, acyclovir), other than intermittent topical use

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease

          -  Known acute or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection

          -  Phase 1b: Prior talimogene laherparepvec, ipilimumab, other Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
             associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, or
             tumor vaccine

          -  Phase 2: Prior talimogene laherparepvec, other oncolytic virus therapies, or tumor
