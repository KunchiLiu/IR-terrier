  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether, on a background of optimal medical therapy, including ticagrelor,
      opening of all suitable narrowings or blockages found at the time of primary PCI for an
      acute heart attack is better than treating only the culprit lesion in patients with
      multi-vessel disease.

    <textblock>
      To determine whether, on a background of optimal medical therapy with low-dose ASA and
      ticagrelor, a strategy of complete revascularization involving staged PCI using drug eluting
      stents of all suitable non-infarct related artery lesions is superior to a strategy of
      culprit lesion-only revascularization in reducing the composite outcome of CV death or MI in
      patients with multi-vessel disease who have undergone successful culprit lesion primary PCI
      for STEMI.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women within 72 hours after successful PCI (preferably using a drug eluting
             stent) to the culprit lesion for STEMI. PCI for STEMI can be either primary PCI or
             rescue PCI for failed fibrinolysis or a combination strategy where PCI is performed
             routinely 3-12 hours after fibrinolysis AND

          2. Multi-vessel disease defined as at least 1 additional non-infarct related coronary
             artery lesion that is at least 2.5 mm in diameter that has not been stented as part
             of the primary PCI and that is amenable to successful treatment with PCI and has:

               -  At least 70% diameter stenosis (visual estimation) or

               -  At least 50% diameter stenosis (visual estimation) with fractional flow reserve
                  (FFR) â‰¤ 0.80

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Planned revascularization of non-culprit lesion

          2. Planned surgical revascularization

          3. Non-cardiovascular co-morbidity reducing life expectancy to &lt; 5 years

          4. Any factor precluding 5 year follow-up

          5. Prior Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery
