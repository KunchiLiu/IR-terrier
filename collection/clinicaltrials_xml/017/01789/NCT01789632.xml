  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Pilot study is a Multicenter, Randomized Trial comparing autologous platelet rich
      plasma (PRP) versus autologous whole blood versus dry needle tendon fenestration on pain and
      quality of life in patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow). We want to find out
      if pain and mobility are improved in people who receive an injection of PRP compared to a
      group of people who receive an injection of whole blood, a group treated with dry needle
      tendon fenestration and a group of people who receive no injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet rich plasma (PRP) deserves study because it is more expensive than the other
      treatments. If we learn that PRP is better compared to the other treatments, it would
      justify the high cost and growing industry associated with the procedure. If we find out
      that PRP is not better compared to the other treatments, there is the potential to save the
      health care system millions of dollars.

      We hope to show that we can recruit eligible participants and and complete the treatment and
      tests to answer the questions regarding the effectiveness of platelet rich plasma for
      patients with tennis elbow.

    <description>Local anesthetic (lidocaine)will be infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissue of the lateral elbow, after which a needle will then be placed into the tendon followed by 10-12 gentle strokes of dry needling in which the needle pierces the tendon at multiple sites. Whole blood will be drawn from the patient's unaffected arm using a butterfly needle. The blood will be centrifuged and then a dose of the platelet rich plasma will be placed into the common extensor tendon.</description>
