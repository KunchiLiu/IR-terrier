  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether a reduction in hormones (such as occurs during
      menopause) causes a decrease in calories burned during physical activity. This study will
      also determine whether a reduction in hormones decreases calories burned while sleeping,
      resting, and eating and whether an exercise intervention can prevent this.

      Participants will be women who are nearing menopause based on age (42-52 y) but have normal
      menstrual cycles. Participants will be randomized to receive monthly injections of placebo
      or a study drug that reduces sex hormones (GnRH agonist) for 24 weeks. Women who receive
      GnRH agonist will be further randomized to no exercise or a supervised exercise program.
      Thus, the 3 treatment groups are: placebo, GnRH agonist, GnRH agonist+exercise. The
      investigators will measure changes in calories burned during physical activity, sleep, rest,
      and after a meal after 3 and 6 months of hormone suppression using doubly-labeled water and
      room calorimetry. Other measures include food intake estimated from food records; body
      composition measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); glucose and insulin
      responses to an oral glucose tolerance test; and markers of inflammation in the blood.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Volunteers will be healthy women aged 40 to 60 years who are still
        experiencing regular menstrual cycles. They must be willing to be randomized to placebo or
        GnRHAG therapy for 24 weeks and physically able to be randomized to participate in a
        programmed exercise training program. We will consent up to 132 subjects with the aim of
        enrolling 22 in each of the 3 groups (placebo, GnRHAG, or GnRHAG+Exercise).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  irregular menstrual cycles defined as 2 or more missed cycles in the previous year

          -  serum FSH &gt;25 mIU/mL measured during the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle

          -  on hormonal contraceptive or menopausal therapy

          -  positive pregnancy test

          -  intention to become pregnant or start hormonal contraceptive therapy during the
             period of study

             re-evaluated, including after follow-up evaluation by the PCP with initiation or
             adjustment of anti-hypertensive medications
