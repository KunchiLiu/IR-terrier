    <textblock>
      This study is being done with people who are infected with HIV, but do not show any signs of
      having HIV. They are also feeling well without taking HIV medication and have low or
      undetectable levels of the virus in the blood. The purpose of this study is to see if taking
      HIV medication (antiretroviral therapy [ART]) will reduce immune activation (a signal that
      the body is fighting an infection) in people who have HIV, but do not show symptoms. Also
      this study will help determine how safe the drug is and how well people react to the drug.

      For this study, the following antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be provided in the form of a
      single tablet that contains three different drugs: emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF). These drugs are combined as one tablet which is approved
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a single pill to treat HIV infection. The HIV
      medication provided is one of the recommended treatments for HIV, including people with low
      viral loads (how much HIV you have in your body) who are taking HIV drugs for the first
      time. The risks seen with this HIV medication are the same that one would encounter when
      taking these drugs outside of the study.
