    <textblock>
      This is an European double-blind, placebo controlled parallel group comparison of DUODART
      (fixed dose combination of dutasteride 0.5mg and tamsulosin 0.4mg, one capsule daily) and
      placebo. Men eligible at screening will be randomised, after a 4 week placebo run-in, to the
      2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. All men will receive standardised lifestyle advice
      (primarily concerning weight management and exercise) relevant to maintaining sexual
      function. Men will also receive a standardised lifestyle advice leaflet for BPH. The double
      blind phase will continue for 12 months, with assessment visits at 2 weeks and at months 1,
      3, 6, 9 and a final visit at month 12. Subjects with sexual adverse events during the double
      blind phase will continue to be followed at scheduled study visits until resolution of the
      adverse event or at a visit 6 months after the last dose of study medication, whichever is
      sooner.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To assess the change in sexual function from baseline to 1 year in sexually active men with
      at least moderate BPH (international prostate symptom score - IPSS = or &gt; 12) who are
      treated with DUODART, compared to men treated with placebo . Change in sexual function will
      be assessed by change in total score from the full men's sexual health questionnaire (MSHQ)
      which has domains for erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory function and libido.

    <measure>Changes from Baseline (BL) in total score from the full Men's Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ) at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total MSHQ score is composed of 3 domain scores: Erection score(ES)=sum of score for Questions (Q) 1 to 3(ranges from 0 to 15), Ejaculation score(EjS)=sum of scores for Q5 to 11(ranges from 1 to 35), Satisfaction score(SS)=sum of scores for Q13 to 18(ranges from 6 to 30). Total MSHQ score=ES+EjS+SS. The total MSHQ score ranges from 7-80, with higher scores indicating greater sexual function. Change from BL at scheduled post-BL time points were analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis method with an Observed Cases approach. Values are expressed as adjusted mean along with standard error. The MMRM analysis included fixed categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction and the continuous fixed covariates of BL total score and BL score by visit interaction. BL is defined as earliest double-blind (DB) treatment start date if the par. took at least one dose of DB study drug; change from BL was calculated as Month 12 value(s) minus BL value(s)</description>
