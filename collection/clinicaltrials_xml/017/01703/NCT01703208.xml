  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cardiovascular (CV) safety profile of
      omarigliptin in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The primary hypothesis is
      that treatment with omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly is non-inferior to treatment with placebo
      and active comparators across the omarigliptin program with regard to the risk of developing
      a confirmed event in the primary CV composite endpoint.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial was amended to extend the length of the trial in order to meet FDA requirements
      for the post-approval assessment of cardiovascular (CV) safety. The trial now contains 2
      time intervals: Period 1 and Period 2. Period 1 refers to the time interval up to this
      recent protocol amendment and Period 2, the time interval from this protocol amendment until
      the end of the study. Participants in Period 1 will be re-consented and continue into Period
      2. If required, additional participants will be enrolled in Period 2. Stage 1 refers to the
      prefiling United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) requirement to rule out a 80%
      increased CV risk. Stage 2 refers to the US FDA post-marketing requirement to rule out a 30%
      increased CV risk. The Stage 1 assessment of CV risk occurred during Period 1 and was based
      on a meta-analysis of major adverse CV events (MACE) and unstable angina across the
      omarigliptin Phase 2/Phase 3 program. The Stage 2 assessment will be based on MACE in P018
      alone including CV events from both Period 1 and Period 2.
