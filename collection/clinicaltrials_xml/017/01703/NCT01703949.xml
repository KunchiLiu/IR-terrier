      This pilot clinical trial studies brentuximab vedotin in treating patients with CD30+
      lymphoma has come base after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment.
      Biological therapies, such as brentuximab vedotin, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rate following weekly brentuximab vedotin (1.2 mg/kg 3 of 4
      weeks for up to four 28-day cycles) in patients with lack of response (&lt; partial response
      [PR]) or progression following brentuximab vedotin and demonstrating persistent expression
      of CD30.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To monitor clinical outcome following the study treatment regimen.

      II. To estimate the frequency of CD30 loss in patients following resistance to brentuximab
      vedotin.

      III. To describe the pattern of CD30 expression (membranous, cytoplasmic, Golgi) in
      comparison to the pre-brentuximab vedotin expression.

      IV. To semi-quantitatively estimate and compare the surface density of CD30 pre and post
      brentuximab vedotin as measured by flow cytometry.

      V. To correlate response with CD30 density as measured by flow cytometry.

      VI. To evaluate the tolerability of the weekly regimen in patients previously exposed to
      brentuximab vedotin.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-5 weeks, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4 years.
