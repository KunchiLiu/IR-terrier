  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for cocaine dependence is characterized by high rates of relapse, yet the factors
      influencing the likelihood of relapse are poorly understood. Exposure to cocaine, stress and
      cocaine-related cues increase cocaine craving, and genetic polymorphisms in the dopamine D4
      receptor subtype (DRD4) influence the effects of cues and drug exposure on ratings of
      craving. However, craving does not robustly predict drug use or relapse. There are currently
      no data characterizing the interaction between DRD4 polymorphisms, cues and cocaine exposure
      on actual cocaine taking, i.e., cocaine self-administration. Incorporating measures of
      relapse into our established laboratory model is an important objective for medications
      development because models of cocaine self-administration have predictive validity in
      screening medications for cocaine dependence. Aim 1: Refine our cocaine self-administration
      procedures to include measures of relapse. The model is guided by hypotheses supported by
      pilot data: The likelihood of relapse and the quantity of cocaine self-administered
      following relapse will vary as a function of (1) the cost of cocaine, (2) the presence of
      contextual cues associated with cocaine-taking, and (3) noncontingent cocaine administration
      (i.e., 'priming'). Aim 2: Determine the influence of DRD4 polymorphisms on cue- and
      cocaine-induced relapse. Data with alcohol have demonstrated that individuals heterozygous
      or homozygous for 7 or more allele repeats (DRD4L) show increased cue- and alcohol-induced
      craving and greater relapse clinically than those with fewer than 7 allele repeats (DRD4 S).
      We hypothesize that cocaine-dependent DRD4 L volunteers will show greater cue- and
      prime-induced relapse compared to the DRD4 S group. Aim 3: Test the effects of modafinil on
      measures of cocaine relapse as a function of DRD4 polymorphisms. We hypothesize that
      modafinil will: (1) decrease the effect of both cues and a cocaine prime on the likelihood
      of relapse compared to placebo, (2) decrease the amount of cocaine self-administered if
      cocaine use is initiated, and (3) be more effective decreasing cue-and cocaine-induced
      relapse in the DRD4 L group than the DRD4 S group.

      This study will provide valuable information about the interaction between genetic
      variability, modafinil and environmental factors believed to increase cocaine relapse.
