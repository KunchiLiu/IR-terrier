  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of people with schizophrenia are characterized by impaired ability
      to socially engage with others, which may reflect social aversion secondary to defeatist
      beliefs; decreased motivation for social interactions; and/or impairment in the normal
      reinforcement value of social interactions. These impairments in social function have been
      shown to be associated with social skill deficits; and decreased ability to identify and
      remember emotional facial expressions and empathize with the emotional status of others.
      Unfortunately, pharmacological interventions have limited benefits for impaired social
      function, whereas psychosocial interventions provide only partial benefit for this critical
      aspect of the illness. The development of an effective intervention for functional outcomes
      remains a central therapeutic challenge. Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST)
      uses corrective feedback and reinforcement provided by successful interactions to challenge
      and reduce defeatist performance beliefs that contribute to low drive and interfere with
      social functioning. CBSST has been shown to have modest effects on social function in people
      with schizophrenia. Oxytocin plays a critical role in the regulation of normal social
      affiliative behavior; it is hypothesized to enhance social affiliation through the reduction
      of anxiety or social risk aversion; the enhancement of motivation for prosocial approach
      behavior; and/or increased modulation of the salience and processing of social cues. People
      with schizophrenia have decreased oxytocin levels, which are associated with an impaired
      ability to identify facial emotions and decreased prosocial behaviors. The study will be
      comprised of three phases: 1) 2-week Evaluation Phase; 2) 24-week Double-blind Treatment
      Phase; and 3) 3-month Follow-up Phase.

      A NIMH mission priority is the development of new and better interventions, whose focus
      extends beyond symptom amelioration to the development of interventions that allow people
      who suffer from severe mental illnesses &quot;to live full and productive lives&quot; (NIMH Strategic
      Plan, 2008). In particular, the NIMH Strategic Plan notes the importance of translating
      &quot;research on the biological causes of disorder to inform and develop psychosocial and
      biomedical interventions that target core features of disease, assess outcomes appropriate
      to the course of illness under study, and develop study designs that have impact on these
      features.&quot; The current proposal is built upon the observations that: 1) people with
      schizophrenia are characterized by marked impairments in their social function; 2) current
      pharmacological treatments do not address these impairments; 3) CBSST has been shown to have
      modest effects on social function in people with schizophrenia. This limited efficacy may be
      related to the lack of interest or drive people with schizophrenia have for social
      interactions; 4) oxytocin plays a critical role in normal social affiliative behavior
      through a) the reduction of anxiety or social risk aversion, b) the enhancement of
      motivation for prosocial approach or affiliative behavior, and/or c) increased modulation of
      the salience and processing of social cues; and 5) decreased oxytocin is associated with
      social function impairments in people with schizophrenia.

      The proposed study is based on the proposition that the use of a pharmacological agent,
      whose behavioral effects compliment the psychological mechanisms of action of a psychosocial
      intervention, is an important adaptation of an intervention previously shown to have
      moderate effects on social function. The addition of oxytocin to CBSST is hypothesized to:
      1) enhance the reduction of defeatist performance beliefs by reducing social risk
      aversiveness and avoidance, which would increase exposure to reinforcement and corrective
      feedback; 2) enhance social skill acquisition through improvement of proximal social
      behaviors, e.g. making eye contact and attending to the facial expressions of social
      partners; and 3) facilitate the translation of learned social skills into community practice
      through its effects on prosocial attachment behaviors, reduction in social disinterest, and
      effects on distal behaviors, e.g. initiating conversations and responding to social
      invitations. Increased social risk taking within and between sessions would expose
      participants to a greater frequency of positive feedback and success experiences, which
      would provide evidence to dispute their defeatist beliefs and social disinterest attitudes.
      In addition, increased social risk taking could improve homework adherence (e.g., practicing
      talking to people in the community) and engagement in new community activities. These
      interactive effects would subsequently lead to a substantial improvement in CBSST efficacy
      for social function. Ultimately, the importance of improved social function is the effect
      that such improvement would have on overall levels of health and functioning, including
      vocational outcome.

      The proposed study will enable us to collect preliminary data on the acceptability,
      efficacy, feasibility, and safety of the proposed intervention. In particular, this would be
      the first study to examine the safety of long-term oxytocin in this population. The study
      will also provide critical data on the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants
      with schizophrenia in a long-term intervention, which combines two different therapeutic
      modalities: CBSST and oxytocin. If found to be efficacious, feasible, and well-tolerated, we
      will plan to conduct a larger study, which would include the use of cognitive and imaging
      biomarkers, to more fully elucidate the mechanism of action of the observed treatment
      effects. The investigators will address the following specific aims:

      Aim #1 (Efficacy): To determine if CBSST + oxytocin compared to CBSST + placebo-oxytocin is
      associated with improved social function.

      Aim #2 (Safety): To determine if CBSST + oxytocin compared to CBSST + placebo-oxytocin is
      associated with increased incidence of side effects.

      Aim #3 (Change Mechanism): To determine if CBSST + oxytocin compared to CBSST +
      placebo-oxytocin is associated with reduced social aversion, including social disinterest
      and defeatist performance beliefs; increased ability to trust others; and/or improved
      performance on facial recognition and memory measures.

      Aim #4 (Other Outcomes): To determine if CBSST + oxytocin compared to CBSST +
      placebo-oxytocin is associated with improved neuropsychological test performance, and/or
      decreased positive, negative, and/or anxiety/depression symptoms, and clinical global
      improvement.
