  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the drug NULOJIX® (belatacept) will minimize the
      amount of other anti-rejection medications necessary and thereby reduce the long-term side
      effects caused by the other medications. The researchers also want to learn more about the
      safety of this treatment and long term health of transplanted pancreases and kidneys.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune
      systems (the body's natural defense system against illness) from rejecting their new organs.
      Most patients who receive a transplanted organ must take these anti-rejection medications
      for the rest of their lives, or for as long as the transplanted organ continues to work.
      Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects,
      including pancreas and kidney damage. There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection
      medications that work just as well, but could lessen the amount of anti-rejection
      medications that are taken long term.
