  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol, UMCC 2012.047, was a pilot study initially intended for 12 subjects. After
      completing enrollment of the planned 12 subjects, we are extending the study to an
      additional 25 subjects. The trial will examine the safety and efficacy of the addition of
      vorinostat, the study drug, to standard medications to try to prevent or lower the risk of
      graft versus-host disease (GVHD) for recipients of unrelated (matched) donor, blood or
      marrow stem cell transplants. The transplant regimens, chosen according to current
      institutional policy, will depend upon the recipient's underlying disease (their blood
      cancer or other blood disorder), previous therapy, and current health issues. GVHD
      prophylaxis (preventive drug intervention) will be the local institutional standard for
      post-transplant immunosuppression, including tacrolimus and methotrexate, plus vorinostat.
      Vorinostat will be given twice daily orally beginning 10 days prior to the recipient's
      transplant and continue for up to 100 days after transplant.

      This trial is investigating the use of vorinostat (Merck) for standard graft versus-host
      disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT). A major limitation of the increased utilization of allogeneic HCT
      (Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation) is the inferior outcomes when donors other than HLA
      (HumanLeukocyte Antigen)-matched siblings are used 1,2. Compared to matched related donors,
      recipients of matched unrelated donor transplants are at a significantly increased risk of
      death and transplant-related mortality (TRM) 3,4. Acute GVHD remains a significant
      contributor to TRM, which develops in approximately 50-70% of recipients receiving these
      type of grafts despite standard immunosuppressive prophylaxis 5-8. Thus, novel GVHD
      prophylaxis strategies which successfully attenuate acute GVHD-related complications without
      increasing other causes of TRM or relapse are needed.

      The historical experience of day 100 grade 2-4 acute GVHD in 154 comparable patients treated
      at the University of Michigan (2005 - 2011) receiving standard GVHD prophylaxis after
      unrelated donor allogeneic transplant is 48%. At Washington University, the cumulative
      incidence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD in patients following unrelated donor transplant is 62%.

      Research data collectively suggests, that reducing lethal acute GVHD should improve
      long-term survival for patients undergoing unrelated donor transplant.
