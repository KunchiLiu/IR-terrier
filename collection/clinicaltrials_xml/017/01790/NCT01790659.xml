  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pivotal Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 3-site, two-group trial assessing
      the efficacy and safety of WR 279,396 Topical Cream and Paromomycin Alone Topical Cream in
      subjects with CL in Panama. The primary objective of this study is to determine if WR
      279,396 results in statistically superior final clinical cure rates of an index lesion when
      compared with Paromomycin Alone for the treatment of CL in Panama expected to be caused by L
      panamensis.

      Subjects will be recruited from three regions in Panama known to be endemic for L panamensis
      CL. Subjects will be screened over a period up to 28 days for eligibility including medical
      history, physical examination, leishmaniasis history, vital signs, clinical chemistry, prior
      medications, and parasitology for confirmation of ulcerative CL. If eligible, subjects will
      be randomized in a targeted 1:1 ratio (200 subjects per group) using site as a
      stratification variable to receive either WR 279,396 (15% paromomycin + 0.5% gentamicin
      topical cream) or Paromomycin Alone (15% paromomycin topical cream) by topical application
      to CL lesions once daily for 20 days. Efficacy will be assessed by measuring the size of the
      index lesion ulcer, non-index lesions ulcers, and overall size of other non-ulcerated
      lesions at baseline (before the start of treatment), and on Study Days 20, 35 ± 2 days, 49 ±
      4 days, 63 ± 7 days, 100 ± 14 days, and 168 ± 14 days. A notation will be made if clinical
      evidence of parasite persistence is observed at the Day 63 and beyond visits including
      significant erythema and induration when a lesion has otherwise completely re-epithelialized
      to document any subjects removed from the study early if the investigator judges them to be
      in need of rescue treatment. A photograph will be taken of all lesions at baseline, Day 20
      and each of the follow-up visits. Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs)
      from the start of treatment until study completion, lesion site reactions during treatment,
      physical examination of the nasal and oral mucosa for appearance of mucosal leishmaniasis on
      Days 63 ± 7 days, 100 ± 14 days, and 168 ± 14 days, concomitant medication use for the
      duration of the study, blood creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST) levels on Study Day 20. After the sponsor's approval, biochemistry
      can be repeated in the case of abnormal results and if the causes of these results could not
      be determined. A repeat pregnancy test on Day 35. Recent infection with leishmaniasis prior
      to the start of the study may result in the development of lesions that were not present at
      the start of the study that did not receive treatment. New lesions may be treated at the
      discretion of the investigator with the topical cream to which the subject was assigned any
      time during the conduct of the study except that treatment must be completed by the Day 168
      visit. If a new lesion is discovered at the final study visit, the subject will be referred
      to their primary physician for treatment.

      Subjects who fail therapy (see definition of failure below) will be taken off study and may
      be administered rescue therapy at the discretion of the subject's personal physician. If the
      subject met the criteria for therapy failure but was undergoing treatment for new lesions,
      the subject can continue in the study (by signing a consent addendum) if the investigator
      decides it is in the best interest of the subject to do so.
