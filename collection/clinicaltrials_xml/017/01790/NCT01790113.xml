      A Prospective, Randomized, Multicenter Study comparing the Safety and Effectiveness of
      Arthrex's Eclipse™ Shoulder to the Univers™ II Shoulder Prosthesis in patients with a
      degenerative joint disease.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Arthrex Eclipse™ Shoulder
      Prosthesis to the Arthrex Univers™ II Shoulder Prosthesis for the treatment of degenerative
      joint disease in subjects who are candidates for total shoulder replacement. Non-inferiority
      in terms of safety and effectiveness will be measured by a 2 year composite clinical success
      (CCS) that requires functional improvement, radiographic success, absence of reoperations
      and revision, and lack of serious device-related adverse events.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is &gt; 21 years of age

          -  The subject has continued symptoms in target shoulder despite at least 3 months of
             other treatment modalities(e.g.: anti-inflammatory, physical therapy and steroid
             injections)

          -  The subject has a diagnosis in the target shoulder of one or more of the following:

        osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, post-traumatic arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis.

          -  The subject presents with pain and functional impairment in the index shoulder,
             measured by an Adjusted Constant Score of ≤50. Note: The Adjusted Constant Score will
             be calculated from the raw Constant Score to establish patient eligibility.

          -  The subject is willing to receive implantation of the Arthrex™ Shoulder Prosthesis or
             Univers™ II Shoulder Prosthesis.

          -  The subject must be physically and mentally willing and able to comply with all study
             procedures (including follow-up visits and radiographic assessments) until the
             conclusion of the study.

          -  The subject has been informed of the nature of the study and provided written consent

             humeral head of the target shoulder, as demonstrated by radiographic evaluation.

          -  The subject has a target shoulder a rotator cuff that is not intact and not
             reconstructible.
