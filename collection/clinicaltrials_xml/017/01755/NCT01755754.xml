      A multi-center, open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover non-inferiority trial to
      assess the functionality of female condoms with a silicone elastomer vaginal ring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, randomized, 2-period, crossover non-inferiority trial, conducted
      over 4.5 months at two research centers in the USA among 81 healthy, monogamous,
      heterosexual, sexually active couples to assess the functionality of female lubricated,
      nitrile condoms during vaginal intercourse in the presence and absence of a silicone
      elastomer placebo vaginal ring.

             visit;

          3. Healthy on the basis of medical history;

          4. Not at risk of pregnancy, i.e., female is surgically sterile, using an IUD, or using

          5. Sexually active and agree to have at least 8 acts of penile-vaginal intercourse using
             a study condom over 2 periods of up to 4 weeks each;

          6. Agree to use only the female condoms provided by trial personnel during the time of
             participation and not to use male condoms during the trial. Additional lubricant will
             be provided; use of non-study lubricants will not be allowed;

          7. Agree to not use genital jewelry or other vaginal products, except menstrual
             absorption products (e.g., tampons) and study lubricant during the trial;

          8. Available for all visits and consent to follow all procedures scheduled for the
             trial;

          9. At low risk for HIV infection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Males with untreated erectile dysfunction;

          2. Female with positive pregnancy test;

          3. Either partner allergic or hypersensitive to vaginal lubricants such as Astorlige ®

          4. Either partner not willing to refrain from wearing genital piercing jewelry for the
             duration of the study

          5. History by self-report of recurrent or a recently-treated (within past 2 weeks)
             sexually transmitted infection (e.g. gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia) or HIV(+);

          6. Consistently using male or female condoms for protection against sexually transmitted
             infection;

          7. Either partner taking any topical or oral medication to treat a urogenital condition
             at enrollment, except medication for the male partner to treat erectile dysfunction
             (e.g., tadalafil, sildenafil);

          8. Either partner with a self-reported or clinically diagnosed urogenital condition
             (e.g. itching, burning, irritation, etc.) that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             could affect use of the study condoms or ability to interpret trial data;

          9. Females, based on findings from a pelvic examination, who are not suitable candidates
             for wearing the vaginal ring (anatomical condition, current vaginal infection, etc.)

         10. Current participation in a study or other research involving a drug, device or other
             product;

         11. Any condition(s) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with
             adherence to trial requirements or evaluation of the trial objectives.
