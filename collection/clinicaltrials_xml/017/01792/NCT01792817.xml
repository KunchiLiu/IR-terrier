    <textblock>
      Multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled pivotal study of
      non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation with the GammaCore® device for the acute treatment of
      cluster headache. The study compares the safety and effectiveness of an active treatment
      (GammaCore) against a sham treatment.

      Phase 1: Prospective, randomized (1:1 active treatment:sham control allocation), double
      blinded, sham controlled treatment (active or sham) phase

      Phase 2: Prospective, non-randomized, active treatment phase.

      Phase 1 - Two Arms:

        1. Active Treatment with the GammaCore Device

        2. Sham Treatment with a placebo device
