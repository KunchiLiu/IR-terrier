      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of decitabine followed by
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, and cytarabine and to see how well they work in
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome that has
      returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, cytarabine, and decitabine,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug
      (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of decitabine priming followed by sequential
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride/etoposide/cytarabine (MEC) chemotherapy in adults with
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine, within the limits of a Phase 1/2 study, disease response and duration of
      remission.

      II. Identify biomarkers (e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] methylation and/or gene
      expression changes) associated with treatment responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of decitabine followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) on days -9 to -5 (dose level 1), days -11 to
      -5 (dose level 2), or days -14 to -5 (dose level 3).

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV on days 1-5, etoposide IV
      on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV on days 1-5. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or CR
      with incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp) may receive up to 2 courses of induction
      therapy and up to 2 courses of consolidation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5
      years.

             radiographical suspicion of cardiac dysfunction, or if the previous cardiac
             assessment was abnormal

          -  Concomitant illness associated with a likely survival of &lt; 1 year

          -  Active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection, unless disease is under
             treatment with anti-microbials and/or controlled or stable (e.g. if specific,
             effective therapy is not available/feasible or desired [e.g. chronic viral hepatitis,
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]); patient needs to be clinically stable as
             defined as being afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 24 hours; patients with
