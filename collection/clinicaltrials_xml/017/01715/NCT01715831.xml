    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, single-arm extension study will evaluate the long-term safety
      of tocilizumab (RoActemra/Actemra) in participants with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).
      Participants who have completed the MA21488 (NCT00810199) core study and the ML21530
      (NCT00754572) study and who could benefit from the study drug, according to the opinion of
      the investigator, will receive 8 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) of intravenous (IV)
      tocilizumab every 4 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks.
