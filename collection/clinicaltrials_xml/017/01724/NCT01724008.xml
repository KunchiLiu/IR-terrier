        Inclusion

          -  Demonstrates understanding of the study and willingness to participate

          -  Aged at least 18 to 65 years

          -  Understands and is willing, able and likely to comply with all study procedures and
             restrictions

          -  Good general health with (in the opinion of the investigator) no clinically
             significant and relevant abnormalities of medical history or oral examination.

          -  Self-reported history of dentinal hypersensitivity lasting more than 6 months but not
             more than 10 years

          -  Minimum of 20 natural teeth at screening, a minimum of two accessible teeth
             (incisors, canines, pre-molars)

          -  At baseline, participant has two non-adjacent sensitive teeth from those meeting the
             EAR, GI and mobility criteria at screening, with sensitivity measured by tactile
             stimulus (Yeaple ≤ 20g) and evaporative (air) assessment (Schiff Sensitivity Score ≥
             2) at baseline

        Exclusion

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely
             related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients.

          -  Participation in another clinical study or receipt of an investigational drug within
             30 days of the screening visit

          -  Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse

          -  An employee of the sponsor or the study site or members of their immediate family

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, causes xerostomia

          -  Dental prophylaxis within 4 weeks of screening

          -  Tongue or lip piercing or presence of dental implants

          -  Professional desensitising treatment within 12 weeks of screening

          -  Gross periodontal disease, treatment of periodontal disease (including surgery)
             within 12 months of screening, scaling or root planning within 3 months of screening.

          -  Teeth bleaching within 12 weeks of screening

          -  Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay in 12
             months of screening

          -  Tooth with exposed dentine but with deep, defective or facial restorations, teeth
             used as abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures, teeth with full crowns or
             veneers, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel. Sensitive teeth with contributing

          -  Sensitive tooth not expected to respond to treatment with an over-the counter
             dentifrice in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Use of a desensitising dentifrice within six weeks of screening (participant will be
             required to bring their current dentifrice to the site in order to verify the lack of
             known anti-sensitivity ingredients)

          -  Daily doses of a medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             interfere with the perception of pain

          -  Currently taking antibiotics or have taken antibiotics within 2 weeks of baseline.

          -  Daily doses of a medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, causes
             xerostomia

          -  Individuals who require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures

          -  Any participant who, in the judgment of the investigator, should not participate in
