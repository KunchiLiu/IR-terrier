  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, two-part study is designed to assess the safety, PK, PD, and therapeutic
      activity of RO7009789 in combination with vanucizumab in participants with metastatic solid
      tumors not amenable to standard treatment. Part I (dose escalation) is designed to establish
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RO7009789 in this combination. Part II (expansion) is
      intended to further characterize the safety and clinical activity profile of RO7009789 among
      indication-specific cohorts.
