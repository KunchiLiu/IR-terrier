      The ex-vivo lung will be evaluated by XLTF-UC180 for localization of the tumor. The
      ultrasound probe will be put on the lung surface in several different directions to obtain
      the cross section with maximum diameter. The ultrasound image with size measurement of the
      tumor will be recorded using an ultrasound scanner (EU-Y0008, OLYMPUS MEDICALSYSTEMS CORP.,
      Tokyo, Japan). Next, the bronchial stump of the specimen will be opened and a small sized
      endotracheal tube will be inserted to inflate and deflate the lung. After inflation of the
      lung, the tumor will be evaluated by XLTF-UC180 to see the difference in ultrasound images
      between deflated and inflated lung. After ultrasound evaluation, the specimen will be
      delivered directly to the pathology laboratory and the actual tumor size and histological
      diagnosis will be determined. In addition, we will evaluate the differences between US image
      and pathological morphology using HE slides of lung tumor. We will work together with the
      surgical team to confirm sign off of specimens.

      This is a single center clinical trial. Forty patients (sufficient for an initial
      evaluation) scheduled for a lobectomy or an anatomical segmental resection for malignant
      lung tumors will be enrolled in the study. After lung resection, the lung will be placed on
      a surgical table in a similar position to the in-vivo situation in the Image Guided
      Therapeutic operating room (GTx-OR) within Toronto General Hospital. The lung will be
      evaluated by XLTF-UC180 for localization of the tumor. The ultrasound probe will be put on
      the lung surface in several different directions to obtain the cross section with maximum
      diameter. The ultrasound image with size measurement of the tumor will be recorded using an
      ultrasound scanner (EU-Y0008, OLYMPUS MEDICALSYSTEMS CORP., Tokyo, Japan). Next, the
      bronchial stump of the specimen will be opened and a small sized endotracheal tube will be
      inserted to inflate and deflate the lung. After inflation of the lung, the tumor will be
      evaluated by XLTF-UC180 to see the difference in ultrasound images between deflated and
      inflated lung. After ultrasound evaluation, the specimen will be delivered directory to the
      pathology laboratory and the actual tumor size and histological diagnosis will be
      determined. In addition, we will evaluate the differences between US image and pathological
      morphology using Hemotoxylin and Eosin (HE) slides of lung tumor. We will work together with
      the surgical team to confirm sign off of specimens.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of thoracoscopic ultrasound for localization of pulmonary nodules in ex-vivo human lungs. We will evaluate the resected specimen using the XLTF-UC180 in the GTx-OR to determine the localization rate of the targets. Ultrasound measurement and images will be compared to the actual size of the tumor and pathological morphology using HE slides of lung tumor to determine the correlation between those variables. The tumor depth from the lung surface will be also collected to clarify the maximum depth to which the ultrasound can visualize</description>
