  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this single center, randomized, open label study in relapsing
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients on PLEGRIDY (peginterferon beta-1a) is to assess the effect
      of Preparation H (phenylephrine) Maximum Strength Cream compared to no topical treatment of
      injection site erythema after PLEGRIDY injection.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    It was decided on 9/21/2016 to terminate this study early because LogPad devices the patients
    used to record their injection data was flawed
