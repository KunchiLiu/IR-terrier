      This study evaluates the short and long term effect of dental cleaning and mouthrinsing for
      the treatment of bad breath

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of bad breath producing bacteria can be found in pockets around the gums and
      the top of the tongue. It is generally agreed that one of the most effective means of
      controlling the production of bad breath gases from these bacteria is their mechanical
      removal. Tongue cleaning has shown consistent results in the reduction of bad breath, while
      dental cleaning has shown positive, but less conclusive results. The addition of a mouth
      rinse to mechanical measures has shown medium-term effectiveness, however there is currently
      no information available that describes the long-term impact of mechanical and chemical
      measures for the treatment of bad breath and the appropriate interval for follow-up and
      on-going management to prevent difficult cases.
