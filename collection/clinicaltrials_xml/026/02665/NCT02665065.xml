      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Iomab-B, in
      conjunction with a Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) regimen and protocol-specified
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT), versus Conventional Care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have active, relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Active, relapsed or
             refractory AML is defined as either (1) primary induction failure (PIF) after 2 or
             more cycles of chemotherapy, (2 first early relapse after a remission duration of
             fewer than 6 months, (3) relapse refractory to salvage combination chemotherapy
             containing high-dose AraC, and (4) second or subsequent relapse

          -  Have documented CD45 expression by leukemic cells via flow cytometry (a &quot;blast gate&quot;
             on CD45 vs. side scatter analysis consistent with AML)

          -  Be at least 55 years of age

          -  Have a circulating blast count of less than 10,000/mm3 (control with hydroxyurea is
             allowed)

          -  Have a calculated creatinine clearance (Cockroft-Gault equation) &gt; 50 mL/min

          -  Have adequate hepatic function (bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT), defined as ≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal [ULN])

          -  Have a Karnofsky score ≥ 70

          -  Have an expected survival of &gt; 60 days

          -  Have a central venous catheter line in place prior to study treatment administration

          -  Have 8/8 allele-level, related or unrelated, HSC donor matching at human leukocyte
             antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and DRB-1

          -  For women of childbearing potential, be surgically sterile or agree to practice
             abstinence or utilize acceptable contraception (intrauterine, injectable,
             transdermal, or combination oral contraceptive) through 1-year post transplant; For
             males who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential must be surgically
             sterile or using an acceptable method of contraception (defined as barrier methods in
             conjunction with spermicides) from time of screening through 12 weeks after last dose
             of study drug

          -  Be able to understand the study procedures, agree to participate in the study
             program, and voluntarily provide written Informed Consent

          -  Have active leukemic central nervous system (CNS) involvement, as defined by any
             leukemic blasts detected in the CSF by morphology or flow cytometry and/or any
             chloromas detected by CNS imaging

          -  Have previously received HCT

          -  Have clinically significant cardiac disease (NYHA Class III or IV); clinically
             significant arrhythmia i.e. ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or
             &quot;Torsade de Pointes&quot;. Myocardial infarction with uncontrolled angina within 6 months,
             congestive heart failure, or clinical significant cardiomyopathy

          -  Have abnormal QTcF (&gt;450milliseconds) after electrolytes have been corrected (at
             least two different ECG readings and at least 15 minutes between readings)

          -  Have known prior positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
             hepatitis B (HBV) or C. Subjects who have positive HBV test results due to having
             been previously vaccinated against hepatitis B, as evidenced by negative hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg), negative anti- hepatitis B core protein (HBc) and positive
             antibody to the HBsAg (anti-HBs) are not excluded

          -  Have active serious infection uncontrolled by antibiotics or antifungals

          -  Have acute promyelocytic leukemia and the associated cytogenic translocation
             t:(15/17)

          -  Have active malignancy within 2 years of entry. Exceptions to this exclusion include:
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia, and successfully treated organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence
             of progressive disease based on prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and are not on
             active therapy

          -  Have received a biologic therapy within 3 weeks
