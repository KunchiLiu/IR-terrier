  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This six months non-interventional, observational, post-marketing, multi-center and local
      study will evaluate the differences in the use of corticosteroids between RA participants
      receiving TCZ or a TNF-inhibitor, in participants who have discontinued the use of a
      TNF-inhibitor as their first biological treatment.

             the data concerning him/her being subject to computerized data processing, have given
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had more than one TNF-inhibitor prior to the enrolment visit.

          -  Have had biological treatment other than TNF-inhibitors.

          -  Participants that are continuously treated with per oral corticosteroids for any
             other indication than RA (at baseline).
