    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two treatment, parallel group study to
      investigate the effects of RG7625, a cathepsin S inhibitor, on the immune response to a
      gluten challenge in volunteers with celiac disease. Volunteers with previously diagnosed
      celiac disease will be randomized to receive either 100 milligrams (mg) RG7625 or placebo
      twice daily with food for 28 days (Days 1 to 28).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers with a biopsy confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease

          -  Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) serotype DQ 2.5 and HLA-DQ 8 haplotypes

          -  Maintaining a gluten-free diet for at least one year. Compliance will be assessed by
             serology, compatible responses to a self-reported assessment of gluten-free diet
             adherence and the absence of typical celiac disease symptoms

          -  Able to participate and to comply with the study restrictions including the
             requirements of the gluten challenge

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity

          -  A personal history of food intolerance other than to gluten, or diagnosis of
             galactosemia, lactose, galactose or fructose intolerance

          -  A personal history of severe acute symptomatic reaction to sporadic gluten ingestion

          -  A diagnosis of refractory celiac disease or presence of severe complications of
             celiac disease

          -  Diagnosed or suspected immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency

          -  Acute inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease),
             gastrointestinal obstruction or sub-occlusive syndromes, digestive perforation or
             risk of digestive perforation, painful abdominal syndromes of undetermined cause

          -  A history of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection. Appendectomy and hernia
             repair are acceptable

          -  Any confirmed significant allergic reactions (urticaria or anaphylaxis) against any
             drug, or multiple allergies (non-active hay fever is acceptable)

          -  Immunocompromised or with reduced immune function considered to be clinically
             significant by the Investigator

          -  Immunization within 30 days before the screening visit or planning vaccination during
             the study

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating, or who are of child-bearing potential and do not
             agree to comply with requirements for contraceptive use. Men who do not agree to
             comply with requirements for contraceptive use and restrictions on sperm donation

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within the three months
             preceding the screening visit
