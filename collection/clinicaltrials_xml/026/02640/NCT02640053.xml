  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies topical cryotherapy (a procedure in which an
      extremely cold liquid is used to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue) in reducing pain in
      patients with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy or paclitaxel induced acute pain
      syndrome. Peripheral neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes pain, numbness, tingling,
      swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts of the body. Paclitaxel produces a disabling
      syndrome of acute aches and pains. Topical cryotherapy may help relieve pain from peripheral
      neuropathy or acute pain syndrome caused by chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate whether topical cryotherapy can alleviate paclitaxel-induced peripheral
      neuropathy.

      II. To estimate whether topical cryotherapy can alleviate paclitaxel-induced acute pain
      syndrome (P-APS).

      III. To examine the possible relative toxicities related to topical cryotherapy in this
      study situation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients apply bags filled with crushed ice to hands and feet for 15 minutes before,
      for 60 minutes during administration, and for 15 minutes after finishing administration of
      paclitaxel.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on weeks 1-12.

      In both arms, courses repeat once a week for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 6 months.
