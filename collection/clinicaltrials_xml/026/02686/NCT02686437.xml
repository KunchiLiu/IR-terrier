    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of standard tension of
      Thera-Band® Kinesiological Tape (TB-KT) application versus varied tension on shoulder pain,
      disability, and recovery speed during an in-office rehabilitative program. A convenience
      sample size of 38 new patients with current shoulder pain will be recruited for this study.
      The outcome measures will include the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and the Penn Shoulder
      Score (PENN). After completing the initial paperwork, patients will be randomized into two
      groups, control (0% tension) and intervention(increasing tension). At the beginning of each
      week the tape will be reapplied, and pain rating will be recorded. At the conclusion of 4
      weeks patients will complete the PENN.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of standard tension of
      Thera-Band® Kinesiological Tape (TB-KT) application versus varied tension on shoulder pain,
      disability, and recovery speed during an in-office rehabilitative program. A convenience
      sample size of 38 new patients with current shoulder pain will be recruited for this study.
      Patients must be tested within the first 2 to 3 therapy visits, have a diagnosis of shoulder
      pain, be 18-64 years old, no corticosteroid treatment within the last two weeks,
      post-surgical cases will be excluded, and patients may not be pregnant. Upon agreeing to the
      study, patients will sign an informed consent, complete a demographics questionnaire, and
      complete specific outcome measure assessments. The outcome measures will include the Numeric
      Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and the Penn Shoulder Score (PENN). After completing the initial
      paperwork, patients will be randomized into two groups, control and intervention. The
      Control group will receive standard FUNHAB® in-office care in addition to standard TB-KT
      taping technique. The Intervention group will receive standard FUNHAB® in-office care plus
      varying tension application of TB-KT. The TB-KT will be applied to the shoulder complex to
      influence proper activation of the rotator cuff muscles, specifically the supraspinatus and
      infraspinatus. The tape will be applied in an &quot;I&quot; strip from the vertebral border of the
      scapula to the lesser tubercle of the humerus. Over the course of the 4 weeks, the tension
      of the tape will systemically increase. At the beginning of each week the tape will be
      reapplied, and pain rating will be recorded. At the conclusion of 4 weeks patients will
      complete the PENN.

    <description>The kinesiology tape will be applied to the shoulder complex to influence proper activation of the rotator cuff muscles, specifically the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The clinician applied the tape in an &quot;I&quot; strip from the vertebral border of the scapula to the lesser tubercle of the humerus. Over the course of the 4 weeks of care, the tension of the Intervention Group's tape will systemically increase based on the following timelines:
Week 1: 0% tension Week 2: 25% tension Week 3: 50% tension Week 4: 75% tension</description>

    <description>The kinesiology tape will be applied to the shoulder complex to influence proper activation of the rotator cuff muscles, specifically the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The clinician applied the tape in an &quot;I&quot; strip from the vertebral border of the scapula to the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Over the course of the 4 weeks of care, the tension of the Control Group's tape will remain at 0% tension</description>

    <description>Kinesiology taping technique is designed to target muscles and lymphatic system. Limited research is available for specific conditions, including low back pain, but it is theorized to correct muscle function by inhibiting or facilitating the muscle, improve blood flow, reduce pain, and improve joint alignment.</description>
