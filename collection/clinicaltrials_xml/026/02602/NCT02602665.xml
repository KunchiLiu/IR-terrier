    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, controlled trial in which tunneled central line
      catheters will be placed in two distinct, select positions. The catheter tip position will
      then be followed up prospectively after placement to determine whether there is any
      malpositioning of the tip and if one placement is better than the other.

    <textblock>
      Optimal central line placement is vital to catheter longevity. If malpositioned, the
      catheter may need to get replaced, potentially causing additional morbidity to the patient
      and additional cost to the healthcare system. In our department, a retrospective study
      looking at catheter tip position at inital placement and incidence of malposition. In this
      study, 404 catheter placements were reviewed, and a total of 162 (40.1%) were replaced. Out
      of the 162 replaced, 36 (22.2%) were replaced secondary to malposition. From this study, we
      were also able to conclude that catheter tips placed in a deeper position, approximately one
      and a half vertebral bodies below the carina, were less likely to be malpositioned in the
      future upon radiographic review.

      Current standard of care does not dictate positioning of the line in a specific loacation.
      In the presence of these findings, we are proposing to conduct a single center randomized
      control trial in which tunneled central line catheters will be placed in two distinct,
      select positions. After informed consent is obtained from the patient and family, they will
      be randomized to one of two treatment groups. The shallow group will have the tip of the
      catheter located approximately one vertebral body above the carina. The deep group will have
      the catheter tip placed 1.5 to 2.5 vertebral bodies below the carina. Central line placement
      will be performed under fluoroscopy in the operating room to optimize catheter placement.
      Chest X ray in the post operative area will be used to confirm catheter tip position. The
      catheter tip position will then be followed up prospectively using chest X ray films at or
      within three months after placement to determine whether there is any malpositioning of the
      tip.

    <description>The primary outcome measure of this study is to determine whether the position of the tip during central line placement plays a role in malposition during further evaluation of these patients. This will be determined with chest X-ray done at or within 90 days after line insertion. All non-ultrasound guided lines and those placed by cut down procedure will be tallied in a prospective manner to calculate the number of lines placed without radiological guidance. Number of attempts required to place the line (number of times the needle is removed exterior to the skin, i.e. number of skin punctures.)</description>
