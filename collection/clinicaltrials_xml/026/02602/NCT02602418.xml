  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite potent combination antiretroviral therapy, cognitive (memory and concentration)
      problems continue to occur in up to 50% of HIV-infected individuals, especially in older
      infected individuals, and those who abuse alcohol, marijuana or psychostimulants. Since no
      effective treatments are available to these individuals with cognitive problems,
      conservative estimates indicate that the cost of care for these patients could double in the
      next two decades. To address this urgent problem, this study will use a comprehensive
      approach (cognitive tests, functional MRI and several biomarkers) to evaluate whether a
      novel computer-based training program would improve the brain function, especially working
      memory and attention, in HIV-infected and infected individuals.

      The Overall Goals are to perform a double blind placebo-controlled study using Cogmed™ to
      determine whether this adaptive WM training program will benefit HIV-infected individuals,
      and whether the investigators can identify individuals who might benefit most from the WM
      training. Lastly, the investigators will explore how brain activation, neuroinflammation and
      CSF monoamine levels might be related to WM function before and after the training.

    <description>Intervention; subjects will be trained using 12 different computerized visual and spatial Working Memory tasks. Each session will involve 8 of the 12 tasks, and each subject is required to complete 25 training sessions, 30-40 minutes per day, 4-5 days per week over a 5-8 week period (minimum 20 sessions). The tasks will become more difficult in an &quot;adaptive&quot; manner, which is hypothesized as optimal for learning and training effect.</description>

Adaptive working memory CogMedTM training: They will be trained using 12 different computerized visual and spatial Working Memory tasks. Each session will involve 8 of the 12 tasks, and each subject is required to complete 25 training sessions, 30-40 minutes per day, 4-5 days per week over a 5-8 week period (minimum 20 sessions). The tasks will become more difficult in an &quot;adaptive&quot; manner, which is hypothesized as optimal for learning and training effect.
