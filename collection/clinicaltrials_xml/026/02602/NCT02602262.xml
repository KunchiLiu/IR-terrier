  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals who agree to accept and receive a solid organ transplant
      from an HIV+ deceased donor will be followed to determine the safety and efficacy of this
      practice. Some HIV+ individuals who receive a solid organ transplant from HIV-uninfected
      donors will also be followed.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational study designed to evaluate safety and outcomes of solid organ
      transplantation in HIV+ recipients of HIV+ deceased donors. This study will evaluate overall
      survival and graft survival compared to transplantation with an HIV- organ.

      In addition the study will assess potential complications of organ transplant using HIV+
      deceased donors - including but not limited to - HIV superinfection, incidence and severity
      of graft rejection, recurrence of HIV-associated nephropathy, incidence of bacterial
      infections, and opportunistic infections.

        All individuals with end-stage organ disease and HIV infection who meet standard clinical
        criteria for transplantation and the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
        eligible for participation in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All individuals with end-stage organ disease and HIV infection who meet standard clinical
        criteria for transplantation and the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
        eligible for participation in the study.

          1. Participant is able to understand and provide informed consent

          2. Participant meets standard listing criteria for transplant.

          3. Documented HIV infection (by any licensed ELISA and confirmation by Western Blot,
             positive HIV Ab IFA, or documented history of detectable HIV-1 RNA).

          4. Participant is ≥ 18 years old.

          5. Opportunistic Complications: None or previous history of protocol allowed
             opportunistic infections or neoplasms with appropriate acute and maintenance therapy
             and no evidence of active disease.

          6. Participant CD4+ T-cell count is &gt;/= 200/µL in the 26 weeks prior to transplant.

          7. Participant most recent HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL (by any FDA-approved assay performed
             in CLIA-approved laboratory), in the 26 weeks prior to transplant. Non-consecutive
             viral &quot;blips&quot; between 50-400 copies RNA/mL will be allowed.

          8. Antiretroviral therapy: To avoid drug interactions, ritonavir or
             cobicistat-containing regimens are not recommended, unless in the opinion of the
             HIV/Transplant Infectious Disease team there is no alternative regimen expected to
             control HIV replication.

          9. Participant is willing to use PCP, herpes virus and fungal prophylaxis as indicated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant has concomitant conditions that, in the judgment of the investigators,
             would preclude transplantation or immunosuppression.

          2. Opportunistic Complication History: Any history of progressive multifocal
             leukoencephalopathy (PML), chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis of &gt; 1 month
             duration, or primary CNS lymphoma.

          3. Participant has a history of any neoplasm except for the following: resolved kaposi's
             sarcoma, in situ anogenital carcinoma, adequately treated basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, solid tumors (except primary CNS lymphoma) treated with
             curative therapy and disease free for more than 5 years. History of renal cell
             carcinoma requires disease free state for 2 years. History of leukemia and
             disease-free duration will be per site policy.

          4. Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding. Note: Participants who become pregnant
             post-transplant will continue to be followed in the study and will be managed per
             clinical practice. Women that become pregnant should not breastfeed.
