      therapy for PTSD.

      The objective of this study is to examine the effects of art therapy with combat veterans
      who have PTSD and to measure if it reduces symptoms more than verbal Cognitive Processing
      Therapy (CPT) alone. This study will incorporate art processes and materials into an already
      established protocol of CPT in order to create a sense of safety for veterans in beginning
      therapy, and access the nonverbal parts of the trauma in order to process it. Art-making
      will be used to help veterans address trauma and integrate who they were before the trauma
      with who they are currently. It will assist in addressing the grief and loss caused by
      combat, and will be used as veterans begin building a worldview and self-concept that are
      not filled with trauma and war. It is hypothesized that the veterans who receive art therapy
      with CPT will show a significantly greater decrease in PTSD symptoms than those who receive
      only CPT.
