  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is one of the most common disorders in patients with central nervous system
      diseases such as stroke. Transcranial direct current stimulation stimulation (tDCS) is a
      noninvasive tool that can be used to modulate cortical excitability of the leg motor area,
      and the spinal motor circuits as well.

      Objective:The objectives of this study is to examine the efficacy of anodal tDCS combined
      with Biodex balance training on lower limbs spasticity in chronic stroke patients using
      laboratory and clinical assessments.

    <textblock>
      In a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded clinical study, hemiplegic chronic stroke
      patients are randomized to receive active tDCS delivered to lesioned leg motor cortex (CZ)
      or sham combined with balance training with Biodex balance system.

      Experimental group receive tDCS stimulation (2mA) for 20 min, 5 sessions in five days paired
      with 20 min balance training.
