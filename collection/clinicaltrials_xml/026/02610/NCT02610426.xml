      This research trial studies whole exome sequencing in finding causative variants in germline
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from patients with congestive heart failure receiving
      therapy for breast cancer. Studying samples of germline DNA in the laboratory from patients
      with congestive heart failure receiving therapy for breast cancer may help doctors learn
      more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to congestive heart
      failure.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify, using next generation sequencing, rare variants of large effect size that
      impact the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients from the clinical trial
      ECOG-5103 (E5103).

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected germline DNA samples are analyzed via whole exome sequencing.
