  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ib study will identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of AZD1775 monotherapy
      when administered orally once daily (QD) or two times per day (BID) on Days 1 to 5 followed
      by 9 days of rest in 14-day cycles, or QD on a 5/2 dosing schedule (5 days on, followed by 2
      days rest) in 21-day cycles in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours.
      Alternative treatment schedules may be explored if preliminary data suggest these would be
      more appropriate.

      The effect of food on single dose PK of AZD1775 will be assessed in 12 patients. In this
      sub-study, patients will receive a single oral dose of AZD1775 with 240 mL of water, once in
      the fasted state and once following a high-fat meal.

      This study will be conducted in two parts - designated Part A and Part B. Part A will
      attempt to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of
      AZD1775 monotherapy when administered orally once daily (QD) or two times per day (BID) on
      Days 1 to 5 followed by 9 days of rest in 14-day cycles, or QD on a 5/2 dosing schedule (5
      days on, followed by 2 days rest) in 21-day cycles in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumours. Both the QD 5/9 and 5/2 dosing schedules will run in parallel. An
      evaluation will be made after the second QD cohort has been completed to determine whether
      to proceed with one or both dosing schedules.

      The AZD1775 MTD will be determined through dose-escalation using a 3+3 cohort design. If
      less than one-third of evaluable patients in a given cohort (0 of 3 patients or 1 of 6
      patients) experiences a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT); escalation may proceed to the next
      higher dose level. If one of the first 3 patients enrolled in a given cohort experiences a
      DLT, 3 additional patents will be enrolled in that cohort. If a DLT is observed in one-third
      or more of patients, the dose at which this occurs will be considered not tolerated and the
      MTD will have been exceeded. The highest dose level(s) at which less than one-third of
      patients (0 of 3 patients or 1 of 6 patients) experiences a DLT will be declared the MTD. Up
      to 6 patients will be enrolled in each cohort. Dose escalation will continue until
      identification of the MTD or Sponsor termination of the study.

      A minimum of 12 participants will be enrolled and treated at the QD MTD/RP2D for safety
      evaluation. Of these, a minimum of 6 participants will be assessed for food effect prior to
      further expansion of this dose level in Part B. Assuming a maximum of 6 QD dose escalation
      cohorts, approximately 48 evaluable subjects are expected to be enrolled and treated in the
      QD dose escalation portion of the study; including subjects in the BID dose escalation
      cohorts approximately 60 evaluable subjects may be included. Further, an additional 12
      subjects will be evaluated for safety at the MTD/RP2D dose from the QD portion of the study.
      Approximately 6 subjects may be added to replace non-evaluable patients. Therefore, a total
      of 78 patients are expected to be treated in Part A.

      Dose-limiting toxicities will be evaluated during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment. If
      appropriate the DLT observation period can be expanded by up to 2 weeks in case of treatment
      delay due to study drug-related adverse events. Toxicity will be graded according to the
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version
      4.03. Patients must complete Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 safety evaluations which will conclude on
      Cycle 3 Day 1, and must receive at least 80% of the planned dose to be considered evaluable.
      Patients receiving less than 80% of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 dose (28 days) will be replaced
      unless they experienced a confirmed DLT.

      The patient population used to determine the MTD will consist of patients who have met the
      minimum safety evaluation requirements of the study, and/or who have experienced a DLT in
      Cycle 1 or Cycle 2. Minimum safety requirements will be met if during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 of
      treatment the patient receives a minimum of 80% of treatment doses of AZD1775, completes the
      safety evaluations, and is observed for at least 28 days. Patients who do not meet these
      minimum safety evaluation and treatment requirements and whom do not experience a DLT will
      be replaced.

      The dose expansion part of the study (Part B) will further explore the efficacy and safety
      of the RP2D of AZD1775 monotherapy in ovarian cancer patients who have confirmed BRCA1
      and/or BRCA2 mutation. Approximately 20 ovarian cancer patients who have progressed on a
      PARP-inhibitor will be enrolled.

      Patients will be allowed to continue treatment with AZD1775 until evidence of disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criterion has occurred.
