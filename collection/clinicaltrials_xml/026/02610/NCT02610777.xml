    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pevonedistat plus
      azacitidine versus single-agent azacitidine in participants with higher-risk myelodysplastic
      syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and low-blast acute myelogenous leukemia.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called pevonedistat. Pevonedistat is being tested to
      treat people with myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and low-blast
      acute myelogenous leukemia as a combination treatment with azacitidine. This study will look
      at the overall survival, event free survival and response to treatment in people who take
      pevonedistat and azacitidine when compared to people who take single-agent azacitidine.

      The study will enroll approximately 117 participants. Once enrolled, participants will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in
      28-day treatment cycles:

        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 and azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 combination

        -  Single-agent azacitidine 75 mg/m^2

      All participants will receive azacitidine via intravenous or subcutaneous route.
      Participants randomized to the combination arm will also receive pevonedistat intravenous
      infusion.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 69 months. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 30
      days after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent anti-neoplastic
      therapy if that occurs sooner. Participants will enter event-free survival follow-up (study
      visits every 3 months) if their disease has not transformed to AML (for participants with HR
      MDS or CMML) or progressed (for participants with low-blast AML), and they have not started
      subsequent therapy. Participants will also enter overall survival follow-up (contacted every
      3 months to document subsequent therapies and survival status).

    <time_frame>From randomization until transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, disease progression or death due to any cause, up to 69 months</time_frame>
    <description>EFS is defined as time from randomization until transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or death due to any cause whichever occurs first for participants with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), or disease progression or relapse after CR or death due to any cause whichever occurs first for participants with low-blast AML. Transformation to AML is defined as a participant having 20% blasts in blood or marrow and increase of blast count by 50%. Disease progression for low blast-AML is defined as 1 of following: &gt;50% increase in bone marrow blasts or circulating blasts from baseline value to &gt;30% blasts; development of biopsy-proven extramedullary disease, or new sites of extramedullary leukemia. Relapse after CR is defined as a reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood or &gt;= 5% blasts in bone marrow not attributable to any other cause (eg, bone marrow regeneration after consolidation therapy).</description>

An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; or a medically important event.

          2. Morphologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS or nonproliferative CMML (that is, with
             white blood cells [WBC] &lt;20,000 per microliter [/mcL]) or low-blast AML based on 1 of
             the following:

             French-American-British (FAB) Classifications:

               -  Refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) - defined as having 5% to 20%
                  myeloblasts in the bone marrow.

               -  CMML with 10% to 19% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and/or 5% to 19% blasts in
                  the blood.

             OR

             Worl health organisation (WHO) Classifications:

               -  RAEB-1 - defined as having 5% to 9% myeloblasts in the bone marrow.

               -  RAEB-2 - defined as having 10% to 19% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and/or 5%
                  to 19% blasts in the blood.

               -  CMML-2 - defined as having 10% to 19% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and/or 5%
                  to 19% blasts in the blood.

               -  CMML-1 (Although CMML-1 is defined as having &lt;10% myeloblasts in the bone marrow
                  and/or &lt;5% blasts in the blood, these participants may enroll only if bone
                  marrow blasts &gt;=5%.

               -  WHO-defined AML with 20%-30% myeloblasts in the bone marrow and &lt;30% myeloblasts

               -  Very high (&gt;6 points),

               -  High (&gt;4.5 - 6 points), or

                  Intermediate Prognostic Risk Category is only allowable in the setting of &gt;=5%
                  bone marrow myeloblasts.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.

          6. For CMML participants: WBC count &lt;20,000/mcL before administration of the first dose
             of study drug on Cycle 1 Day 1; participants must have been off hydroxyurea for at

                  method and 1 additional effective (barrier) method of contraception at the same
                  time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 4 months after the
                  last dose of study drug, or

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar,
                  ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] withdrawal, spermicides only,
                  and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female
                  and male condoms should not be used together).

             Male participants, even if surgically sterilized (that is, status postvasectomy),
             who:

               -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the participant. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar,
                  ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner]
                  withdrawal, spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable
                  methods of contraception. Female and male condoms should not be used together).

         10. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          9. Major surgery within 14 days before first dose or a scheduled surgery during study
             period; insertion of a venous access device (eg, catheter, port) is not considered

             pulmonary hypertension. As an example, well-controlled atrial fibrillation would not
             be an exclusion whereas uncontrolled atrial fibrillation would be an exclusion.
