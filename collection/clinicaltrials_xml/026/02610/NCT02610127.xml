  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to enroll patients with acquired hemophilia A (AHA) who are
      prescribed and treated with Obizur, to assess safety, and to describe factors related to
      safety, utilization and effectiveness in a real-world setting.

      This study is a multi-center, uncontrolled, open-label, non-interventional post-marketing
      safety surveillance study to describe the use of Obizur in patients with acquired hemophilia
      A (AHA), and secondarily, where data are available, to describe the hemostatic effectiveness
      and immunogenicity of Obizur.

      Patients should be enrolled at the earliest possible time point, but within ten days of
      initiating Obizur to ensure unbiased prospective observation.

      In addition, in an attempt to collect all safety and utilization data on patients treated
      with Obizur since Food and Drug Administration approval, Baxalta will conduct a
      retrospective chart review on persons treated with Obizur prior to the prospective study
      start date (Retrospective study participants may or may not also participate in the
      prospective portion of the study).
