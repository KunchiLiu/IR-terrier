    <textblock>
      This research trial studies whole exome sequencing in finding causative variants in germline
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from patients with hypertension receiving bevacizumab
      for breast cancer. Studying samples of germline DNA in the laboratory from patients with
      hypertension receiving bevacizumab for breast cancer may help doctors learn about changes
      that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to hypertension.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify, using next generation sequencing, rare variants of large effect size that
      impact the risk of hypertension in patients from the clinical trial Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG)-5103 (E5103).

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected germline DNA samples are analyzed via whole exome sequencing.
