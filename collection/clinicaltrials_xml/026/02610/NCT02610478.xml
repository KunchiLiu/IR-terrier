    <textblock>
      Background:

      Most people infected with the influenza virus have mild symptoms. But some get very sick and
      even die. Antibodies in the part of the blood called plasma fight germs like influenza.
      Researchers want to see if plasma with high levels of antibodies helps more than plasma with
      low levels when transfused into people with influenza. They have plasma from people with
      high levels of antibodies from being infected with influenza or getting the influenza
      vaccine. They also have plasma with low or no antibodies.

      Objective:

      To see if plasma with high levels of antibodies works better than plasma with low levels to
      treat influenza.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 2 weeks and older who are hospitalized for symptoms of influenza

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and blood and urine tests. They may have
      a nasal wash test for influenza. For this, they get a saline rinse in one nostril. A plastic
      tube inserted in the nostril collects fluid.

      The study lasts 28 days.

      Participants will get routine influenza care. This includes standard drugs and possible
      chest x-rays.

      On Day 1, participants will have:

      Physical exam

      Blood tests

      Throat swab

      2 doses of plasma with high antibodies or low antibodies by IV catheter (tube) in a vein.

      On Days 3 and 7, participants will return to the clinic, if no longer hospitalized, for
      1-hour visits. The visits include:

      Medical exam

      Blood tests

      Throat swab

      On Days 2, 14, and 28, participants will be evaluated either at the clinic or by phone. They
      will talk about their symptoms.

      Significant morbidity and mortality from influenza infections occur despite treatment with
      current antivirals. This randomized, double-blinded, multicenter phase 3 trial will assess
      the efficacy and safety of high-titer versus low-titer anti-influenza immune plasma in
      addition to standard care antivirals for the treatment of severe influenza A. Hospitalized
      subjects with severe influenza A will be eligible for study participation. Up to 40 sites in
      the United States will participate in this protocol. Adults and children may participate.
      There is no exclusion for pregnancy.

      A total of 150 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either
      high-titer anti-influenza plasma or control (low-titer) plasma. All plasma is from male
      donors to minimize the risk of TRALI.

      Subjects will be assessed on Study Day 0 (baseline) and on Study Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and
      28. For participants who are not hospitalized on Days 2, 14, and 28, contact with the
      participant for the purpose of limited study data collection for those days may be performed
      by telephone. Study visits on Days 1, 3, 7 must occur in person. All subjects will undergo a
      series of efficacy, safety, and HAI assessments during the study. Blood samples will be
      collected on Day 0, 1, 3, and 7. OP swabs for influenza PCR will be obtained on Days 0 and
      3.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ENROLLMENT (SCREENING):

          -  Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of influenza (decision for hospitalization
             will be up to the individual treating clinician).

          -  Study plasma available on-site or available within 24 hours after randomization.

          -  Not previously screened nor randomized in this study.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RANDOMIZATION:

          -  The NIH site will only subjects 18 years of age or greater.

          -  Locally determined positive test for influenza A (by PCR, other nucleic acid testing,
             or by rapid Ag) from a specimen obtained less than or equal to 48 hours prior to
             randomization.

          -  Onset of illness less than or equal to 6 days before randomization, defined as when
             the subject first experienced at least one respiratory symptom or fever.

          -  Hospitalized due to influenza, with anticipated hospitalization for more than 24
             hours after randomization. Criteria for hospitalization will be up to the individual
             treating clinician.

          -  Willingness to have blood and respiratory samples obtained and stored.

          -  Willingness to return for all required study visits and participate in study follow
             up.

          -  NEW score greater than or equal to 3 within 12 hours prior to randomization (or PEW
             [pediatric early warning] score greater than or equal to 3 within 12 hours prior to
             randomization).

          -  ABO-compatible plasma available on-site or available within 24 hours after
             randomization.

          -  The subject is able to provide informed consent

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RANDOMIZATION:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study participation:

          -  Strong clinical evidence in the judgment of the site investigator that the etiology
             of illness is primarily bacterial super-infection in origin. Co-infection would be
             allowed, as there may be benefit to resolving influenza illness faster.
             Super-infection, where influenza illness occurred and is resolving, and new bacterial
             illness causing deterioration should be excluded.

          -  Prior treatment with any anti-influenza investigational drug, IVIG, or plasma therapy
             within 30 days prior to screening. Other investigational drug therapies
             (non-influenza) are allowed.

          -  History of allergic reaction to blood or plasma products (as judged by the site
             investigator).

          -  A pre-existing condition or use of a medication that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, may place the individual at a substantially increased risk of
             thrombosis (e.g., cryoglobulinemia, severe refractory hypertriglyceridemia, or
             clinically significant monoclonal gammopathy). Prior IVIG use alone would not meet
             exclusion criteria, but the investigator should consider the potential for a
             hyper-coagulable state.

          -  Subjects who, in the judgment of the site investigator, will be unlikely to comply
             with the requirements of this protocol, including being uncontactable following
             discharge from hospital.

          -  Medical conditions for which receipt of 500-600 mL of intravenous fluid may be
             dangerous to the subject (e.g., decompensated congestive heart failure).

          -  Women that are pregnant or actively breast feeding (NIH site).
