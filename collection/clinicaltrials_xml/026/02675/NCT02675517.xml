  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to measure changes in physical functioning - serving
      as a surrogate for physical activity and exercise capacity - in COPD patients being treated
      with Spiolto® Respimat® after approximately 6 weeks. A secondary objective is to evaluate
      the patient¿s general condition (physician¿s evaluation) at visit 1 (baseline visit at the
      start of the study) and at visit 2 (final visit at the end of the study, approx. 6 weeks
      after visit 1), as well as patient satisfaction with Spiolto® Respimat® at visit 2.

          3. Patients diagnosed with COPD and requiring long-acting dual bronchodilation (LAMA +

          3. Patients continuing LABA-iCS treatment should not be additionally treated with
             Spiolto® Respimat® in order to avoid a double dosing of long-acting beta-agonists
