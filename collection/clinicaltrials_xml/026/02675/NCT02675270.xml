      The goal of this study is to remediate word-finding problems in patients with Primary
      Progressive Aphasia (PPA) and to delay the further progression of word-finding impairment.
      The current approach is novel in that it contains a prophylaxis component in which the
      investigators attempt to strengthen neural connections that remain functional, making them
      more resistant to degradation as the disease progresses. While the study is specific in its
      targeting of word-finding problems, a successful outcome would bode well for other studies
      aimed at prevention or reversal of declining cognitive functions in dementia. Patients with
      PPA whose naming of pictures has just begun to show signs of decline will receive practice
      with picture naming in two conditions: viewing the picture and repeating the name; and
      viewing the picture with its written name, plus reading and writing the name. Naming of
      pictures trained in each of these conditions will be compared, at three time intervals
      post-training, with naming of pictures tested before the study but never trained. A
      scene-description task containing trained items will be used to assess generalization. It is
      predicted that the pairing of the picture with its written name, combined with the motor
      task of writing the name, will result in a greater ability to name the picture at a later
      date than simple practice viewing the picture and repeating the name. Generalization to
      other exemplars and to other task situations is also predicted.
