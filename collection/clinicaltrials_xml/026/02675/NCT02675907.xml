    <measure>Summed pain intensity difference over the first 48 hours (SPID48)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was recorded using a Numeric Rating Scale (Range 0-10) where 0 equates to no pain, and 10 equates to the worst pain imaginable. Pain intensity scores were to be recorded at the following time points: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2 hours post Dose 1. Thereafter pain assessments were to be recorded every 2 hours until 48 hours. Pain intensity differences from baseline at each time point were calculated and a time weighted SPID was then calculated. Time weighted SPID calculations were computed by multiplying a weight factor to each score prior to summation. The weight factor at each time point was the time elapsed since the previous observation.</description>
