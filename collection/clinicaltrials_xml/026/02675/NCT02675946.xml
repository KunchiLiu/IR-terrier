  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study consisting of a Dose Escalation Phase and a
      Dose Expansion Phase to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Dose Escalation Phase is to examine the safety and determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of CGX1321 when administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors including
      GI tumors that have relapsed or are refractory to or not considered medically suitable to
      receive standard of care treatment who meet the entry criteria.

      Once the dose is identified in the Dose Escalation Phase, the Dose Expansion Phase will
      start. The purpose of the Dose Expansion Phase is to continue to examine the safety and
      confirm the final Phase 2 dose of CGX1321 when administered to subjects with advanced GI
      tumors who meet the entry criteria.

    <description>Dose Escalation Phase: Ascending doses of CGX1321 will be administered by cohort to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Patients will receive CGX1321, once daily, orally, for 3 weeks (21 days) followed by a one-week (7-day) washout period in each 28-day cycle, according to the cohort they are assigned.
Dose Expansion Phase: Patients will receive the recommended dose (identified in the Dose Expansion Phase) of CGX1321.</description>
