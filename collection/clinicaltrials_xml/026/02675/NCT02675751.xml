        NOTE: Enrollment open only to military personnel

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent and HIPAA authorization.

          -  Refractive error, based on the iDesign displayed refraction must be myopia with or
             without astigmatism with sphere up to -8.00 D, and cylinder between 0.00 D and -4.00
             D with maximum SE of -10.00 D.

          -  Anticipated residual stromal bed thickness of at least 250 microns as calculated by
             the iDesign system.

          -  Distance Best Spectacle Corrected Visual Acuity (BSCVA) of 20/20 or better

          -  BSCVA ≥2 lines (≥10 letters) better than distance Uncorrected Visual Acuity (UCVA).

          -  Less than or equal to 0.75 D difference between cycloplegic and manifest refraction
             sphere.

          -  Stable refractive error as defined by a change of ≤1.00 D in MRSE over at least a 12
             month time period.

          -  Any subject eye with a history of contact lens wear within the last 4 weeks must
             demonstrate refractive stability

          -  Agreement between manifest refraction (adjusted for optical infinity) and iDesign
             System refraction chosen for treatment.

          -  Willing and capable of complying with follow-up examinations for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or intend to become pregnant, or not using an
             adequate method of birth control.

          -  Concurrent use of systemic (including inhaled) medications that may impair healing.

          -  History of any of the following medical conditions, or any other condition that could
             affect wound healing: collagen vascular disease, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency
             diseases, ocular herpes zoster or herpes simplex, endocrine disorders (including, but
             not limited to unstable thyroid disorders and diabetes), lupus, and rheumatoid
             arthritis.

          -  Subjects with a cardiac pacemaker, implanted defibrillator or other implanted
             electronic device.

          -  History of prior intraocular or corneal surgery, active ophthalmic disease or
             abnormality, retinal detachment/repair, clinically significant lens opacity, clinical
             evidence of trauma, corneal opacity within the central 9 mm and visible on
             topography, at risk for developing strabismus, or with evidence of glaucoma or
             propensity for narrow angle glaucoma.

          -  Evidence of keratoconus, corneal dystrophy or irregularity, or abnormal topography

          -  Known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the medications used in
             this study.

          -  If either eye does not meet all inclusion criteria

          -  Desire to have monovision.

          -  Participation in any other clinical study, with the exception of the fellow eye in
             this study.
