  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general hypothesis put forward in this study is that the degree of cohesion (agreement)
      in the relationship, or dyadic adjustment affects a patient's quality of life and clinical
      course during the first few critical months following diagnosis and the introduction of
      treatment. The level of cohesion in the relationship is certainly not the only parameter
      associated with changes in the quality of life. Other factors must also be investigated such
      as level of education, circumstances surrounding the diagnosis (new diagnosis or relapse),
      management (single therapy or adjuvant therapy), the level of physical activity, the
      patient's age and the presence of functional disorders, etc.
