  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a bone labeled calcium tracer methodology to compare the dose response
      effect of blueberry consumption on calcium retention and bone loss. Post menopausal women
      will receive food or beverage products containing freeze dried blueberries over a 50 day
      period equivalent to low (0.75 cups), medium (1.5 cups), and high (3 cups) of fresh berries.
      The hypothesis is that the polyphenolic content of higher doses of blueberries will reduce
      calcium loss from bones.

      Participants will be dosed with Ca-41, a rare long lived radioisotope. After equilibration
      in the bone tissues (150 days) subjects will be assigned to one of six randomization schemes
      all of which begin (day 0) with a 50 day baseline period during which 24 h urine will be
      collected every 10 days. Following the baseline period subjects will be randomized to one of
      three doses of blueberries equivalent to 0.75 (low), 1.5 (medium), and 3 cups (high) of
      blueberries per day. In a crossover design each participant will complete three 50 d
      intervention phases(low, medium, high dose of berries) in randomized order, each followed by
      a 50 day washout phase. Each dose will be provided as freeze dried blueberry powder in 2-4
      food products or beverages per day. The dose response effect of continuous blueberry
      consumption over a 50 day period on bone resorption in healthy post-menopausal women will be
      studied by measuring the loss of Ca41 in the urine using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry..

    <description>Before the beginning of the study eligible participants will receive a radioactive tracer, Ca-41, by iv infusion. 150 days will be required for equilibration in the body i.e. elimination of the tracer from soft tissue and deposition in the bone.
