    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate perianal fistula healing at Week 30 in 2 different
      dose regimens of vedolizumab intravenous (IV) 300 milligram (mg) in participants with
      fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD).

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab IV. Vedolizumab IV is being tested
      to treat people who have fistulizing CD. This study will look at fistula healing in people
      who take vedolizumab IV.

      The study will enroll approximately 126 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Group 1: Vedolizumab IV 300 mg dose at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22, and a placebo infusion
           at Week 10 (dummy inactive infusion - this is a solution that looks like the study drug
           but has no active ingredient).

        -  Group 2: Vedolizumab IV 300 mg dose at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 10, 14 and 22.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study from screening to 18 weeks after the last dose is 44 weeks. Participants will make
      multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 6 months after last dose
      of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

             or history of cervical carcinoma in situ that has been adequately treated and that
             has not recurred for at least 3 years prior to Screening. Participants with a remote
             history of malignancy (eg, &gt;10 years since completion of curative therapy without
             recurrence) will be considered based on the nature of the malignancy and the therapy

         32. Has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history of alcohol
