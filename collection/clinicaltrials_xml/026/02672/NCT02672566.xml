  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constituted vascular intrauterine growth restriction (CVIG) is correlated to an abnormal
      placenta development, with an alteration of the maternal-fetal circulation, coagulation
      troubles, and apparition of placental infarcts. CVIG represents the third cause of perinatal
      mortality in France, and is associated to an important morbidity. For birth-weights &lt; 10th
      percentile of the gestational age, the neonatal death risk is doubled, compared to abnormal
      weights. 35% of CVIG are linked to vascular causes and are integrated in the placental
      vascular diseases.

      To answer this objective, researchers propose a multicentric clinical trial, randomized,
      open, in two parallel groups, comparing the enoxaparin subcutaneous administration at
      preventive doses associated to the usual care (group 1) versus the usual care only (group
      2). The inclusion of 81 patients per group is scheduled, meaning 162 patients in total.
      Participation for each patient starts at the first consultation until 1 month after
      delivery. Inclusion time is 22 months. Total duration is 26 months.

      Constituted vascular intrauterine growth restriction (CVIG) is correlated to an abnormal
      placenta development, with an alteration of the maternal-fetal circulation, coagulation
      troubles, and apparition of placental infarcts. CVIG represents the third cause of perinatal
      mortality in France, and is associated to an important morbidity. For birth-weights &lt; 10th
      percentile of the gestational age, the neonatal death risk is doubled, compared to abnormal
      weights. 35% of CVIG are linked to vascular causes and are integrated in the placental
      vascular diseases.

      Nowadays, studies are focused on prevention, with an efficacy limited for aspirin and
      heparin of low molecular weight (LMWH). Few studies have evaluated the treatments in CVIG
      cases. Aspirin did not show the efficacy in case of pathological uterine dopplers. Only one
      randomized study studied the LMWH at preventive doses during 14 days in the CVIG. In this
      open clinical trial including 73 patients, results were in favor for the heparin group :
      significantly improvement of the growth kinetic for fetus with a upper birth weight. These
      encouraging results suggest that LMWH are a physio-pathological treatment for CVIG and
      consequently, improve the intrauterine growth.

      However, this preliminary data are insufficient. Basically, the CVIG support is based on an
      active watch with extraction in case of maternal or fetal suffering.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the enoxaparin treatment at preventive
      doses (4 000 Ui/Day) administered during the CVIG diagnosis until the birth or at maximum 36
      weeks of amenorrhea, to decrease the risk of new born with a weight birth &lt; 10th percentile
      for the gestational age.

      To answer this objective, researchers propose a multicentric clinical trial, randomized,
      open, in two parallel groups, comparing the enoxaparin subcutaneous administration at
      preventive doses associated to the usual care (group 1) versus the usual care only (group
      2). The inclusion of 81 patients per group is scheduled, meaning 162 patients in total.
      Participation for each patient starts at the first consultation until 1 month after
      delivery. Inclusion time is 22 months. Total duration is 26 months.
