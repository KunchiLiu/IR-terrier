  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate topical treatment with Veregen™ 15% ointment as
      a single therapeutic agent and compare it to combination therapy with Veregen ™ 15% ointment
      and a single destructive treatment by cryotherapy for non-facial verruca vulgaris in the
      pediatric population. The investigators will compare the single and combination treatment
      modalities over identical time points in patients with non-facial verruca vulgaris. One of
      the current options for care for non-facial verruca includes cryotherapy, which is a painful
      and destructive method performed in the pediatric dermatology clinic. This study aims to
      establish the safety, non-invasivenature, efficiency, and efficacy of Veregen ™ 15% ointment
      as monotherapyfor non-facial verruca vulgaris in the pediatric population. The investigators
      hypothesize that Veregen ™ 15% ointment monotherapy will non-invasively treat non-facial
      verruca vulgaris with similar efficacy as combination therapy with a single cryotherapy
      treatment followed by topical application of Veregen ™ ointment. This novel treatment
      modality will be useful in the pediatric dermatology community offering a less invasive,
      painless option for treatment of non-facial verruca vulgaris.

    <description>Cryotherapy will be performed on the day of first clinic visit according to current standard of care in Children's Medical Center pediatric outpatient dermatology clinic, which consists of two freeze/thaw cycles for maximum of 10 seconds each. Veregen ™ 15% ointment will be prescribed and initiated immediately following the day of first clinic visit. Veregen ™ 15% ointment will be applied to verrucous lesions twice daily per current Children's Medical Center protocol. Follow-up clinical visits will be required at 0 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. The first day of treatment will begin on the day of first clinic visit (0 weeks). Clinical photos will be taken at each visit. Verrucae will be measured at each visit using a standard ruler. Outcome measures will be numerical reduction in diameter of verruca.</description>
