  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics
      of prophylactic emicizumab treatment in patients previously treated with episodic or
      prophylactic bypassing agents. Episodic bypassing agent patients will be randomized in a 2:1
      fashion to receive emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm A) versus no prophylaxis (Arm B) and will be
      stratified across Arms A and B according to the number of bleeds they experienced over the
      last 24 weeks prior to study entry (less than [&lt;] 9 or greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 9
      bleeds); Arm B patients will have the opportunity to switch to emicizumab prophylaxis after
      24 weeks on-study. Prophylactic bypassing agent patients will switch to emicizumab
      prophylaxis (Arm C) from the start of the trial; enrollment will be extended for 24 weeks
      after the last patient has enrolled in Arms A or B or until approximately 50 patients have
      enrolled in Arm C, whichever occurs first. Episodic bypassing agent patients who previously
      participated in a Non-Interventional Study BH29768 but were unable to enroll in Arms A or B
      prior to their closure will have the opportunity to enroll in Arm D until 24 weeks after the
      last patient has enrolled in Arms A or B or until approximately 35 patients have enrolled in
      Arm D, whichever occurs first. Like patients in Arms A and C, Arm D patients will receive
      emicizumab prophylaxis from the start of the trial. All patients will continue to receive
      standard of care/background treatment with their usual episodic bypassing agent therapy to
      treat breakthrough bleeds, as needed.
