  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      We are involved in testing new behavioral science methods and measures for future research
      projects. In the course of these evaluations, we will also test research questions related
      to parents psychological experiences and how these relate to the responses they have when
      they encounter different types of communication about child health. We are testing multiple
      research questions in the course of this research.

      Objective:

      - To learn about technologies and approaches to use in future research studies.

      Eligibility:

      - Parents (fathers and mothers) of children between the ages of 3-7.

      Design:

      As part of the main study, participants will do four tasks:

      Task 1: Before participants arrive for an in-person visit, they will answer questions online
      about themselves, their child, and their thoughts and opinions related to health.

      Task 2: At the in-person visit, participants will watch a short scene from a movie and
      answer some questions

      Task 3: At the in-person visit, participants will read information about a child health
      topic and answer questions

      Task 4: At the in-person visit, participants will use a virtual reality-based buffet
      restaurant simulation to make hypothetical food choices for their child
