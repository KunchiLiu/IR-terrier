      alternative therapy which can be used to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      related complications.

      cyclical breathing patterns, ranging from slow and calming to rapid and stimulating. It is
      recommended for relaxation, stress management, control of psycho physiological states and to
      improve organ function. Investigator will recruit 50 type 2 diabetic patient and those who
      consent will be randomized into two groups. Interventional group and waitlist control group.
