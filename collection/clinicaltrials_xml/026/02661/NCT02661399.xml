  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing a research study that will teach us about the tingly pain that
      people develop when they get chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are asking for a blood sample, information about patients symptoms during
      chemotherapy, and past medical history from people who have taken or will take certain types
      of chemotherapy. The investigators hope to examine blood for proteins that could help us
      learn which patients get neurological symptoms while getting chemotherapy. The
      investigators' main research goal is to improve the treatment of patients getting
      chemotherapy to help their quality of life and/or help to increase the chance of their
      cancer being cured.
