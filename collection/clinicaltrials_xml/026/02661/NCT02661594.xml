             Male subjects

             Male subjects must use medically acceptable methods of contraception if their female

             of treatment or study medication until three months following administration of the
             last treatment or dose of study medication. Acceptable methods include:

               -  Condom used with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository

                  [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] used with spermicidal
                  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) must be used.

               -  The female partner has undergone documented placement of an intrauterine device

                  or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) used with spermicidal
                  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository]).

               -  Documented tubal ligation (female sterilisation). In addition, a barrier method

               -  True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) are not acceptable methods of contraception.
