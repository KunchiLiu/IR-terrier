          2. Subjects who have received permanent implantation (silicone, PAAG, PMMA, CaHA etc) on
             the nasolabial folds

          3. Subjects who have received nonpermanent aesthetic treatments, such as botulinum toxin
             injection or filler on the nasolabial folds within 9 months before screening

          4. Subjects who have received face lifting or plastic surgery on face within 9 months
             before screening

          5. Subjects who have received laser therapy on the nasolabial folds, chemical peeling or
             peeling on face within 3 months before the screening

          6. Subjects who have any skin diseases (including inflammation and skin cancer) or
