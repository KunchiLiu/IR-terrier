  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      CyberHeart System in patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT).

      The ablation will be performed with the CyberHeart System and will target the anatomical
      site of the clinically presenting VT, using standard radiosurgery techniques.

      Cardiac radiosurgery is a minimally-non invasive, painless, procedure. Tissue ablation can
      be accomplished precisely.

      This study is a two center, non-randomized, open label clinical trial.

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      CyberHeart System in patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia.

      The clinical hypothesis for the study is that the CyberHeart treatment approach will be safe
      and with further study will not be shown to be inferior to current treatment options, may
      lead to a survival benefit and improved quality of life.

      The ablation to be performed with the CyberHeart System will be targeting the anatomical
      site of the clinically presenting VT. The application site will be determined by
      morphological criteria on the 12 lead ECG along with anatomical data from MRI or CT scans.
      Ablation will be performed at the designated location with the intention to produce
      substrate modification.

      The Study will enroll a maximum of 10 patients.
