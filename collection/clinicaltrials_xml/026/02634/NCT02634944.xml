  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed project is to determine if the VOMS is an effective screening
      tool to identify and track recovery of vestibular and ocular motor impairment and symptoms
      following mTBI, that corpsman-level medical personnel can successfully implement in combat
      and non-combat environments. A second purpose of the project is to determine if impairment
      and symptoms on the VOMS is more pronounced following blast compared to blunt mTBI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular impairment and symptoms are prevalent following mild traumatic brain injury
      (mTBI) and may play a role in prolonged recovery. Researchers have indicated that ocular
      motor dysfunction and symptoms are common among personnel exposed to blast mTBI. In fact,
      researchers have suggested that vestibular and ocular motor outcomes such as VOR and
      vestibulo-spinal reflex (VSR) may be useful in identifying the effects of blast from blunt
      mTBI. There are currently no brief, clinical screening tools to identify vestibular/ocular
      motor impairment and symptoms in military personnel following mTBI. Our research team
      recently developed the Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) tool to screen for
      vestibular/ocular motor impairment and symptoms following mTBI. Our preliminary research
      indicates that VOMS- a 5-min clinical screening tool that can be deployed by corpsman-level
      (i.e., Special Operation Combat Medics [SOCM], Special Forces Medical Sergeants [18D])
      medical personnel with minimal training and materials- was nearly 90% accurate in
      identifying patients with mTBI from healthy controls. These preliminary findings suggest
      that VOMS may augment current clinical screening tools- such as the MACE- used by the U.S.
      Military. The proposed project addresses the &quot;studies to develop standardized metrics for
      vestibular assessment and monitoring for return to duty&quot; area in the Diagnostics subsection
      of the Hearing Loss/Dysfunction, Balance Disorder, and or Tinnitus section under the
      Clinical Trial Research Focus Area.

    <description>The Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) tool is used to screen for vestibular and ocular motor impairment and symptoms following mTBI (Mucha et al., 2014). The VOMS was developed with the combined input of experts in the assessment of vestibular dysfunction (Drs. Furman, Whitney, Sparto and Mucha) and mTBI (Dr. Collins), and was tested and refined in a two-year period with over 12,000 patients in our concussion clinic at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The VOMS- which requires only a small target with 14 point font text and takes only 5 min to administer- includes assessments in five domains: (1) smooth pursuits, (2) horizontal and vertical saccades, (3) near point of convergence (NPC) distance, (4) horizontal and vertical VOR, and (5) VMS.</description>
