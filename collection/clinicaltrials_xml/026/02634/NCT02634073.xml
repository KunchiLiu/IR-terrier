  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lamivudine (3TC) is a nucleoside analogue indicated in combination with other antiretroviral
      agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults
      and children. Documented literature elucidates that simultaneous administration of multiple
      sorbitol-containing products could increase the potential for a significant interaction and
      may contribute to the lower 3TC exposures.

      In this study several sorbitol doses (3.2 gram (g), 10.2 g, and 13.4 g solutions) will be
      administered with lamivudine to investigate dose dependency and mimic the situation where
      multiple sorbitol-containing antiretroviral medications may be co-administered with
      lamivudine. It will be open label, randomized, 4-way crossover (by William's design method)
      design at a single centre. Randomized participants will receive a single dose of each of
      four treatments after wash out period of minimum 7 days.
