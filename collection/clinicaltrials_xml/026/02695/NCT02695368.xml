    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted at three
      major university and teaching hospitals with a catchment population of approximately 1
      million. In the current study it has been hypothesized that a non-invasive air cleaner
      utilizing a plasma chamber can significantly reduce the incidence of surgical site
      infections (SSIs).

    <intervention_name>Air cleaner with plasma-filter turned on</intervention_name>
    <description>The air-cleaner sterilizes the air particles through a plasma chamber. Air in the operating theatre is pumped through the chamber (80 - 380 m3/Hr) and by using a small current it transforms the gas in the vicinity of the electrode into plasma and eradicates any bacteria that pass through.</description>
