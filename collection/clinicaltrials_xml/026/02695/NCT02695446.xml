  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the skin and plasma concentrations of
      minocycline in subjects undergoing treatment of acne vulgaris with oral extended release
      minocycline. Acne lesion counts and safety/tolerance of the treatment will also be
      evaluated.

      This will be an open label, non randomized, interventional pilot study evaluating the plasma
      and skin levels of minocycline in 10 subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris.
      Subjects with non inflammatory acne of nodular acne will not be enrolled. Subjects will be
      on an oral extended release minocycline regimen of up to 2mg/kg once a day for 4 weeks.

      Steady state levels of minocycline in plasma and skin will be determined.
