    <textblock>
      This childhood obesity randomized controlled trial uses innovative methods, such as video
      feedback and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) to compare a family meals coaching
      intervention to a usual care condition in racially/ethnically diverse children ages 5-7
      years and their families. The intervention utilizes in-home visiting methods targeting
      family meal quantity and quality delivered across a three-phased incremental 18-month period
      compared to obesity prevention messages delivered during well-child visits and monthly
      newsletters.

    <textblock>
      The main objective of the current study is to utilize state-of-the art methods and
      intervention techniques (i.e., EMI, video feedback, in-home visiting) in partnership with
      primary care to examine whether increasing the quantity and quality of family meals reduces
      childhood obesity. An individual randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted with
      socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse children ages 5-7 years at high risk for
      obesity (BMI ≥75%ile, or ≥50th%ile and parent BMI ≥ 25) and their families. Families will be
      randomly assigned to the family meals coaching (FMC) intervention or usual care. There will
      be three incremental phases of the 18-month intervention: (1) Interactive Learning (6
      months; 12 in-home visits); (2) Making Changes (6 months; 8 in-home visits); and (3)
      Maintenance (6 months; 6 phone calls). Using in-home visits, video feedback about family
      meal behaviors (e.g., dietary healthfulness, parent feeding practices, interpersonal
      atmosphere), daily EMI prompts via smartphones, and well-child visits in primary care,
      families in FMC will be supported to increase the quantity and quality of family meals. The
      phases progressively provide less support for families to increase self-efficacy and
      sustainability of new behaviors. Usual care will include obesity prevention messages
      delivered at well-child visits (i.e., 5-2-1-0)44 and monthly mailings. Outcomes will be
      assessed at the end of each phase (6 months, 12 months), post-intervention (18 months) and 6
      months post-intervention (24 months).

      Aim 1: Conduct an RCT comparing the family meals coaching (FMC) intervention to usual care
      in racially/ethnically diverse children ages 5-7 and their families to test the hypotheses
      that:

      Hypothesis 1: Family meal quantity and quality will significantly increase in households
      with children in the FMC condition compared to children in the usual care condition.

      Hypothesis 2: Children in the FMC condition will significantly increase their diet quality
      and reduce their BMI%ile compared to children in the usual care condition.

      Hypothesis 3: Parents in the FMC condition will show significant reductions in restriction
      and pressure-to-eat feeding practices as compared to parents in the usual care condition.

      Aim 2: Examine intervention &quot;spillover&quot; effects in other family members exposed to the
      intervention.

      Hypothesis 1: Family members in the FMC condition will significantly reduce their
      BMI/BMI%ile and increase healthful weight-related behaviors compared to family members in
      the usual care condition.

      Aim 3: Measure the cost-effectiveness of delivering the intervention via Patient Centered
      Medical Homes PCMHs.

      Hypothesis 1: The BMI%ile reduction resulting from the FMC intervention will be
      cost-effective.

    <description>The Family Matters experimental arm uses obesity prevention messages (i.e., 5-2-1-0 messages) delivered during well-child visits, ecological momentary intervention, video feedback and home visiting to increase family meal quality and quantity. The intervention will be delivered to racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children ages 5-7 years at high risk for obesity (i.e., child BMI ≥75%ile or ≥ 50th%ile and parent ≥ 25 BMI) and their families over an 18-month time period. The intervention will be delivered using an incremental three-phased approach (i.e., Interactive Learning, Making Changes, Maintenance), allowing for progressively less support for families to increase self-efficacy and sustainability behaviors. Eligible children will be recruited through primary care clinics serving a high proportion of children at high-risk for obesity, including minority (i.e., African American, Native American, Hispanic) and low-income populations.</description>

    <description>The experimental arm includes three incremental phases over 18 months. Phase I includes 12 bi-weekly in-home visits that last 90 mins. facilitated by a behavioral health and dietitian team. Meal quality and quantity will be targeted. The primary caregiver will also receive daily EMI messages about increasing meal quantity and quality via a smartphone, based on the stress level reported earlier in the day. Phase II visits will occur every 3 weeks over 6 months. Daily EMI prompts will continue and video feedback will be introduced. In between visits, families will video-record via an iPad at least 3 family dinner meals. Family meal coaches will watch the videos in between home visits to identify specific footage to show family members at the next in-home visit that highlights both positive and negative family interactions and diet quality patterns. During Phase III, parents will receive monthly booster phone calls for six months. The EMI and the video feedback will discontinue.</description>

    <description>The usual care condition will receive childhood obesity prevention messages (i.e., 5-2-1-0) from primary care providers and monthly newsletters focusing on general child health. All clinics in the study already use 5-2-1-0 messages for childhood obesity prevention. These are evidence-based messages (i.e., 5 fruits and vegetables/day; no more than 2 hours of screen time/day; at least 1 hour of physical activity/day; 0 sugar-sweetened beverages/day) that providers share with parents during well-child visits. The monthly newsletters will cover general child health issues, such as car seat safety, immunizations, etc.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: The inclusionary criteria used to select participants includes:

          -  Boys and girls ages 5-7 years old who attend a University of Minnesota or Fairview
             primary care clinic, their primary caregiver, and at least one other family member.

          -  ≤3 family dinner meals per week: observational research has shown that youth who have
             three or more family meals per week are less likely to be obese ten years later.
             Thus, we will recruit families who report three or fewer family dinner meals per week
             in order to optimize the potential for change in family dinner meal frequency. We
             will use &quot;family dinners&quot; as the definition of family meals because the majority of
             families report having family dinners compared to breakfast or lunch family meals.

          -  At-risk for childhood obesity, including: (1) age and gender adjusted BMI ≥75th
             percentile or (2) age and gender adjusted BMI ≥50th percentile and at least one
             parent with a body mass index (BMI) ≥25.

          -  One of the following race/ethnicities: Hispanic/Latino, African American, American
             Indian, or White.

          -  Speak English or Spanish.

        Exclusion Criteria. The exclusionary criteria used to select participants includes:

          -  Children with special dietary, physical, or behavioral needs.

          -  Non-custodial parents.
