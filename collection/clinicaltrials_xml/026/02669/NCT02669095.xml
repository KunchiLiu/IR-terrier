      This study is a multi-site, 5-visit dispensing, bilateral double-arm parallel group design,
      double-masked clinical trial using an investigational contact lens and a marketed contact
      lens. The objective is to evaluate comfort of the contact lenses when worn on a daily wear
      modality.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be between 18 to 40 years of age at the time of consent.

          -  The subject's vertexed spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range
             of +8.00 to -12.00 in each eye.

          -  Subject wears habitual contact lenses a minimum of 4 days per week, eight hours per
             day.

          -  The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye.

          -  The subject must be a habitual frequent replacement daily wear spherical silicone
             hydrogel soft contact lens wearer in both eyes.

          -  The subject must be able to wear contact lenses for a minimum of 8 hours each day
             during the study.

          -  The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will
             be discontinued).

          -  Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          -  Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          -  Any known sensitive/allergic to Ingredients of OPTI-FREE® PureMoist® solution.

          -  Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion.

          -  Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
             photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK),
             etc.).

          -  Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Any ocular infection.

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          -  Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 7 days
             prior to study enrollment.
