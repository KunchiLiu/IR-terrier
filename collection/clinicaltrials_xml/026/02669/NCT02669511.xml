      An open-label, non-randomized, two-stage, multicenter study evaluating clinical efficacy,
      safety, and pharmacokinetics effects of PQR309 in patients with relapsed or refractory
      PCNSL.

      The first stage of the study will enroll a minimum of 12 patients with relapsed or
      refractory PCNSL evaluable for the primary study objective. Following the completion of
      recruitment of patients in the first stage of the study, the decision will be made by the
      study team based on the continuous evaluation of safety and efficacy data, whether to
      continue recruitment of patients in the second stage while awaiting the data analyses ( Nine
      (9) additional patients will be enrolled for the second stage of the study, for a minimum of
      21 patients in total, evaluable for the final primary endpoint analysis.
