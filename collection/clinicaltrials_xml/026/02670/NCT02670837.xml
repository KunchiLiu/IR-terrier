  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few but persistent wounds often remain even after successful hematopoietic cell
      transplantation for systemic genodermatosis epidermolysis bullosa (EB). The investigators
      propose local wound therapy using epidermal skin grafting from the same donor that provided
      the hematopoietic graft, or from the same EB individual with a mosaic (naturally gene
      corrected) skin. In both cases permissive immune system and skin chimerism is expected to
      enable long-term epidermal engraftment and wound healing. The investigators will use FDA
      approved vacuum device (CelluTome®, Regulation number 878.4820) that enables painless,
      bloodless and scar-free harvesting of epidermis and its transfer on a square of surgical
      tape (Tegaderm®) to the recipient as a wound dressing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient (Recipient)

          -  Diagnosis of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB) or Junctional Epidermolysis
             Bullosa (JEB) with two or more areas of blistering each of which are at least 10
             cm^2, visibly free from infection and meets the eligibility for Arm A or Arm B based
             on the skin graft source:

          -  Cell harvest from previous hematopoietic cell transplantation donor (Arm A) - not
             applicable if Arm B

               -  At least 1 year after hematopoietic cell transplantation with hematopoietic
                  donor chimerism

                    -  Minimum acceptable donor chimerism is ≥5% without intervention in the prior
                       6 months (e.g., manipulation of immune suppressive therapy, use of donor
                       lymphocytes or infusion of hematopoietic stem cells).

               -  No history of pre-BMT autoimmune cytopenias

               -  Off immune suppressive therapy

               -  Original transplant donor is available and willing to be the epidermis donor

          -  Self-donation (Arm B) - not applicable if Arm A

               -  Proven somatic reversion by clinical exam and immune fluorescence (antigen
                  mapping)

               -  Site for skin grafting free of cellulitis and any other clinically evident
                  abnormalities

               -  Meets donor eligibility

          -  Insurance pre-authorization for procedure

          -  Voluntary written consent (patient or parent/guardian for minors with assent) prior
             to any research related procedures or treatment.

        Skin Graft Donor (either hematopoietic cell transplantation donor for the EB patient [Arm
        A] or EB patient herself/himself [Arm B])

          -  Age &gt; 2 years (based on prior safety testing of the device)

          -  Healthy on physical examination in the opinion of the evaluating provider

          -  Known negativity for Hepatitis B and C, HIV, and HTLV1/2

          -  Voluntary written consent (donor or parent/guardian for minors with assent) prior to
