    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of a
      traditional home exercise program versus an kinetic chain home exercise program on treatment
      outcome of overhead athletes with shoulder impingement syndrome. Primary outcome measures
      are reduction of pain and disability, and improvement in functionality and sports
      performance. Secondary outcome measures are strength, mobility, flexibility and functional
      performance.

    <measure>Changes in Shoulder Pain And Disability Index (SPADI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and within one week after the 6-weeks training program</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will fill in the SPADI questionnaire to evaluate shoulder pain and function. This questionnaire is a self-administered, shoulder-specific index consisting of 13 items, divided into two subscales, pain and function with responses to each item scored on a 10-point scale.</description>

    <measure>Subjective perception of shoulder improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>6-weeks training program</time_frame>
    <description>Patients rated their subjective perception of improvement of their shoulder pain as ''improved,'' ''not changed'' or ''worse.'' If they selected ''improved'' or ''worse,'' the amount of change was scored on a 5-point scale (very little change, little change, some change, a large change, a very large change)</description>

    <measure>Changes in shoulder, hip and scapular mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and within one week after the 6-weeks training program</time_frame>
    <description>Device: digital inclinometer (ACUMAR digital inclinometer, ACU, 360°; Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, IN) 2 trials will be recorded for each movement direction and for both sides:
Shoulder: external and internal rotation
Hip: external and internal rotation
Scapula: scapular upward rotation at 0°, 90° en 120° of elevation in the scapular plane.</description>

    <measure>Changes in scapular dyskinesis</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and within one week after the 6-weeks training program</time_frame>
    <description>Scapular dyskinesis will be measured by observing the scapular movement during active elevation. For both sides (left and right), scapular dyskinesis was evaluated as being present or not. In case dyskinesis was present, the amount of dyskinesis is scored as subtle or prominent.</description>

    <measure>Changes in pectoralis minor resting length</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and within one week after the 6-weeks training program</time_frame>
    <description>The length of the pectoralis minor will be determined by measuring the distance between 2 reference points using a digital caliper.</description>

Seated medicine ball trow
Y balance test for upper limb
Y balance test for lower limb
A throwing related fatigue test
