  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has EBV-mediated oncogenic signaling pathway
      activation, and these multiple intracellular pathway can be potential therapeutic target in
      this disorder. Thus, EBV-associated protein, LMP1 can induce the activation of various
      downstream pathway molecules such as PI3K/Akt and NF-kB activation. The activation of NF-kB
      is one of essential factors contributing to prolonged survival and aggressive phenotype of
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In a more aggressive subtype of diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma, activated B-cell like type, chronic active B-cell receptor signaling and MYD88
      mutation are known to stimulate NF-kB transcription and activation. As a result, a key
      molecule mediating B-cell receptor signaling pathway, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) can have
      a critical role, and BTK has been emerging as a therapeutic target in diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma. Considering the close association between B-cell receptor signaling pathway and
      PI3K/Akt pathway in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, targeting BTK might be helpful for
      improving treatment outcome of EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      Ibrutinib, BTK inhibitor has an activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma via targeting
      on B-cell receptor signaling pathway. As a result, the evidence of antitumor- effect of
      Ibrutinib has been accumulated in several types of B-cell lymphoma such as mantle cell
      lymphoma. Given EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is known as having poor response
      to treatment compared to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), the
      addition of ibrutinib to standard chemotherapy regimen, rituximab-CHOP may provide benefit
      these patients.
