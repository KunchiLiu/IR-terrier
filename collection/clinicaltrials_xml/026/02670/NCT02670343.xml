    <textblock>
      An open-label, single oral TU dose study was conducted in eight (8) hypogonadal men at a
      single study site. Each study participant received a single oral TU dose immediately prior
      to a standardized breakfast meal comprised of 800 to 1000 calories and approximately 30 g of
      fat. Blood samples were collected 30 minutes prior dose administration and at 0 pre-dose and
      post dose at the following hours post-dose; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 hours.

      This open-label, single oral dose, phlebotomy study was designed to clarify the issue of the
      influence of blood collection tubes on T, DHT, TU and DHTU measurements by collecting blood
      samples into various collection tubes from a small number of hypogonadal men dosed with a
      single oral TU dose in the form of a SEDDS formulation.
