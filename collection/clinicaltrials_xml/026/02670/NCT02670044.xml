      The primary objective for this study is to assess the safety and tolerability as well as
      preliminary efficacy of venetoclax in combination with cobimetinib, and venetoclax in
      combination with idasanutlin in patients &gt;/= 60 years of age with relapsed or refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia (R/R) AML who are not eligible for cytotoxic therapy.
