    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional, observational single arm study.

      Two-hundred patients will be recruited in the Netherlands over a one year period. In all
      cases, the decision to treat the patient with apremilast will be made prior to the decision
      to enter the subject into this study. Treatment will be according to routine clinical
      practice and based on recommendations as per the SPC of apremilast (Otezla®). Recruitment
      will continue until 200 patients have entered the study. Each patient will be followed for
      12 months.

      Baseline Demographics, disease characteristics and medication history prior to start of
      treatment with apremilast will be collected. Patients will be asked to complete baseline
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Short Form 36 (SF36), EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ5D),
      Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) and Work Productivity and
      Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaires. Photographs of the finger nails will be taken.

      Follow-up visits Follow-up assessments will take place at the regularly scheduled outpatient
      visits at 6 and 12 months (+/- 1 month) after initiation of apremilast.

        -  Skin-specific disease measures (Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI), (static)
           Physician Global Assessment (sPGA), Body Surface Area (BSA))

        -  Patients will be asked to complete the following questionnaires:

        -  DLQI

        -  TSQM

        -  EQ5D

        -  SF36- Itch Visual Analog Scale (VAS)

      End of treatment Upon discontinuation of treatment with apremilast, the date, the dose and
      reason for discontinuation will be documented.

      AE monitoring All patients will be monitored for adverse events throughout the study.

      From the time of the patient signing informed consent until treatment with apremilast is
      permanently abrogated, all non-serious adverse events that are considered related to
      apremilast and all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) regardless of causality will be reported.
