      Ongoing safety assessment follow up to Protocol MSB-GVHD 001 of remestemcel-L treatment in
      pediatric subjects with acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGVHD), following allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), that have failed to respond to treatment with
      systemic corticosteroid therapy.

      This is a safety follow-up study through 180 days of remestemcel-L treatment in subjects who
      participated in MSB-GVHD001. This study will also explore duration of response over time.
      Subjects who participated in MSB-GVHD001 and received at least one dose of remestemcel-L as
      outlined in that protocol will be evaluated at baseline (Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160
      and 180 for safety endpoints. Subjects who participated in Protocol MSB-GVHD001 and received
      the first 8 doses of remestemcel-L as outlined in that protocol will be evaluated at
      baseline (Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160 and 180.

             remestemcel L

          -  Subject or subject's authorized representative must be capable of providing written
             informed consent. Assent, if applicable, must also be collected when required by the

             contraception include abstinence, barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine device
             (IUD), or steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) in

          -  The subject must be willing and able to comply with study procedures, remain at the
             clinic as required during the study period, and return to the clinic for the
             follow-up evaluation as specified in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigator believes it to be in the best interest of the subject not to
