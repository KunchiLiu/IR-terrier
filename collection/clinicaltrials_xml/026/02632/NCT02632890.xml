    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine a) if the implementation of abatacept (Orencia®)
      patient alert card (PAC) resulted in effective understanding of key safety messages and b)
      if the degree of understanding of key safety messages is associated with improved clinical
      and safety outcomes.
