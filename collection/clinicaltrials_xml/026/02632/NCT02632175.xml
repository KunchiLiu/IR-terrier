  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects who achieve clinical response as measured by Partial Mayo Score (PMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a decrease in PMS equal to or greater than 2 points and equal to or greater than 30% from Study M11-290 Baseline</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Proportion of subjects who achieve Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>PUCAI remission is defined as a score less than 10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission as measured by PMS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a PMS less than or equal to 2 and no individual sub score greater 1</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects who achieve PUCAI response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>PUCAI response is defined as a decrease in PUCAI greater than or equal to Up to 20 points from Study M11-290 Baseline</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessing impact on children who have inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) using IMPACT III questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 35 item, self-administered questionnaire, with total score ranging from 35 (poor) to 175 (best). The questions are about the quality of the child's life with inflammatory bowel disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessing activity impairment using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Ulcerative Colitis (WPAI: UC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the impact of your child's UC on the parent/guardian's ability to work and perform regular activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects who achieve remission/response based on Full Mayo score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Full Mayo score will be based on subjects with available Full Mayo score data. Full Mayo score is a composite of 4 subscores. Each subscore is a number from 0 (lowest) to 3 (highest) with a total score of 0-12. Clinical remission per Full Mayo Score is defined as a Full Mayo Score less than or equal to 2 and no individual subscore greater than 1. Clinical response per Full Mayo Score defined as a decrease in Full Mayo Score greater than or equal to 3 points and greater than or equal to 3 points 30% from Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Mucosal Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Up through Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Mucosal Healing is defined as an endoscopy subscore of either 0 or 1.</description>
