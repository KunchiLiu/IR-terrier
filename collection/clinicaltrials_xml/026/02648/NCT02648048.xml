        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of IPF 5 years from time of screening, confirmed at baseline

          -  Tolerated dose of pirfenidone 1602-2403 mg once daily (QD) for a minimum of 24 weeks
             required prior to and during screening

          -  Greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percent (%) and &lt;=100% of predicted forced vital
             capacity (FVC) at screening

          -  Stable baseline lung function as evidenced by a difference of less than (&lt;) 10% in
             absolute FVC measurements (in liters) between screening and Day 1/Visit 2 prior to
             enrollment

          -  &gt;=30% and &lt;=90% of predicted diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide at
             screening

          -  Agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception

          -  Male participants must agree not to donate semen during the study and for at least 2
             months (or as per local requirements) after the last dose of vismodegib

          -  Agree not to donate blood or blood products during the study and for at least 9
             months (or as per local requirements) after the last dose of study treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant medical disease (other than IPF) that is associated with
             an expected survival of &lt;6 months, likely to require a change in therapy during the
             study

          -  Class IV New York Heart Association chronic heart failure or historical evidence of
