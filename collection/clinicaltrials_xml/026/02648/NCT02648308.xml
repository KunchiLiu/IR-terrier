      Results from the 5As Team (5AsT) Study have identified critical gaps in medical school
      curricula on obesity, leading to a wave of new family physicians who are unconfident and
      poorly equipped to manage obesity with their patients. In an effort to address this gap, all
      first year medical residents training in family medicine at the University of Alberta during
      the 2015/2016 year will be required to take a 2 day workshop in Obesity Management as part
      of the Doctor-Patient Relationship Course. The workshop will focus on knowledge, intangible
      skills and practicing the 5AsT approach to obesity management with patients of all
      demographics. The objective of the 5AsT MD2 study is to evaluate the impact of this workshop
      on the residents' attitudes and beliefs about obesity, as well as their level of confidence
      in using key aspects of the 5As of obesity management to help their patients. Participants
      will be asked to complete and submit pre- and post- knowledge assessments, narrative
      reflections and questionnaires assessing their beliefs and attitudes towards people living
      with obesity as part of their core requirements for the course. For those who consent to
      participate in the study and release their de-identified course assignments, we will
      evaluate the impact of the workshop using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The
      results will assist us in gaining information that may help us improve and further refine
      curricular materials for physicians and medical trainees.

      Background:

      Obesity is a complex chronic condition that negatively impacts individuals, society, and the
      healthcare system. Family physicians are one of many health practitioners tasked with the
      long-term care of patients with obesity and its associated co-morbidities. However, focus
      groups conducted by the 5As Team (5AsT) have identified critical gaps in medical school
      curricula on obesity, leading to a wave of new family physicians who are unconfident and
      poorly equipped to manage obesity with their patients. To address this education gap, the
      5As team developed a comprehensive training module on obesity management for family medicine
      residents at the University of Alberta.

      Study Objectives:

      This study aims to evaluate the impact of this module on the residents' attitudes and
      beliefs about obesity, as well as their level of confidence in using key aspects of the 5As
      of obesity management to help their patients.

      Methods:

      Based on focus groups conducted with medical students and practicing physicians during a
      summer project last year, a list of learning objectives was made to address known
      deficiencies in obesity education. These learning objectives were adapted to a two-day
      training module on obesity management for first year family medicine residents. All
      2015/2016 first year medical residents are required to take a 2 day Obesity Management
      Workshop as part of their Doctor-Patient Relationship course. The first day consists of a
      lecture on weight bias and an opportunity to experience using a bariatric suit in a
      simulated living environment. The second day consists of a patient presentation, an
      introduction to the 5As of obesity management, interactive group discussions, and
      standardized patient interviews. Existing materials from the 5AsT intervention and Canadian
      Obesity Network were used to develop knowledge assessments, educational readings, narrative
      reflective assignments, and four standardized patient cases. These materials are to be used
      for the module, which will span an expected 62 family medicine residents at the University
      of Alberta.

      Consent:

      Residents will be informed about the 5AsT MD2 study on the first day of the 2-day workshop
      and asked if they would like to participate. If a resident declines to participate, they
      will still be able to take part in the workshop and will still be required to complete the
      course materials listed above, however, their course materials will not provided to the
      research team.

      Study Procedures:

      Those residents who have consented to participate in the study, will be asked to place their
      required course materials into a sealed envelope and will then submit them to a neutral,
      third party. The neutral, third party is an employee in the Department of Family Medicine
      and has no responsibilities with regards to evaluation of the medical residents. The
      neutral, third party will record that the resident has completed their assignment for the
      course, assign an Identification (ID) number to each resident and label each document as
      well as the envelope with the resident's ID number. Using a paper cutter, the neutral, third
      party will then remove the resident's name from each document. A master list will be kept by
      the neutral, third party, which will allow her to track which ID number corresponds to which
      resident so that she can appropriately label all of the post-workshop documents with the
      resident's assigned ID number. Only the neutral, third party will have access to the master
      last with the residents names.

      Following the workshop on the second day, the residents who have consented to participate,
      will, once again, submit their post-workshop course materials, in a sealed envelope, to the
      neutral third party. The neutral, third party will once again record that the resident
      completed their assignment for the course, label their documents and envelope with the
      correct ID number and then remove the resident's name from the documents. The de-identified
      materials of those residents who have consented to participate will then be given to study
      staff. The narrative reflective exercises for both part 1 and part 2 of the workshop are due
      2 weeks post-workshop event. NB The Timing for data collection is at the beginning of the
      first day of the workshop and at the end of the second day of the workshop.

      Results:

      Participants will complete validated ATOP (Attitudes Toward Obese Persons) and BAOP (Beliefs
      About Obese Persons) questionnaires, as well as knowledge assessment questionnaires to
      measure their level of confidence in performing key aspects of obesity management. All
      questionnaires will de-identified, but responses will be tracked both before and after the
      training module to quantify the change seen in each study participant. Participants will
      also write two de-identified narrative reflections to be used for qualitative analysis. The
      first is on the weight bias bariatric suit experience, and the second is on the application
      of the lessons of the workshop in clinical practice.
