  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood management is an important part of successful total joint replacement. Loss of blood
      and transfusion can lead to poor outcomes for patients. The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) has
      become a standard component to many blood management programs. It is used to treat or
      prevent excessive blood loss during surgery and in various medical conditions such as
      excessive bleeding or hemorrhage. A normal body process prevents blood clots that occur
      naturally from growing and causing problems. When this process becomes overactive it can
      result in excessive bleeding, leading to increased blood transfusions. The proposed study
      seeks to evaluate the relationship between TXA and thromboelastogram (TEG) results.
