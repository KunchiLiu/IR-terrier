  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label,partially randomized, four-period study in healthy male subjects to
      assess the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of AZD7594 when
      administered intravenously, orally and inhaled via two different dry powder inhalers (DPIs)
      and a pressurized meter-dose inhaler (pMDI)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, partially randomized, 4-period, 5-treatment study in healthy
      male subjects, performed at a single study center. All subjects will receive the 4 of the 5
      treatments. The IV infusion will be fixed as the first treatment (Period 1), the Monodose
      inhaler will be fixed as the second treatment (Period 2) and the oral formulation will be
      fixed as the fourth treatment (Period 4). During Period 3, subjects are split into 2 equal
      cohorts, multiple-dose DPI and pMDI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation in
             the study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate in the
             study.

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease, or any other

             within 4 weeks of the first administration of Investigational medicinal product
             (IMP).

          4. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology, or
             urinalysis results at screening and check-in, as judged by the investigator.

               -  Diastolic BP &gt; 90 mm Hg;

               -  Diastolic BP &lt; 60 mm Hg; or

               -  Heart rate &lt; 40 or &gt; 85 beats per minute (bpm).

          6. Any clinically significant abnormities in physical examination or lung function, as
             judged by the investigator.

          7. Any clinically significant abnormalities on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at
             screening and check-in, as judged by the investigator.

          8. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting
             ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc (QT interval corrected)
             interval changes. This includes subjects with any of the following:

               -  Clinically significant PR (PQ) (ECG interval measured from the onset of the P
                  wave to the onset of the QRS complex) interval prolongation;

               -  Intermittent or persistent second or third degree AV block;

               -  Persistent or intermittent complete bundle branch block (BBB), incomplete bundle
                  branch block (IBBB), or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) with QRS (ECG
                  interval measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the J point) &gt; 110 ms.
                  Subjects with QRS &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 115 ms are acceptable if there is no evidence
                  of, for example, ventricular hypertrophy or pre-excitation; or

               -  Abnormal T wave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead.

             450 msec or family history of long QT (ECG interval measured from the onset of the
             QRS complex to the end of the T wave) syndrome.

         10. Known or suspected history of drug abuse, as judged by the investigator

         11. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the
             previous 3 months.

         17. Use of any prescribed or non-prescribed medication including vaccines, antacids,
             analgesics (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, vitamins and
             minerals during the 2 weeks prior to the first administration of IMP or longer if the
             medication has a long half-life. Occasional use of paracetamol/acetaminophen is
             allowed for minor pains and headaches (no more than 3000 mg/day).

         18. Plasma donation within 1 month of screening or any blood donation/loss more than 500
             mL during the 3 months prior to screening.

             product.

         20. Known Gilbert's syndrome, family history of Gilbert's syndrome or suspicion of
             Gilbert's syndrome based on liver function tests.

         23. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
             hepatitis C antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

         24. Judgment by the investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
             unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.

         25. Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship,
             trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.
