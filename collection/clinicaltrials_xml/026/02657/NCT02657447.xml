      This study is a phase I, open label, randomized study to assess pharmacokinetics,
      biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of 177Lu-DOTA-HH1 (Betalutin®) radioimmunotherapy in
      patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The study will also investigate the safety,
      toxicity and efficacy of Betalutin and pre-dosing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed (by WHO classification) relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin B-cell
             lymphoma of following subtypes: Follicular lymphoma (follicular grade I-IIIA),
             Marginal zone lymphoma (exclusion of MZL if large lymphocytes &gt; 50%), Small
             lymphocytic lymphoma, Lymphoplasmacytoid and classical mantle cell lymphoma (no
             blastoid MCL).

          2. Requiring initiation of treatment for the NHL.

          3. Relapsed after at least one line of therapy including rituximab combination
             chemotherapy regimen.

          4. Exhausted and/or ineligible for all standard treatment options.

          5. Not a candidate for an autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients
             in progression after successful stem cell collection before before high-dose therapy
             and autologous stem cell transplantation may be considered for enrolment.

          6. Age ≥ 18 years..

          7. A pre-study ECOG performance status of 0-2. In selected patients an ECOG score of 3
             can be acceptable if it is clearly lymphoma-associated at the discretion of the
             investigator.

          8. Life expectancy should be ≥ 3 months.

          9. &lt;25% tumour cells in bone marrow biopsy prior to HH1/Betalutin treatment. At
             screening patients with higher levels may be included, provided patient agrees to
             have a new bone marrow biopsy prior to HH1/Betalutin treatment . If amount of tumour
             cells is still above 25% after rituximab pre-treatment, the patient will need to be
             excluded from the study prior to HH1 infusion and Betalutin administration.

         10. All patients must have at least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (&gt;1.5 cm in
             its largest dimension by CT scan). Patients without such a target lesion can be
             accepted on an individual basis if histological organ involvement can be evaluated
             for response e.g. involvement of the skin or the gastrointestinal tract.

         11. Women of childbearing potential must:

               -  have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and before Betalutin injection

               -  understand that the study medication is expected to have teratogenic risk

               -  agree to use, and be able to comply with, highly effective method of birth
                  control with a Pearl-Index ≤ 1%. Contraception is required without interruption,
                  4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy and for 12
                  months after end of study drug therapy, even if she has amenorrhoea.

         12. Male subjects must agree to use condoms during intercourse throughout study drug
             therapy and the following 12 months.

         13. Patients previously treated with native rituximab are eligible.

         14. The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol, and agrees to return to
             the hospital for follow-up visits and examination.

         15. The patient has been fully informed about the study and has signed the informed
             consent form.

         16. Negative HAMA test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical contraindications, including uncontrolled infection, severe cardiac,
             pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric or metabolic disease, steroid requiring
             asthma/allergy, known HIV positive.

          2. Laboratory values during screening :

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC) ≤ 1.5 x 109 /l

               -  Platelet count ≤ 150 x 109 /l (platelet count at D-28 must not be more than 20%
                  lower than the result at screening)

               -  Total bilirubin ≥ 30 mmol/l

               -  ALP and ALAT ≥ 4x normal level e. GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 as measured by the
                  CKD-EPI method.

          3. Known or suspected CNS involvement of lymphoma

          4. Previous total body irradiation, or irradiation of &gt; 25% of the patient's bone
             marrow.

          5. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy or another investigational drug received within the last
             4 weeks prior to the patient entering screening.

          6. Earlier treatment with radioimmunotherapy.

          7. Exposure to another CD37 targeting drug.

          8. Concurrent participation in another therapeutic treatment trial.

          9. Previous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autologous and allogenic).

         10. Pregnant or lactating women.

         11. Transformed or potentially transformed NHL

         12. Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to enrolment

         13. Test positive for hepatitis B (HBsAg and anti-HBc)

         14. A known hypersensitivity to rituximab, HH1, Betalutin or murine proteins or any
             excipient used in rituximab, HH1 or Betalutin
