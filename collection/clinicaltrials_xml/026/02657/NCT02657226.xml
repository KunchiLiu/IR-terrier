    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the association between intensive monitoring of renal function
      (urine output, serum creatinine, and both) and outcomes among critically ill patients with
      and without Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive monitoring of renal function provides an early opportunity to modify or attenuate
      certain risk factors (e.g., nephrotoxin exposure) for AKI. Intensive monitoring of urine
      output (UO) provides a real-time continuous assessment of renal function in the ICU.
      However, the association between intensive monitoring and less-intensive monitoring of urine
      output, with or without close monitoring of serum creatinine (sCr), on susceptibility to AKI
      and outcomes from AKI are unknown. Our preliminary data indicates that intensive monitoring
      of UO is associated with lower hospital mortality as compared to less-intensive monitoring
      for patients that develop AKI. If intensive monitoring of renal function is associated with
      lower risk of AKI and improved outcomes from AKI, then such monitoring techniques could be
      widely used in hospitalized patients including non-intensive care settings to either prevent
      AKI or progression of AKI.

      Therefore, this observational retrospective cohort study aims to compare the outcomes of
      patients undergoing intensive monitoring of renal function (UO and/or sCr) with those of
      patients undergoing less intensive monitoring. Outcomes will include mortality within 30
      days of ICU admission among critically ill patients with and without AKI. Development of
      severe AKI within 7 days of ICU admission and fluid overload on any ICU day in patients who
      develop severe AKI (KDIGO stage 3) will also be assessed.

      This study will utilize a large, heterogeneous cohort (n=~65,800) of critically ill patients
      admitted to the ICU over a 12 year period at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
      The study population will consist of patients who receive intensive monitoring of UO
      (defined as measured at least every 2 hours within the first 48 hours of ICU admission) and
      strict creatinine measurement (defined as at least daily). Patients who fail to meet
      criteria for intensive monitoring will be controls (less-intensive monitoring group). AKI
      will be diagnosed according to the KDIGO stage 1-3 criteria over a 7-day period. Mortality
      at 30-days from ICU admission will be ascertained using the social security death master
      file. In order to account for indication bias, a propensity score for intensive monitoring
      will be built using various risk factors. Risk and severity of illness-adjusted estimates
      will be generated for susceptibility to AKI and mortality from AKI between intensive and
      less-intensive monitoring groups.
