      The primary objective of the study is to assess full-field visual evoked potential (FF-VEP)
      latency in subjects who were enrolled in Study 215ON201 (NCT01721161) 2 years (+ 4 months)
      after the last study visit. The secondary objective is to assess clinical progression and
      severity of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease in subjects who were enrolled
      in Study 215ON201 2 years (+ 4 months) after the last study visit. No study drug dosing is
      planned for this study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in FF-VEP latency of the affected eye as compared to the baseline of the fellow eye at 2 years (+ 4 months) after the last study visit assessment (Week 32) in Study 215ON201.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>A full field visual evoked potential is an evoked potential caused by a visual stimulus, such as an alternating checkerboard pattern on a computer screen. Responses are recorded from electrodes that are placed on the back of the head and are observed as a reading on an electroencephalogram (EEG). These responses usually originate from the occipital cortex, the area of the brain involved in receiving and interpreting visual signals.</description>

    <measure>Severity of CNS demyelinating disease with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of CNS demyelinating disease with Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The SDMT involves a simple substitution task. Using a reference key, the examinee has 90 seconds to pair specific numbers with given geometric figures. Because examinees can give either written or spoken responses, the test is well suited for use with individuals who have motor disabilities or speech disorders. Because it involves only geometric figures and numbers, the SDMT is relatively culture free as well and can be administered to individuals who do not speak English.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of CNS demyelinating disease with multiple sclerosis functional composite (MSFC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The MSFC is a three-part, standardized, quantitative, assessment instrument for use in clinical studies, particularly clinical trials, of MS. The three components of the MSFC are: (1) measure leg function/ambulation, (2) measure arm/hand function, and (3) measure cognitive function.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have participated in Study 215ON201 and received at least 1 dose of BIIB033 or
             placebo, as per protocol, within 2 years (+ 4 months) from Day 1 of this study (2
             years from Week 32 or projected Week 32 visit, if the subject did not complete all
             visits in Study 215ON201).

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not previously enrolled in Study 215ON201

          -  Subjects with recent kidney function, such as serum creatinine above upper limit of
             normal range, will not be allowed to receive administration of Gd but will otherwise
             be allowed to participate in the study, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             assessments not requiring the use of Gd.

          -  Female subjects must have had a recent pregnancy test and must not be breastfeeding
             prior to MRI assessments with Gd.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
