      It will be done a randomized triple-blind study comparing 0,2% polidocanol versus 75%
      hypertonic glucose of sclerotherapy in lower limbs´ telangiectasis. It will be included only
      adult women with reticular veins on the side of the thighs and mild venous insufficiency
      (CEAP 1). The primary endpoint will be efficacy, and secondary will be safety.

      Background. The prevalence of chronic venous disease is high in the general population,
      mainly in young women, and in milder cases the usual complaint is aesthetic. Various
      techniques are used for treatment of mild varicose disease, including surgical treatment,
      laser ablation and sclerotherapy. Telangiectasis are those with less than 1 mm diameter,
      reddish and important contribution to the aesthetic damage, and sometimes they are related
      to local pain. There is no consensus in the literature about the effectiveness of treatment
      with sclerotherapy, despite of being an usual procedure with different chemicals.

      Methods and design. One hundred lower limbs of healthy women between 18 and 65 years will be
      triple blind randomized to receive treatment with polidocanol 0.2% diluted in 70% hypertonic
      glucose versus 75% hypertonic glucose for sclerotherapy treatment of telangiectasis. The
      patients will be examined and clinically classified. It will be included patients with
      telangiectasis sited at out's thigh, and only one extremity will be included per patient.
      The patients with varicose disease CEAP 2 or more will not be included. The treatment will
      be carried out in only one session and the medication volume not exceeding 5 ml. Clinical
      follow-up protocols will be filled on regular visits on days 0 - 7 - 60 concomitantly with
      photograph documentation. Supplementary examination for venous mapping with ultrasound
      pretreatment is performed for all patients.

      Discussion. This prospective controlled double-blind randomized trial aims to verify and
      compare the efficacy and safety for sclerotherapy treatment of telangiectasis of the lower
      limbs. The results may help physicians to choose the best sclerotherapy treatment for
      telangiectasis.
