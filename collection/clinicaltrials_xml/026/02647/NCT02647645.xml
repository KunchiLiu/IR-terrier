    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop pilot data on the potential efficacy of
      computer-based cognitive training or the combination of computer-based cognitive training
      with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in improving cognitive function in
      persons with HIV-related mild neurocognitive disorder (MND). tDCS is a noninvasive brain
      stimulation technique in which a small direct current (1-2 mA) is applied to the scalp
      during a cognitive or motor activity, inducing a very small current that affects specific
      neural circuits related to the site at which electrodes are placed. tDCS has been judged
      safe and has shown significant treatment effects in studies with other populations, but has
      not been extensively studied in individuals with HIV infection. tDCS has been shown to
      facilitate learning in a number of studies, suggesting that it may improve or enhance
      learning in those with cognitive problems. As HIV infection is associated with decrements in
      a number of cognitive skills, including working memory, executive functions, and psychomotor
      speed that are related to individuals' functional status and medication adherence, the
      demonstration of a technique to enhance the effects of cognitive training in this population
      would have substantial clinical benefits as well as scientific value.
