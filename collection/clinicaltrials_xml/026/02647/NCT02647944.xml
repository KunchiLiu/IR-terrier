  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with differences in stomach function, feeling of fullness after meals,
      and total calories consumed at a buffet meal. Based upon previous research, our study
      hypothesis is that weight loss with pharmacological agents may be individualized, based on
      the abnormality in those gastrointestinal functions. These studies will provide support for
      the principle that specific obesity medications should be selected according to individual
      characteristics, and it is anticipated that this approach will enhance efficacy of
      medication treatment of obesity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Overweight and obese adults (≥30 kg/m2 or ≥27 kg/m2 with an obesity-related
             co-morbidity).

          -  Subjects will reside within 125 miles of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

          -  Healthy individuals with no unstable psychiatric disease and not currently on
             treatment for cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, hematological,
             neurological, or endocrine (other than hyperglycemia type 2 diabetes mellitus on
             metformin) disorders.

          -  Women of childbearing potential will be using an effective form of contraception, and
             have negative pregnancy tests within 48 hours of enrolment and before each radiation
             exposure.

          -  Subjects must have the ability to provide informed consent before any trial-related
             activities.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Weight exceeding 137 kilograms (safety limit of camera for measuring gastric
             volumes).

          -  Abdominal surgery other than appendectomy, Caesarian section or tubal ligation.

          -  Positive history of chronic gastrointestinal diseases, systemic disease that could
             affect gastrointestinal motility, or use of medications that may alter
             gastrointestinal motility, appetite or absorption, e.g., orlistat.

          -  Patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or Multiple
             Endocrine Neoplasia-type 2.

          -  Patients with a personal history of pancreatitis (acute or chronic)

          -  Significant untreated psychiatric dysfunction based upon screening with the Hospital
             Anxiety and Depression Inventory, a self-administered alcoholism screening test
             (AUDIT-C), and the Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns (binge eating
             disorders and bulimia). If such a dysfunction is identified by a Hospital Anxiety
             Depression (HAD) score &gt;8 or difficulties with substance or eating disorders, the
             participant will be excluded and given a referral letter to his/her primary care
             doctor for further appraisal and follow-up.

          -  Intake of medication, whether prescribed or over the counter (except multivitamins),
             within 7 days of the study. Exceptions are birth control pill, estrogen replacement
             therapy, thyroxin replacement therapy and any medication administered for
             co-morbidities as long as they do not alter gastrointestinal motility including
             gastric emptying (GE) and gastric accommodation. For example, statins for
             hyperlipidemia, diuretics, β-adrenergic blockers,Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)
             inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists for hypertension, and metformin for type 2
             diabetes mellitus or prediabetes are permissible. In contrast, resin sequestrants for
             hyperlipidemia [which may reduce GE and reduce appetite, α2-adrenergic agonists for
             hypertension, or other GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide) or amylin analogs
             (pramlintide) are not permissible because they significantly affect GE and/or gastric
             accommodation.

          -  Hypersensitivity to the study medication, liraglutide.
