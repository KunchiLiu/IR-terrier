  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will test the hypothesis that the administration of CF101, a novel
      anti-inflammatory agent, to patients with rheumatoid arthritis will relieve signs and
      symptoms of the disease. CF101 effect will be in comparison to MTX in this study population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study in subjects with clinically active RA but who are MTX-na√Øve. Subjects who meet
      enrollment criteria will be randomized to 1 of 4 groups in a 2:2:2:1 ratio: CF101 1 mg,
      CF101 2 mg, MTX, or matching placebo tablets. CF101 or matching placebo will be administered
      every 12 hours for up to 24 weeks on treatment. MTX or matching placebo will be administered
      once a week Screening examinations will occur within 6 weeks prior to dosing. The following
      conventional drugs for RA treatment must be stable for the respective designated periods
      prior to the Screening Visit and must remain so during protocol participation: nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), and corticosteroids for &gt;1 month. All subjects will
      receive oral folate (minimum dose 5 mg/week) or oral folinic acid (up to 10 mg/week), based
      on the Investigator's preference.

      Disease activity will be assessed using swollen and tender joint counts, erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR), and CRP. Efficacy will be assessed by Disease Activity Score 28
      using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), ACR response criteria and European
      League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria : swollen and tender joint counts,
      physician global assessment (by visual analog scale, patient global assessment , patient
      reported pain, a Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index (DI) , Westergren
      ESR levels, and CRP levels. Assessments will occur at Screening, Baseline (Week 0), and
      Weeks 4, 8, 12 16, 20, and 24. At Weeks 12, 16, and 20, any subject who has not experienced
      at least 20% improvement in both the number of swollen and number of tender joints will be
      given rescue therapy with open-label oral MTX and followed through Week 24.

      PK will be assessed in a subgroup of approximately 100 subjects at Week 0, Week 8, and Week
      12. All subjects in the PK cohort will have samples collected for PK at time 0, and each
      subject will have additional samples drawn at 2 of the following post-dose time points: 1,
      2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours. Whole blood sample for A3AR expression will be assessed in
      approximately 100 subjects at selected sites at Screening and Week 12, or end of dosing, if
      occurring before Week 12.
