    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this Phase 2, 12-week study, is that DS-8500a will improve glycemic
      control relative to placebo, based on changes in HbA1c, with acceptable safety and
      tolerability, in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) who are treated with
      metformin.
