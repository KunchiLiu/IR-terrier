      The purpose of this study is to assess the value of circulating tumor cells (CTC)for
      non-small cell lung cancer in the postoperative recurrence monitoring by comparing the CTCs,
      CT and tumor markers at different time points.The time of CTC and carcinoembryonic
      antigen(CEA) detection is baseline, 2~7 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36
      months after the surgery. And the time of CT detection is 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36
      months after the surgery.
