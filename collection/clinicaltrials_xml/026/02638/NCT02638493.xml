    <textblock>
      Male participants taking tenofovir-emtrictabine (TDF/FTC) will provide semen and blood
      samples which will be analyzed to better understand the pharmacology of antiretroviral
      therapy in the male genital tract.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      8 HIV positive men taking TDF/FTC and 8 HIV negative men taking TDF/FTC as pre-exposure
      prophylaxis will provide multiple semen and blood samples during a 48-hour inpatient visit.
      8 HIV positive men taking TAF (tenofovir alafenamide) will provide multiple semen and blood
      samples during a 48-hour inpatient visit.

      Participants will take part in the study for approximately two months. After the screening
      visit, there is one 2 day overnight visit for intensive PK/PD
      (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) sampling. The investigators will study drug concentrations
      and intracellular endogenous nucleotide concentrations (dATP and dCTP) in seminal plasma and
      (where appropriate) seminal cells.

      Samples will be analyzed through the use of novel laboratory methods to determine the
      seminal plasma and seminal cell concentrations of tenofovir emtricitabine. New technologies
      will be used to better understand compartmental and intracellular antiretroviral
      pharmacology of nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Pharmacokinetic modeling
      will be used to estimate the primary outcomes.
