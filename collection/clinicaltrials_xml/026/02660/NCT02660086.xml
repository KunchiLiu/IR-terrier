  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project tests a scalable and sustainable approach to weight gain prevention in a
      population of employees by using the worksite environment to deliver personalized feedback
      about worksite food purchases, daily calorie goals, social norms for healthy eating, and
      financial incentives for healthy food purchases. In the future, similar strategies could be
      adopted by other worksites, institutions, and food retailers and could contribute to the
      long-term environmental and social changes needed to reverse the obesity epidemic in the
      United States and worldwide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults in the United States gain an average of 1-2 pounds a year. Interventions to prevent
      weight gain at the population level are needed to reverse the rising prevalence of obesity.
      Although individual-level interventions can result in large weight changes among small
      groups of individuals, achieving changes in the population will require long-term strategies
      that create healthier food environments, establish new social norms, and improve motivation
      and skills for healthy lifestyle behaviors. The worksite is ideal for interventions to
      address weight and lifestyle behaviors because a majority of adults are employed, and
      provisions in the Affordable Care Act encourage worksite wellness. Our research team at
      Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) has demonstrated that behavioral economics strategies,
      including traffic-light labels, choice architecture, social norms, and financial incentives,
      improve employees' healthy food choices. The proposed project will address the critical next
      phase of this research to determine if a worksite intervention delivered through the food
      environment can prevent weight gain and reduce cardiovascular risk of employees. This
      project builds on the established traffic-light labeling system at MGH and tests an
      intervention that aims to increase nutrition knowledge, motivate change in lifestyle
      behaviors, and promote socially normative behavior for healthier lifestyles among employees.
      The intervention will be integrated into the flow of the work day, thus lowering burden to
      employees and the employer. Study Design: In a randomized controlled trial, 600 MGH
      employees will be assigned to: 1) an intervention arm with automated, personalized feedback
      about (a) worksite food purchases and calorie and physical activity goals (weekly emails)
      and (b) social norm feedback plus small financial incentives for healthy food purchases
      (monthly letters) or 2) a control arm (standardized monthly letters). Study outcomes will be
      assessed at 1 year (end of intervention) and 2 year follow-up. The primary outcome is change
      in weight at 1 year. Secondary outcomes are cardiovascular risk factors, worksite food
      purchases, and dietary intake (as measured by the Healthy Eating Index). A novel exploratory
      outcome will be healthy food purchases of co-workers who are socially connected to study
      subjects. Aim 1 is to determine if employees assigned to the intervention have less weight
      gain and lower cardiovascular risk factors than the control group at 1 year and 2-year
      follow-up. Aim 2 is to determine if employees assigned to the intervention group make
      healthier food choices than the control group at 1 year and 2-year follow-up. Exploratory
      Aim 3 is to determine if employees socially connected to the intervention group make
      healthier worksite food choices over 1 year than employees connected to the control group.
      Implications: This innovative strategy utilizing personalized feedback, social norms, and
      financial incentives will provide a scalable and sustainable model that could be adopted in
      other worksite, institutional, and retail settings to prevent obesity at the population
      level.
