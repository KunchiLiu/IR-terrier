      This is a Phase 4, randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether addition of Vorapaxar 2.08
      mg daily vs. placebo daily on background antiplatelet therapy, prescribed for 6 months to
      patients with established peripheral artery disease (PAD) and Intermittent Claudication (IC)
      treated with standard medical therapy (SMT) would lead to an improvement in the peak walking
      time (PWT).

      Primary trial objective: To evaluate whether addition of Vorapaxar 2.08 mg daily vs. placebo
      daily on background antiplatelet therapy, prescribed for 6 months to patients with
      established PAD and IC treated with standard medical therapy (SMT) would lead to an
      improvement in the peak walking time (PWT)

      Study endpoints Primary endpoint: Change from baseline to 6 months in the PWT on a graded
      treadmill test (GTT per Gardner protocol) between participants enrolled in the test and
      control arms of the study

      Secondary endpoints

        -  Change from baseline to 6 months in the claudication onset time (COT) on GTT between
           participants enrolled in the test and control arms of the study.

        -  Change from baseline to 6 months in the walking impairment questionnaire distance
           scores (WIQ) between participants enrolled in the test and control arms of the study.

        -  Change from baseline to 6 months in self-reported quality of life score using the
           Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short form survey (SF-12) between participants enrolled
           in the test and control arms of the study

      Tertiary endpoints

        -  The first occurrence of clinically indicated lower extremity endovascular or surgical
           revascularization procedure during the entire study duration post-randomization in
           participants enrolled in the test or control arms of the study.

        -  The first occurrence of all-cause death, MI, ischemic stroke during the entire study
           duration post-randomization in participants enrolled in the test or control arms of the
           study.

        -  The first occurrence of severe bleeding defined according to the Global Utilization of
           Streptokinase and Tissue plasminogen activator for Occluded coronary arteries (GUSTO)
           classification during the entire study duration post-randomization in participants
           enrolled in the test or control arms of the study.
