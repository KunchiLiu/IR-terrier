  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Malaria is still a health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa. Death rates are stable and have
      even increased in some areas. There are malaria vaccines. However, researchers think
      repeated immunizations with a vaccine called PfSPZ may work better.

      Objective:

      To see if PfSPZ is safe, tolerable, and effective against malaria.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18 to 50 years who live in the Doneguebougou area in Mali

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.

      Participants will sign or fingerprint the consent form. They will take a survey to see how
      well they understand the study.

      Participants will give blood and urine samples.

      Participants will have at least one ECG: Soft electrodes will be stuck to the skin. A
      machine will record heart signals.

      Participants will have HIV counseling.

      Participants will be assigned to a group. Groups will get a different strength doses. Groups
      will get a different number of vaccines over different periods of time.

      If a participant develops a rash or injection site reaction, photographs may be taken.

      Participants will receive an oral anti-malaria drug during the study.

      Participants will be monitored for 3 to 6 months after the last vaccine.

    <textblock>
      It is known that humans can be protected against malaria by repeated immunization with
      radiation-attenuated sporozoites. Traditionally, those sporozoites are administered by
      exposing the vaccinee to at least 1000 bites of sporozoite-infected irradiated mosquitoes,
      an approach that is unsuitable for mass vaccination campaigns. Recently, Sanaria, Inc.
      developed a process for manufacturing, in compliance with current Good Manufacturing
      Practices (cGMPs) aseptic, purified, radiation attenuated cryopreserved sporozoites from a
      well-characterized isolate of P. falciparum. This product, which is called PfSPZ Vaccine,
      can be administered by needle and syringe. Previous studies conducted by the Vaccine
      Research Center and the Navy have established that IV administration of PfSPZ Vaccine can
      induce sterile protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with a
      homologous strain of P. falciparum in up to 100% of malaria na(SqrRoot) ve individuals. A
      recent study conducted as collaboration among the Malaria Research and Training Center
      (MRTC, Mali), the Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV) National Institute
      of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Sanaria, Inc. has shown that sterile
      protection against naturally occurring malaria infection can be achieved, but not at the
      level seen in the US nor at the level desired. The next logical step in an attempt to
      improve protective efficacy in the targeted endemic population is to increase the PfSPZ
      Vaccine dose, increasing the interval between the first and second doses to 8 weeks (as was
      done in WRAIR 2080 in the group receiving 3 doses of 4.5x105 PfSPZ), and reducing the
      numbers of doses to three. Additionally, in this study design, we also can begin to
      understand how the standard controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model may be used in
      the field and start to explore the impact of such factors as malaria co-infection and drug
      treatment have on vaccine responses. The initial dose escalation pilot study will focus on
      safety and tolerability of the PfSPZ Vaccine. A defined number of subjects enrolled during
      the pilot study will also undergo further evaluation, including randomization to receive or
      not receive drug treatment immediately prior to each vaccination and examination of
      protective efficacy against homologous CHMI via PfSPZ Challenge. The targeted dose (18x105
      PfSPZ Vaccine), if safe and tolerable, will be administered to a larger cohort in a double
      blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial to examine the protective efficacy of the
      vaccine against naturally occurring infection. Subjects will be recruited from rural
      villages in Mali. The study will be conducted as collaboration among MRTC, LMIV/NIAID, and
      Sanaria, Inc.
