    <textblock>
      This study intends to investigate patient satisfaction of treatment with Ointment (W/O
      emulsion) formulations of Potency Class II topical corticosteroids (TCs) for atopic
      dermatitis (AD) patients in Japan. Objectives include measuring patient satisfaction,
      treatment adherence, itchiness, and AD severity scores.

        Patients will be recruited by the investigator who will also be the treating physician. As
        an observational study, only patients who the investigator plans on switching to the
        ointment (W/O emulsion) from fatty ointment formulation will be eligible to participate.
        Patients will be recruited for each seasonal phase and same patients may not necessarily
        be observed between the two seasonal phases.
