    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics and therapeutic activity of RO6874281 in participants with advanced and/or
      metastatic solid tumors. Participants will be treated until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs, for up to a maximum of 24 months.
