  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing a study to learn how to support patients aged 60+ in taking more
      breaks from sitting and reducing total sitting time. The goal of the study is to find out if
      a sitting time reduction intervention reduces sitting time compared with a control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than one-third of American adults over 60 have a body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m2. These
      older adults have more sedentary time than any other group -- an average of 10-11 hours per
      day. Reducing the sedentary behavior of older adults with obesity, rather than only
      promoting more intensive physical activity, could provide a more feasible approach to health
      promotion.

      This randomized control pilot trial will evaluate a 12-week intervention to decrease sitting
      time and increase standing time and light physical activity among sedentary older adults a
      body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m2 as compared to control group. Baseline and 12-week measurements
      include anthropometric measures, blood draw by finger stick, cardiovascular health
      assessments, physical function tasks, and a survey. The intervention will consist of two
      in-person visits with a health coach followed by phone-based coaching.

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to the I-STAND intervention group will receive 2 in-person health coaching sessions and 4 biweekly phone-based health coaching sessions. They will receive a wristband that gives a mild vibration after 20 minutes of inactivity and will be encouraged to stand if possible after each inactivity alert. Participants may also choose to receive biweekly email reminders in the weeks between coaching calls. They will also receive a workbook with content around reducing sitting time.</description>

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to the Healthy Living enhanced usual care control group will receive 1 in-person health coaching session and 5 biweekly check-in letters by mail. They will receive a workbook with general healthy living topics that are not expected to impact sitting time. All content is taken from Group Health Cooperative's website and is available to all members. Participants will select topics of interest and review them on their own with no further health coaching.</description>
