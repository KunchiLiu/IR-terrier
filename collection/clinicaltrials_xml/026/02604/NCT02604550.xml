      The objective of this study is to compare the pain control benefit of two different types of
      nerve blocks in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, randomized, surgeon-blinded, two-armed trial to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of femoral nerve blocks versus adductor canal blocks for participants
      undergoing outpatient anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery.

      The objective of this study is to compare the pain control benefit of two different types of
      nerve blocks. Ropivacaine, which is FDA-approved for use in both femoral nerve blocks as
      well as adductor canal blocks, will be utilized. The study will be comparing the efficacy
      between FDA approved treatments.
