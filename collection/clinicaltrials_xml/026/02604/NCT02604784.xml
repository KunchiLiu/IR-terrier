      Single center, open label, non-randomized, single-arm, repeated single dose study to explore
      the efficacy, safety, and Overall Response Rate (ORR) of cisplatin, oxaliplatin and
      doxorubicin when given as a pressurized intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIPAC) to patients
      (men and women) with peritoneal carcinomatosis from ovarian, gastric and colorectal cancers
      and in primary cancers of peritoneum.

    <description>PIPAC with:
Cisplatin 7.5 mg/m2 body surface in 150 ml NaCl 0,9% + Doxorubicin 1.5 mg/m2 body surface in 50 ml NaCl 0,9% in patients with ovarian, gastric cancer and in primary peritoneal tumors.
Oxaliplatin 92 mg/m2 body surface in 150 ml dextrose solution in patients with colorectal cancer.
Drugs will be delivered through Pressurized IntraPeritoneal Air-flow Chemotherapy inside for 30 minutes; injection parameters are a flow of 30 ml/min and a max upstream pressure of 200 psi at 12 mm Hg.</description>

    <description>An open access with a midline 5-6 cm incision is performed and a single-port platform is positioned. A 12 mm Hg CO2 pneumoperitoneum is inflated. Ascites is removed if present and the amount documented. PC extent is evaluated according to Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) and peritoneal biopsies are taken. A nebulizer (MIP, Regr Medizintechnik, Rottweil, Germany) is connected to an intravenous high-pressure injector and inserted into the peritoneal cavity; the tightness of the abdomen has to be documented with a CO2 zero-flow. The laparoscopic camera and the nebulizer are maintained in position by a self-retaining retractor (Thompson). A pressurized aerosol containing drugs is delivered. The capnoperitoneum is then maintained for 30 minutes at 37°C. At the end, the aerosol is exsufflated through two sequential micro-particle filters into the air-waste system of the hospital.</description>
