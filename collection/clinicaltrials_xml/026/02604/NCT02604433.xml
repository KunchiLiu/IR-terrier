    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to
      determine the efficacy and safety of luspatercept (ACE-536) plus Best supportive care (BSC)
      versus placebo plus BSC in adults who require regular red blood cell transfusion due to
      (β)-thalassemia.

      The study is divided into the Screening/Run-in Period, double-blind Treatment Period,
      double-blind Long-term Treatment Period, and Post-treatment Follow-up Period.

                  preceding 24 consecutive months). FCBP participating in the study must:

          -  Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to starting
             study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the

             true abstinence from heterosexual contact.

          -  Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on
             a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use, and be able to comply with,
             effective contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting
             investigational product, during the study therapy (including dose interruptions), and
             for 12 weeks (approximately five times the mean terminal half-life of luspatercept
             based on multiple-dose Pharmacokinetic PK) data) after discontinuation of study
             therapy.

             study, during dose interruptions and for at least 12 weeks (approximately five times
             the mean terminal half-life of luspatercept based on multiple-dose PK data) following
             investigational product discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful
             vasectomy.

          1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness
             that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
