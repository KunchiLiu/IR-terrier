  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rib fractures are common injuries in accident patients and can be associated with
      significant pain during recovery. If poorly controlled, pain from splinting due to rib
      fractures can result in difficulty in breathing leading to incomplete expansion of lung, and
      even the need to put a patient on a ventilator to help them breathe. Therefore, pain control
      is critical in managing patients with rib fractures. To date, many studies have shown the
      effectiveness of continuous intercostal nerve blockade (a slow release of pain medications
      at the site of injury that prevents the transmission of pain signals). This approach has
      never been studied in a randomized fashion in rib fracture patients, and has never been
      compared to patient-controlled narcotic pain medication, commonly used at many hospitals.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the placement of an
      elastomeric infusion pump (a small, external, wearable balloon used to deliver medication
      over time) attached to a continuous infusion catheter or &quot;soaker&quot; catheter (a tube which
      releases the pain medication through tiny holes in it, right at the site of injury) to
      deliver local anesthetic medication to reduce pain caused by two or more rib fractures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of rib fractures using an elastomeric infusion pump (a small, external, wearable
      balloon used to deliver medication over time) containing pain medication and a continuous
      infusion catheter or &quot;soaker&quot; catheter (a tube which releases the pain medication through
      tiny holes in it, right at the site of injury) placed in the extrathoracic paraspinous space
      (a site in the back that is near the broken ribs) to create a continuous intercostal nerve
      block is relatively novel. Truitt and colleagues have published two studies evaluating the
      effectiveness of this approach. A pilot study on 30 patients was published in 2010 showing
      that placement of these catheters was a safe, viable and effective procedure, and resulted
      in decreased pain scores in rib fracture patients. A second study included 102 patients
      studied prospectively (from the time of admission to the hospital) comparing epidural
      anesthesia (an injection of anesthetic into the spine) with local catheter delivery in a
      non-randomized fashion in 2011. This approach is beginning to be more widely used, but has
      never been studied in a randomized fashion, and has never been compared to
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA, delivery of a pain medication by the push of a button),
      commonly used at many hospitals.

      We hypothesize that accident patients with two or more rib fractures who receive pain
      control through the continuous infusion system will achieve improved pain control in a
      dose-dependent fashion, improved lung function, and therefore, will require less narcotic
      pain medication, achieve discharge criteria earlier and have a shorter hospital length of
      stay in comparison to patients treated with PCA alone.
