      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of Proactive Case Detection to
      Community Case Management will provide an increase in early access to health care and a
      reduction in deaths among children aged 0-59 months. Integrated Community Case Management is
      the package of community-based services for children delivered by Community Health Workers
      (CHW), including diagnosis and treatment of malaria, pneumonia, diarrheal disease and
      malnutrition. In many i-CCM interventions, CHWs are stationed in their villages and
      available in a passive, reactive manner to provide care to patients who seek them out. This
      study seeks to determine whether the addition of proactive case detection by CHWs, in which
      the conduct daily door-to-door home visits to find and care for patients, improve early
      access to care and reduce child mortality.

      Villages will be randomised to receive Integrated Community Case Management (i-CCM) from a
      passive CHW or Proactive Community Case Management (Pro-CCM) from a CHW that conducts daily
      active case finding home visits. All villages in both study arms will receive additional
      interventions that could significantly reduce under-five mortality, including removal of
      point-of-care fees, clinical staff training at primary health centres, and improvement in
      health centre infrastructure.

      All women of reproductive age eligible for inclusion in the study will be surveyed at
      baseline, and again at 12, 24 and 36 months. The study hypothesis is a significant reduction
      in child mortality in both study arms, with a significantly larger reduction where there is
      proactive case detection, or Pro-CCM, by CHWs. An exhaustive survey of 22 847 women of
      reproductive age followed for three years will give a study which has 90% power to detect an
      absolute difference of 0.75% (and a relative difference of 25%) in under-five child
      mortality reduction between the two study arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial to evaluate whether the addition of
      proactive case detection to Community Case Management will provide an increase in early
      access to care and a reduction in deaths among children aged 0-59 months. The unit of
      randomisation is the village, as defined by the Government of Mali's Health Information
      Systems. Villages will be randomised to receive Integrated Community Case Management (i-CCM)
      from a passive CHW or Proactive Community Case Management (Pro-CCM) from a CHW that conducts
      daily active case finding home visits. Randomisation will be stratified by health catchment
      area, distance from the primary health care clinic, and CHW supervisor. All villages in both
      study arms will receive the removal of point-of-care fees, clinical staff training at
      primary health centres, and improvement in health centre infrastructure.

      An exhaustive census will be administered to the population of the study area (both arms) at
      baseline. The census will assign a unique identification number to each person surveyed. At
      each household, a screening will take place to identify women eligible for inclusion.
      Eligible women identified in the study area will be asked to give written informed consent
      for their inclusion in the study (or their legal guardians in the case of unemancipated
      minors). The baseline survey will be administered after consent is obtained. Using the
      unique census ID number, the same participants will be identified and surveyed again at 12,
      24 and 36 months.

      The survey tool is excerpted and adapted from Mali's Demographic and Health Survey. The
      survey tool will collect qualitative and quantitative data on health seeking behaviour and
      health outcomes. It will include a life-table tracking all live births occurring in the 59
      months prior to enrolment and during the 36 months of study follow up. Surveyors will not be
      members of the villages they survey, nor will they be members of the intervention health
      care delivery staff. All surveyors will be female, as the survey tool contains potentially
      sensitive questions on family planning.

      Community Health Workers will collect data on the number of active case finding visits they
      conduct, the number of patients they treat, the delay from symptom onset to treatment onset
      for each patient, the gestational age at pregnancy diagnosis and first prenatal
      consultation, and the care services they provide. This data is collected during patient care
      by CHWs on smartphones using the Medic Mobile for CHWs platform customized for Pro-CCM.
      Primary care health centre providers will collect patient care data per village.

      An exhaustive survey of 22 847 women of reproductive age followed for three years will give
      a study which has 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 0.75% (and a relative
      difference of 25%) in under-five child mortality reduction between the two study arms.

    <description>Cost effectiveness ratios will be presented from three perspectives (i) intervention costs alone, (ii) potential costs/savings to health providers (MoH), (iii) potential societal costs/savings, which includes both health providers and households. Costs to the health care providers and households associated with Pro-CCM and i-CCM will be collected as part of routine trial data collection where possible, with supplementary cost and resource use data collected when necessary. In addition, the economic costs to the health system will be based on detailed cost data from Community Health Workers and health facilities. A standardised costing template will be used in all the sites to record resource use associated with personnel, materials and supplies, equipment, transport, utilities and buildings. Effects will be based on trial outcomes. Specifically, economic evaluation will explore cost of Pro-CCM per disability-adjusted life year saved among children aged 0-59 months.</description>

    <description>Whether a Pro-CCM program would be affordable to the Ministry of Health will be explored. A simple model forecasting the costs of introducing and sustaining Pro-CCM will be developed and this will run using various 'delivery' (supply) and 'uptake' (demand) scenarios. This model will help to inform decision makers about the affordability of implementing Pro-CCM in their setting.</description>
