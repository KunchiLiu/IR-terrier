      Purpose of the study:

      The investigators are proposing that melanomas which respond and develop eventual disease
      stability in response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy undergo a genetic program
      promoting secondary resistance.

      Understanding these genetic alterations and the factors which contribute to this process
      would be critical for the identification of novel immunotherapeutic targets which may
      synergize with the T cell-targeted checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, this work promises to
      provide greater insight into tumor-mediated immune evasion mechanisms and primary
      immunotherapy resistance, potentially unveiling predictive markers of clinical response for
      our expanding arsenal of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.

      Many patients who exhibit a response to the anti-PD-1 antibodies develop a prolonged course
      of disease stability which resembles the equilibrium phase of the previously proposed
      process of cancer immunoediting. This state of equipoise has been hypothesized to involve
      genetic alterations that promote immune evasion and, in some cases, lead to the development
      of tumor escape. Based on our data, the investigators propose that melanomas that develop a
      period of disease stability in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy exhibit genetic
      alterations that suppress the effectiveness of anti-tumor immunity. Our previous studies
      indicate that the tumor-derived factors that play a role in the paracrine signaling pathways
      capable of regulating nearby stromal cell populations are more likely to be critical immune
      regulators of the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the investigators will focus our
      studies on those differentially expressed genes which encode soluble proteins using an
      available prediction algorithm. Those genes identified by this study to be differentially
      expressed in the melanoma tissues of patients demonstrating a clinical response to immune
      checkpoint inhibitor therapy will be further evaluated in transgenic autochthonous melanoma
      models.

        Eligible patients with stage IV or unresectable stage IIIC melanoma selected to undergo
        either anti-CTLA-4 antibody (ipilimumab) or anti-PD-1 antibody (pembrolizumab, nivolumab)
        immunotherapy will be asked to participate in the study by the Principal Investigator,
        co-Investigators, or clinical staff.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma, with melanoma validated by
             histology or cytology

          -  Patients may participate with primary cutaneous melanomas of unknown primary site,
             primary mucosal melanomas, or ocular melanomas

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months

             deep hepatic lesions near critical anatomic structures. Each patient will be
             individually discussed by a physician panel comprised of the study PI, a study
             sub-investigator, and an independent interventional radiologist prior to enrollment.
