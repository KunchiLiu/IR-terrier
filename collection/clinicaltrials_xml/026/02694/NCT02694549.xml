             removal including hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or arterio-venous fistula.

          -  Prior femoral vascular surgery or vascular graft in region of access site.

          -  Documented chronic peripheral arterial insufficiency preventing the use of the
             femoral technique

          -  Patients who are currently participating in another clinical trial of an
             investigational drug or device that has not concluded the follow-up period.
