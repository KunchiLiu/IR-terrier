    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the potential effects of visible light on
      the skin. More specifically, this study will examine whether an incandescent lamp (light
      bulb) or LED light bulb can cause skin to become darker. Investigators will determine the
      minimum threshold dose required to achieve immediate pigmentation darkening (IPD),
      persistent pigmentation darkening (PPD), and delayed tanning (DT) for Fitzpatrick skin types
      IV - VI utilizing two visible light sources.

    <description>The study doctor will shine 2 different light bulbs (one a regular or incandescent bulb and the other an LED light bulb) on 12 different areas of patients skin approximately 6 square centimeters in size (less than 1 square inch or the size of your thumb nail). Each light bulb will be exposed to your skin for approximately 20 - 35 minutes. After exposure, the study doctor will perform skin assessments at 3 time points:
Immediately after the light exposure;
30 minutes after light exposure; and
1 hour after light exposure.</description>
