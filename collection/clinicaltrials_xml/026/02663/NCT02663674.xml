  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 1000 individuals
      aged 18 years or older, with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) who meet all eligibility
      criteria in endemic regions. This study is designed to provide data on the effectiveness of
      early antifungal treatment (Fluconazole, 400 mg/day) for coccidioidomycosis pneumonia (also
      referred to as Valley Fever (VF) Pneumonia or acute onset valley fever) vs. placebo in
      subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia. Patients who are prescribed antibacterials by
      their health care provider for acute CAP will be randomized to receive either placebo or 400
      mg/day of fluconazole for 42 days. The primary objective is to assess the clinical response
      of early empiric antifungal therapy with fluconazole through Day 22 in subjects with
      coccidioidomycosis pneumonia and are compliant with the study intervention.

      This is a Phase IV randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 1000 individuals,
      aged 18 years or older, with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) who meet all eligibility
      criteria in endemic regions. This study is designed to provide data on the effectiveness of
      early antifungal treatment (Fluconazole, 400 mg/day) for coccidioidomycosis pneumonia (also
      referred to as Valley Fever (VF) Pneumonia or acute onset valley fever) vs. placebo in
      subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia. Patients who are prescribed antibacterials by
      their health care provider for acute CAP will be randomized to receive either placebo or 400
      mg/day of fluconazole for 42 days. Blood work for serologic determination of
      coccidioidomycosis infection will be drawn at the time of randomization (Day 1), and again
      on Days 15, 22, 29. On Day 43, subjects will be informed of their coccidioidomycosis status
      and their treatment assignment. Those who receive placebo and are coccidioidomycosis
      negative will be dismissed from the study after the Day 43 visit; those who are
      coccidioidomycosis positive will be referred to a health care provider with the results of
      their serology testing and their treatment assignment for further treatment as indicated and
      will return for follow-up visits on Days 90 and 180. Those who receive fluconazole and are
      coccidioidomycosis negative will remain in the study for an additional 6 days for safety
      follow-up only; those who are coccidioidomycosis positive will be referred to a healthcare
      provider with the results of their serology testing and their treatment assignment for
      further treatment as indicated and will return at Days 90 and 180 and will be contacted via
      phone on Day 49. The study duration will be approximately 72 months, and the subject
      participant duration will be from 42 days to approximately 6 months. The primary clinical
      outcome will be time to achieve clinical response based on signs and symptoms of pneumonia
      via FLEET CAP score through Day 22. Secondary outcomes will be measured and include the time
      to clinical response among subjects with coccidioidomycosis pneumonia through Day 43; the
      mean, median and quartiles for both individual components and composite symptom scores over
      the evaluable points during the duration of the study period; the mean, median and quartiles
      for responses to individual items and composite Extra-Pulmonary Symptom Scores in the
      absence of disseminated disease; the time missed from work or school and SF-12v2 and the
      incidence rates of all-cause mortality and hospitalization among subjects with
      coccidioidomycosis pneumonia.
