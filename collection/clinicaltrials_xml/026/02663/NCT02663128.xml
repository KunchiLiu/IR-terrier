      The purpose of this study is to measure how much of a new tablet formulation of AZD3293 gets
      into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it, compared to the
      current tablet formulation of AZD3293. The effect of a high fat meal on how quickly the body
      absorbs the new tablet formulation will also be evaluated. In addition any side effects of
      the study drug using both the new and current tablet formulations will be evaluated. The
      study will last about 22 days, with screening required within 30 days prior to the start of
      the study.

        or confirmed by medical history or menopause

        - Are able to eat a high-fat, high-calorie meal within the defined time limit and abide by
        the food restrictions throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

             determined by the investigator or dermatologist

          -  History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or any other
