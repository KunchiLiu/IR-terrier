  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a multicomponent lipid emulsion
      containing 30% soybean oil, 30% medium-chain triglycerides, 25% olive oil, and 15% fish oil
      with a conventional pure soybean oil lipid emulsion on the incidence of neonatal
      cholestasis, infant growth, infant morbidity and the biochemical assessment of liver
      enzymes.

    <textblock>
      Intravenous lipid emulsions are the major sources of non-protein energy and provision of
      required essential fatty acids.

      The reference lipid emulsion, widely used for many years, is prepared from soybean oil,
      which is rich in omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and phytosterols that contribute to
      hepatotoxicity and their metabolites result in pro-inflammatory eicosanoid production.

      Existing evidence strongly supports a pathogenetic role of inflammation and oxidative stress
      on parenteral nutrition associated liver disease.

      Subsequent development of lipid emulsions has focused on reducing the amount of soybean oil
      and replacing it with other oils.Moreover the omega 3 fatty acids from fish oil are
      metabolized to anti-inflammatory eicosanoids which can prevent inflammatory responses.

      A novel multicomponent lipid emulsion may prevent liver injury, improve growth and decrease
      morbidity in preterm infants.
