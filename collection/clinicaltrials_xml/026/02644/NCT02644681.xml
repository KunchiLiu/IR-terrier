      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if the motor-evoked potentials/motor
      action potential amplitude ratio and motor action potential amplitude measurement are useful
      in detecting spinal cord ischemia during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms surgery.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the presence of a correlation between
      neurophysiological changes and other factors (such as surgical maneuvers, anesthetic and
      physiologic changes) in order to find which factor is the most important in determining
      spinal cord ischemia.

      This study is an observational, single-center, prospective study on patients with
      thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms undergoing surgical repair with intraoperative
      motor-evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials monitoring.

    <description>The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of different neurophysiological parameters in predicting patient outcome. In particular, our objective is to verify if a better identification of peripheral nerve ischemia during TAAA procedure can improve the sensibility of Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring in detecting spinal cord ischemia and predicting clinical outcome.
Exploratory univariate analyses will be performed using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios to evaluate neurophysiological parameters associated with poor outcome. Factors that will be found to be significant at p &lt; 0.05 will be then examined in subsequent multivariate analyses to determine significant independent predictors of poor outcome.</description>
