  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerated dose of the study
      drug IMO-2125 that can be given in combination with ipilimumab or in combination with
      pembrolizumab to patients with metastatic melanoma. Researchers also want to learn if the
      study drug combination can help to control the disease. The safety of the drug combination
      will also be studied.

      This is an open-label Phase 1/2 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and efficacy of
      IMO-2125 when administered in combination with ipilimumab or pembrolizumab. The study will
      be conducted in 2 parts; a dose-escalation portion (Phase 1) to evaluate safety and
      tolerability of multiple dose levels and a Phase 2 portion to assess efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma with measurable,
             stage III (lymph node or in transit lesions) or stage IVA, IVB, or IVC disease.

          -  Patients must have symptomatic or radiographic confirmed progression after treatment
             with a PD-1 inhibitor administered either as monotherapy or in combination (except
             for ipilimumab or other CTLA-4 inhibitor combination).

               1. The interval between last PD-1 directed treatment and start of study treatment
                  should be at least 21 days.

               2. No intervening anti-cancer therapy between the last course of anti-PD-1
                  containing treatment and the first dose of study treatment is allowed except for
                  local measures (e.g., surgical excision or biopsy, focal RT).
