      Clinical evaluation of stenfilcon A compared with narafilcon A and delefilcon A

      This is a total 120 subject, randomized, open label, bilateral wear, two week crossover
      study (each lens for 1 week) evaluating the clinical performance of stenfilcon A spherical
      lenses compared to narafilcon A or delefilcon A spherical lenses.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of stenfilcon A compared with
      narafilcon A and delefilcon A.

      The study group will be allocated into two groups, of 60 subjects each, based on the control
      lenses, narafilcon A and delefilcon A spherical lenses.

      Study groups:

        1. stenfilcon A vs. narafilcon A group

        2. stenfilcon A vs. delefilcon A group
