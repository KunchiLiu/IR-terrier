             at screening by fulfilling 1 of the following criteria:

               -  Post-menopausal defined as amenorrhea for at least 12 months or more following
                  cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments and follicle-stimulating hormone

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease, or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion

             they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
