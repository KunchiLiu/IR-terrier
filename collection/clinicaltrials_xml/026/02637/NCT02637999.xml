      Randomized open-label substudy of daily Myrcludex B plus pegylated interferon-alpha-2a in
      patients with HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B co-infected with hepatitis delta

      The study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of MXB in a subset of HBV infected
      patients who are co-infected with hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Hepatitis delta represents
      the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis and there is no approved treatment option
      available for patients infected with both HBV and HDV.

      24 patients will be randomised into 3 arms: pre-treatment with MXB followed by pegylated
      interferon-alpha-2a (further PEG-INF-a) treatment versus a combination of both drugs versus
      pegylated interferon-alpha-2a.

      Prolonged blockade of HBV entry into hepatocytes should also block infection with HDV
      particles (which uses HBsAg as its envelope) and thus provide a therapeutic option for this
      otherwise hardly treatable disease. PEG-INF-a is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis
      delta. The study endpoints are virological response (HBsAg, HDV RNA, HBV DNA), as well as
      safety and tolerability and drug immunogenicity.

             screening period. Co-infection with hepatitis D virus defined as positive anti-HDV
             antibodies for at least 3 months and positive for HDV-RNA within the screening
             period.

          -  Liver biopsy performed within one year prior to screening or during screening period.

          -  HBeAg negative

             to enrolment.
