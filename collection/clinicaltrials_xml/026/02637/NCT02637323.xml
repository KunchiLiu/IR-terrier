  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single administration study of 40 mg of FX006 and Triamcinolone
      Acetonide Injectable Suspension, USP (referred to as TCA IR in the protocol) conducted in
      male and female patients with Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 patients with OA of the knee (10 per Cohort) will be treated with a single
      5mL intra-articular (IA) injection of 40 mg of FX006 or a single 1 mL injection of 40 mg of
      TCA IR.

      Patients will be enrolled sequentially into one of six cohorts. Cohorts A through E will
      receive 40 mg of FX006. Cohort F will receive 40 mg of TCA IR. Synovial Fluid Visits are as
      follows for each cohort: Cohort A: 20 Weeks, Cohort B: 16 Weeks, Cohort C: 12 Weeks, Cohort
      D and F: 6 Weeks, Cohort E: 1 Week. Each patient will be evaluated for safety during his/her
      participation in the study and plasma and synovial fluid will be collected for drug
      concentration measurements.
