      This is a multicenter, open label, Phase 1/2 study in pediatric patients with advanced solid
      or primary CNS tumors. LOXO‑101 (larotrectinib) will be administered orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID), with the dose adjusted by body surface area (BSA).

      Dose Escalation Phase will proceed through the planned 4 dose levels, or until the MTD is
      reached, or until the Sponsor determines that a suitable dose has been achieved based on PK
      exposure..

      Expansion Cohorts may be enrolled to better characterize safety and efficacy in patients
      with specific abnormalities in the NTRK genes or proteins.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patients ≥ 1 year old on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1)

          -  Phase 1 only: Between 1 and 21 years of age at C1D1 with a locally advanced or
             metastatic solid tumor or primary CNS tumor that has relapsed, progressed or was
             nonresponsive to available therapies and for which no standard or available systemic
             curative therapy, or ≥1 month old with a diagnosis malignancy and with a documented
             NTRK fusion that has progressed or was nonresponsive to available therapies, and for
             which no standard or available curative therapy exists or patients with locally
             advanced infantile fibrosarcoma who would require, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, disfiguring surgery or limb amputation to achieve a complete surgical
             resection

          -  Phase 2 only: Ages &gt;/= 1 month of age at C1D1 with a locally advanced or metastatic
             infantile fibrosarcoma, Patients with locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma who
             would require, in the opinion of the Investigator, disfiguring surgery or limb
             amputation to achieve a complete surgical resection enrollment or ages 1 month
             through 21 years of age at C1D1 with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor or
             primary CNS tumor that has relapsed, progressed or was nonresponsive to available
             therapies and for which no standard or available systemic curative therapy with a

             the Cockroft-Gault formula or: a serum creatinine based on age/gender as outlined in
             the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigational agent, anticancer therapy, or major surgery within 14 days (2 weeks)
             prior to C1D1

          -  Clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or history of prolonged QT
             interval corrected for heart rate (QTc)

          -  Current treatment with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor or inducer
             (EIAEDs and dexamethasone for CNS tumors or metastases, on a stable dose, are
             allowed)

          -  Phase 2 Only: Prior progression while receiving approved or investigational tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors targeting TRK, including entrectinib, crizotinib and lestaurtanib.

             discontinued because of intolerance remain eligible.
