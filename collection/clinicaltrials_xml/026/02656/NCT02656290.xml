      The objective of this trial is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Edwards
      Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 11000A in the pulmonary position in subjects five
      years or older requiring replacement of their native or prosthetic pulmonary valve.

      This is a prospective, Non-Randomized, Single Arm, Multicenter study. Up to one hundred
      (100) pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) subjects at up to ten (10) clinical sites will be
      enrolled to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Edwards Peri-cardial Aortic
      Bioprosthesis Model 11000A in the pulmonary position. The trial will include male and female
      subjects five year and older requiring pulmonary valve replacement of their native or
      prosthetic valve. Subjects will be followed for and assessed after implant for up to 5
      years.
