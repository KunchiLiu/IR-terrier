  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate to severe pain caused by medical conditions or surgery, who require
      IV opioid therapy may be enrolled in this open label safety study. Patients will be treated
      with TRV130 by IV bolus, PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) administration, or both, as
      determined by the investigator, for a duration not to exceed 14 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of treatment for each patient will be determined by the clinical need for
      parenteral opioid therapy. Eligible patients with moderate to severe pain caused by medical
      conditions or surgery, who require IV opioid therapy may be enrolled in this open label
      safety study. Patients will be treated with TRV130 by IV bolus, PCA administration, or both,
      as determined by the investigator, for a duration not to exceed 14 days. The duration of
      treatment for each patient will be determined by the clinical need for parenteral opioid
      therapy. A follow-up assessment will take place 2-3 days after the completion of the
      treatment phase.

    <description>For clinician-administered bolus dosing, TRV130 initial dose is administered and supplemental dosing is available, if clinically indicated. Subsequent doses may be administered every 1 to 3 hours as needed.
For PCA dosing, the TRV130 regimen consists of a loading dose, a demand dose, and a lockout interval.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria include:

          -  Moderate to severe acute pain for which parenteral opioid therapy is warranted

          -  Able to understand and comply with the procedures and study requirements, and to
             provide written informed consent before any study procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria include:

          -  Clinically significant medical, surgical, postsurgical, psychiatric or substance
             abuse condition or history of such condition that would confound the interpretation

          -  Hemodynamic instability or respiratory insufficiency.

          -  Advanced cancer in palliative or end-of-life care.

          -  Another current painful condition (other than acute pain for which parenteral opioid
             therapy is warranted) that would confound the interpretation of safety, tolerability,
             or efficacy data in the study.

          -  Clinically significant, immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to opioids.
