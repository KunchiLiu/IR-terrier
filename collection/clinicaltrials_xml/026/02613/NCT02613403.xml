  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial of the combination regimen of MK-5172
      (grazoprevir [GZR]) (100 mg), MK-3682 (450 mg) and MK-8408 (ruzasvir) (60 mg) for 16 weeks
      with ribavirin (RBV) or 24 weeks without RBV in cirrhotic (C) or non-cirrhotic (NC)
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1 or GT3-infected participants who have previously
      failed a direct-acting antiviral regimen (DAA). The combination regimen will be administered
      as two fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets, referred to as MK-3682B, given once-daily.

      The study will evaluate the efficacy of the combination regimen of MK-5172 (GZR), MK-3682
      and MK-8408 (ruzasvir) with or without ribavirin as assessed by the proportion of
      participants achieving Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks (SVR12) after the end of all
      study therapy.

      Prior to enrollment of GT3-infected subjects, the safety and efficacy data for GT3 subjects
      being dosed in Part B of MK-3682-012 (NCT02332720) will be reviewed. Participants in
      MK-5172-017 (NCT01667081) are eligible for enrollment in the study.
