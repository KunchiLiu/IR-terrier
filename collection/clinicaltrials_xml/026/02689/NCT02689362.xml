    <textblock>
      This phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study with four parallel
      treatment groups, with active control, will be performed in Brazilian study sites under the
      sponsorship of Eurofarma Laboratórios S.A.. The enrollment for participants in the study
      will start after the relevant ethical and regulatory approvals and will have an estimated
      duration of 18 months.

      One hundred and forty-four participants with T2DM according to the criteria of ADA who
      consent to participation in the study by signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be
      enrolled in the study. In order to be enrolled, the patients must meet all the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The eligible participants will be randomized
      1:1:1:1 to receive evogliptin (EVO) at the doses of 2.5 mg/day (N = 36), 5.0 mg/day (N = 36)
      or 10 mg/day (N = 36) or sitagliptin (SITA) at the dose of 100 mg/day (N = 36), as a single
      daily dose, for 12 weeks.
