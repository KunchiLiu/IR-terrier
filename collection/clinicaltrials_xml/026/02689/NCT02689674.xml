      Primary objective #1: Determine the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC in the full
      study sample with regard to treatment engagement over weeks 1-12 and alcohol use over weeks
      1-24.

      Hypothesis 1: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with the
      patient and provides the chosen option (e.g., MI-PC) will produce higher rates of treatment
      engagement than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only (e.g., MI-IOP).

      Hypothesis 2: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with the
      patient and provides the chosen option (e.g., MI-PC) will produce better alcohol use
      outcomes than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only (MI-IOP).

      Secondary analysis 1: Among the Non-engaged patients, determine rates of selection of each
      of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and alcohol use outcomes
      in each option.

      Secondary analysis 2: Among the Engaged patients, determine rates of selection of each of
      the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and alcohol use outcomes in
      each option.

      Primary objective #2: Determine whether the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC
      varies as a function of engagement group, with regard to treatment engagement over weeks
      1-12 and alcohol use outcomes over weeks 1-24.

      Hypothesis 1: The predicted main effect on retention favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP will be
      significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged group than among those in the Engaged
      group.

      Hypothesis 2: The predicted main effect on cocaine use outcomes favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP
      will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged group than among those in the
      Engaged group.

      3. Secondary objective #1: Examine outcomes on three secondary measures: percent days
      abstinent from all substances, negaÂ¬tive consequences of alcohol use, and HIV high risk
      behaviors.

      Hypothesis 1: Outcomes on the secondary measures will be better in MI-PC than in MI-IOP.

      4. Secondary objective #2: Test hypotheses concerning potential mediators of the predicted
      main effect favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP.

      Hypothesis 1: The predicted advantage of MI-PC over MI-IOP will be mediated by greater
      increases in motivation, self-efficacy, commitment to abstinence, and self-help involvement
      in MI-PC.

      5. Secondary objective #3: Test hypotheses concerning effect of additional MI intervention
      after initial non-engagement persists through 12 weeks.

      Hypothesis 1: A second telephone MI intervention will produce higher rates of subsequent
      engagement and less alcohol use than no further MI.
