  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1278863 is an orally available, hypoxia-inducible factor - prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor,
      currently being investigated as a treatment for anemia associated with chronic kidney
      disease. GSK1278863 has been given as a once daily regimen in clinical studies to date.
      However, physicians in countries that use a three-times weekly hemodialysis schedule prefer
      to give the anemia medicine at the same time as the dialysis session. This study will test
      how well GSK1278863 can maintain hemoglobin levels when given three-times weekly, for 29
      days.

      This study will describe the relationship between hemoglobin and GSK1278863 given
      three-times weekly. The data from this study will allow for conversion of once daily doses
      to three-times weekly doses.
