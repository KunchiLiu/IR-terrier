      The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence of human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA)
      in high-risk neuroblastoma patients treated with Unituxin combination therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label study in patients with high-risk
      neuroblastoma to assess the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of Unituxin combination
      therapy. Patients enrolled in the study were prescribed Unituxin for the treatment of
      high-risk neuroblastoma.

Course 4— Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
Course 5— Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
Course 6— Prior to the first dose of 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA)
