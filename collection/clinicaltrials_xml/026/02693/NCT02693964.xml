      The study is aimed to evaluate the differences in bone mineral density (BMD) and Carotid
      Intima Media Thickness (CIMT) between postmenopausal women with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
      compared to postmenopausal women without diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease requiring lifelong insulin treatment. Having
      T1D increases the risk of death, especially in women with T1D.

      Heart disease and fractures due to osteoporosis (brittle bones) are the leading causes of
      death in women with T1D.

      Since both diseases share certain common risk factors such as age, menopause, smoking,
      physical inactivity, and diabetes, this study is aimed to find link between bone density and
      cardiovascular risk.

      This study has only one visit. All participants will undergone bone density testing using
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) machine and measurement of carotid intima media
      thickness (a marker of carotid atherosclerosis) using carotid ultrasound.
