    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Alimta (pemetrexed) can help to
      control urothelial cancer. The safety of this drug will also be studied. Researchers will
      also study how a gene called MTAP may affect the way the study drug works.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Within 7 to 14 days before participants's first dose of pemetrexed:

        -  Participant will start a vitamin pill (folic acid) at least 7 days before the first
           dose of study drug. Participant will continue to take this drug while they are
           receiving treatment. Folic acid has been found to decrease some of the side effects of
           pemetrexed.

        -  Participant will start vitamin B12. B12 is given by injection into the muscle. It must
           be started at least 7 days before the first dose of treatment. It will be given every 9
           weeks during participant's treatment. B12 has been found to decrease some of the side
           effects of pemetrexed.

        -  If participant is able to become pregnant and the study doctor thinks it is needed, the
           pregnancy blood test (about 1 tablespoon) will be repeated.

        -  Participant will start taking dexamethasone by mouth which may decrease some of the
           side effects of pemetrexed. Participant should take it twice a day on the day before,
           on the day of, and after each dose of pemetrexed.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive
      pemetrexed by vein over about 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles. If participant has had these performed within 7 days, they need not
      be repeated.

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 3 cycles:

        -  Participant will have a bone scan and CT scans and/or MRI to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  Participant will have a positron emission tomography (PET) scan if they had one at
           screening.

        -  Participant will have bone scan if the disease has spread to their bones.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tumor marker testing.

      Length of Dosing:

      Participant may take pemetrexed for as long as the doctor thinks it is in their best
      interest. Participant may no longer be able to take the study drug if intolerable side
      effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.

      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      If the study drug is stopped early, or when participant is taken off study for any reason,
      within 3 weeks of their last dose of study drug the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have the PET scan, CT scan and/or
           MRI to check the status of the disease.

      Follow-Up Visits/Calls:

      Participant will have additional follow up visits every 3 months for a total of 5 years. If
      participant is not able to travel someone will call them to find out how they are doing. The
      call will last about 5-10 minutes each time.

      This is an investigational study. Pemetrexed is FDA approved for the treatment of
      mesothelioma and non small cell lung cancer. Pemetrexed is not FDA approved for urothelial
      cancer. It is being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histological confirmation of metastatic urothelial carcinoma.
             Patients must have sufficient tumor tissues for future MTAP testing (at least 5
             unstained IHC slides to tissue blocks). Histological variants such as glandular,
             squamous,sarcomatoid, micropapillary, plasmacytoid, and small cell changes will not
             be allowed for this trial.

          2. All patients must have measurable disease. In general, liver and lung lesions should
             be at least 1 cm, and patients with node-only disease should have lesions of &gt;/= 1.5
             cm in greatest dimension. Patients with disease confined to bone may be eligible if a
             measurable lytic defect is present. The study PI is the final arbiter in questions
             related to measurability. Patients with a three-dimensional mass or pelvic sidewall
             fixation on bladder examination under anesthesia are considered to have measurable
             disease.

          3. Patients who have received any non-anti-folate containing neoadjuvant or systemic
             chemotherapy are eligible. Any prior intravesical therapy, or immunotherapy is
             allowed.

          4. Patients must have an ECOG performance status &lt;/= 2.

          5. Adequate liver function as defined by AST or ALT &lt;/= 3 x ULN, or &lt;/= 5 x ULN if
             documented liver metastases are present.

          6. Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN, except subjects with Gilbert's syndrome or liver
             metastases, who must have a baseline total bilirubin &lt;/= 3.0 mg/dL.

          7. Adequate bone marrow reserves as define by an ANC &gt;/= 1500, and platelets &gt;/=
             100,000.

          8. Adequate renal function as defined by a normal serum creatinine, or a creatinine
             clearance &gt;/= 45 ml/min [either measured using a 24 hour urine, calculated using
             Cockcroft-Gault, or estimated using the MDRD method from the National Kidney Disease
             Education Program (NKDEP) (the method reported by MDACC laboratories)]
             Cockcroft-Gault formula: CLcr = [(140-age) wt(kg)] / [72 Creat (mg/dL)] (Multiply by
             0.85 for females)

          9. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male
             partner and non-sterilized males must use a highly effective method of contraception
             for 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product, and must agree to
             continue using such precautions for 180 days after the final dose of investigational
             product; cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a
             responsible physician.

         10. inclusion 9 continued: They must also refrain from egg cell donation for 180 days
             after the final dose of investigational product; a) Females of childbearing potential
             are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation,
             bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12
             months with no menses without an alternative medical cause)

         11. inclusion 9 continued: b) A highly effective method of contraception is defined as
             one that results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used
             consistently and correctly. The acceptable methods of contraception are: Barrier
             Method (e.g. male condom with spermicide, copper T intrauterine device, or
             levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system - Mirena®) or Hormonal Methods (e.g.
             implants, hormone shot or injection, combined pill, minipill, or
             patch).Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception from Days
             1-180 post last dose. In addition, they must refrain from sperm donation for 180 days
             after the final dose of investigational product.

         12. The ability to interrupt NSAIDS 2 days before (5 days for long-acting NSAIDs), the
             day of, and 2 days following administration of Pemetrexed.

         13. The ability to take folic acid, Vitamin B12, and dexamethasone according to protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancies or CNS metastases, including
             leptomeningeal metastases, are not allowed. Subjects with previously treated brain
             metastases will be allowed if the brain metastases have been stable for at least 3
             months following prior treatment (radiotherapy or surgery).

          2. Patients who received previous anti-folate-containing chemotherapy.

          3. Any other malignancy from which the patient has been disease-free for less than 3
             years, except for non-melanoma skin cancer, controlled localized prostate cancer, in
             situ carcinoma of any site.

          4. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          5. Presence of third space fluid which cannot be controlled by drainage. For patients
             who develop or have baseline clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusions
             (on the basis of symptoms or clinical examination) before or during initiation of
             Pemetrexed therapy, consideration should be given to draining the effusion prior to
             dosing. However, if, in the investigator's opinion, the effusion represents
             progression of disease, the patient should be discontinued from study therapy.
