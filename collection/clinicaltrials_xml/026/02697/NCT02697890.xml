      The objective of this study is to evaluate clinically and radiographically the effect of
      Mucograft® seal when used for the ridge preservation procedure in combination with Freeze
      Dried Bone Allograft (FDBA) at the extraction site in terms of hard and soft tissue
      remodeling after 4 months healing period.

      One of the serious consequences of single or multiple tooth extraction is the bone
      resorption that follows, which may create aesthetic problems and compromise future implant
      placement. Ridge preservation procedures typically use a combination of a scaffold and a
      membrane. Scaffolds most commonly used are bone grafts; autogenous, allografts, xenografts,
      and alloplasts. Among these bone grafts, allograft materials such as Demineralized Freeze
      Dried Bone Allograft (DFDBA) and Freeze Dried Bone Allograft (FDBA) are frequently used in
      site preservation procedures.

      An additional alternative is to use a collagen sponge (CS) in the extraction socket to
      prevent the infiltration of soft tissues to the lower area and to protect and maintain bone
      graft materials.

      Although ridge preservation has several benefits, it also has several risks and limitations,
      such as membrane exposure and possible infection, loss or fibrous encapsulation of graft
      particles, longer healing period prior to implant placement, invasive and technique
      sensitive procedure, additional cost, and possible soft tissue dehiscence in bone grafted
      sites compared with non-grafted sites. Therefore, any modifications of the technique that
      will reduce these risks and limitations would be advantageous.

      Mucograft® TM has been specifically designed for soft-tissue regeneration. Its bi-layer
      structure supports tissue in-growth and regeneration and promotes cellular and extracellular
      integration within the host tissue. Clinically, this new collagen membrane was associated
      with a sufficient width of newly formed attached gingiva with coverage of Miller class-I and
      class-II recession defects. These results suggest that the use of Mucograft® TM in
      periodontal plastic surgery may provide a viable source of grafting material as an
      alternative to autogenous and non-autogenous soft tissue graft materials.

      This study is a clinical and radiographic, randomized parallel arm comparative evaluation of
      the addition of Mucograft® seal to FDBA in the ridge preservation procedure. Group A will
      receive FDBA and a CS. Group B will receive FDBA with Mucograft® seal.

          -  Be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Have unsalvageable non-adjacent non-molar teeth scheduled for extraction: maxillary
             incisors, canines, and premolars, and mandibular canines and premolars that require
             an extraction with ridge preservation planned for delayed implant placement. If a
             subject has multiple teeth to be extracted, only one tooth will be included in the
             study.

          -  Presence of buccal plate at the extraction site as determined by first sectional CBCT
             scan.

             Medicine (TUSDM) periodontology clinic to receive ridge preservation and meet all
             medical and dental requirements of the TUSDM periodontology clinic for periodontal
             surgery (e.g., subjects with no diseases or medication allergies contraindicating
             periodontal surgery).

          -  Display no evidence of acute periodontal infection: e.g., abscess, suppuration,
             severe swelling and/or spontaneous bleeding.

             the patient to be treatment planned for the procedures in the TUSDM periodontology
             clinic (e.g., severe anemia, low white blood cell count, bleeding or coagulation
             disorder, uncontrolled hypertension (150/90), recent myocardial infarction (within 6
             months of enrollment), diabetes (HbA1C ≥7%), HIV/AIDS (self-reported), history of or
             currently undergoing head and neck radiation, history of or currently taking
             bisphosphonates, endocrine-induced bone diseases (e.g. hyperparathyroidism),

             clinic guidelines elective surgical procedures and radiographs/CBCT scans are usually
             postponed until after delivery).

          -  Any known allergy/hypersensitivity to FDBA (contains trace amount of gentamicin,
             providone-iodine), CS or Mucograft® seal.

          -  Any known allergy to yeast.

          -  Have untreated acute infection at surgical site.

          -  Have untreated malignant neoplasm.

          -  Individuals opposed to having porcine derived materials placed in their mouth due to
             any personal reasons such as religious reasons.

          -  Teeth requiring flap reflection for extraction, e.g. deep subgingival caries or
             fractures.
