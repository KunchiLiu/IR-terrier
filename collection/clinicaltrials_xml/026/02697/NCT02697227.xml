      The goal of this research study is learn if Behavioral Activation Treatment (BATS) or Health
      Education/Smoking Cessation counseling (HE), combined with the nicotine patch, can help
      people with different types of emotion and attention levels quit smoking.

      Participant will be allowed to choose how they would like to receive study-related
      communications (such as text messages, email, phone call, or in person) about visit
      reminders and study letters. Participant will be told about which methods are secured and
      which are not. If participant chooses to receive communications by an unsecured method, they
      will need to sign a consent document to confirm their preference. If participant does not
      wish to sign the communication consent form, they will automatically receive their
      communications in a secure manner (such as telephone call, encrypted email, or in-person).

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be randomly
      assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one
      knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. Participant
      will have an equal chance of being assigned to Group 1 or 2.

        -  If participant is in Group 1, they will receive an active nicotine patch and BATS
           counseling, which focuses on helping to increase rewarding experiences while quitting
           smoking.

        -  If participant is in Group 2, they will receive an active nicotine patch and Health
           Education/ Smoking Cessation counseling, which focuses on coping strategies for not
           smoking and related health issues.

      Participant will not know which group they are assigned to.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Participant will start using their nicotine patches on their scheduled quit day, which is
      about 4 weeks from the beginning of the study (the day before Visit 4).

      Participant should apply the nicotine patch to the upper arm. Participant should put it in a
      slightly different place each day to avoid skin irritation. Participant may take the patch
      off at night to avoid sleeping problems.

      Participant will be given a study diary to record how many cigarettes they smoke (if any)
      each day while they are on study.

      Participant must return their study diary and any unused study patches at Visit 9.

      Study Visits (Visits 1-9):

      At Visit 1:

        -  Urine will be collected for a routine test to check participant's nicotine, cotinine
           and anabasine levels. Cotinine is a chemical released in participant's body when it
           breaks down nicotine and will show whether and how much they have recently smoked.
           Anabasine is used to show if nicotine is found in the urine due to a nicotine
           replacement therapy or from tobacco use.

        -  Participant's CO level and weight will be measured.

        -  Participant will also perform tasks related to smoking behavior that will take 45
           minutes.

      At every study visit:

        -  Participant will complete questionnaires about several topics, including depression,
           suicide, their smoking behavior, and any side effects from the study patch. These
           questionnaires should take about 45-60 minutes in total to complete.

        -  Participant will receive counseling about quitting smoking, where they will talk about
           possible &quot;triggers&quot; for smoking and strategies for dealing with quitting smoking. These
           sessions will take about 45 minutes each. These sessions may be audiotaped.

      During counseling on Visit 1, participant will set a &quot;quit date&quot; for stopping smoking, about
      3 weeks later. Participant should not quit smoking before the quit date. Participant may
      also set goals to reduce their smoking before that point. Participant should try to stay
      smoke-free after the quit date. Participant will also be given a drug instruction sheet, a
      card with emergency contact information, and a participant manual to help participant follow
      along with the topics discussed during counseling.

      Lab Session:

      Participant will take part in a lab session at or before Visit 1 to test their brain
      activity. Participant will be asked to watch a series of slides. The slides will include
      pictures of people, nature, and artwork. Slides showing nude people, medical procedures, and
      victims of car crashes will also be shown. Participant will be shown examples of these
      slides before beginning the procedure and given the opportunity to withdraw from the study
      at that point.

      During the lab session, participant's brain electrical activity will be checked with an
      electroencephalogram (EEG). To do this, small sensors will be placed on participant's scalp
      and face. Participant should not drink more than 2 cups of coffee or other caffeinated
      drinks for at least 2Â½ hours before the session. At the lab session, participant may be
      asked to smoke a cigarette if the doctor thinks it is needed for them to show their normal
      smoking behavior.

      Participant will also complete computer tasks, including questionnaires that will measure
      their emotions and attention level. These tasks should take about 90 minutes to complete.

      The lab session may last up to 2 hours total.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant will receive the nicotine patch for up to 8 weeks. Participant will be taken off
      study early if the study staff thinks it is in their best interest or if they are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits (Visits 9 and
      10, below).

      End-of-Treatment Visit (Visit 9):

      After participant has finished using the nicotine patch, the following tests and procedures
      will be performed:

        -  Participant's CO level will be measured.

        -  Urine will be collected to measure participant's cotinine and anabasine levels.

        -  Participant will complete the same questionnaires they completed at the regular study
           visits.

      Follow-Up Visit (Visit 10):

      At about 3 months after participant has stopped smoking, the following tests and procedures
      will be performed:

        -  Participant's CO level will be measured.

        -  Urine will be collected to measure participant's cotinine and anabasine levels.

        -  Participant will complete the same questionnaires they completed at the regular study
           visits.

      This is an investigational study. The nicotine patch is FDA approved and commercially
      available to help people stop smoking.

      Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this portion of the study. All will take part at
      MD Anderson.
