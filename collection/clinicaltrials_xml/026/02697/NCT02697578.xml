    <textblock>
      In hemodialysis patients, deviations of serum concentration of calcium, phosphate or
      parathyroid hormone from the values recommended by KDIGO are associated to a negative
      outcome. The regulation of calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone is complex and each
      parameter is not independently regulated. In hemodialysis patient's simultaneous
      modification in these three parameters are the result of abnormal mineral metabolism and the
      treatment used to correct these abnormalities that usually produce changes in more than one
      parameter. The specific objective of this work is an accurate and exhaustive analysis and
      description of the complex relationships between clinically relevant parameters in chronic
      kidney disease metabolism bone disease. In order to achieve these objectives we have used a
      machine learning approach Random Forest able to extract useful knowledge from a large
      database. The analysis of the complex interactions between the different parameters needs an
      advance mathematical approach such as Random Forest . The second aim of this study is to
      determine whether calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone, Fibroblast growth factor 23
      and calcitriol are long-term associated with demographic features, mortality, co-morbidity
      and the therapy prescribed. Compare the predictions obtained with conventional statistical
      analysis versus the new model analysis based on artificial intelligence. Our preliminary
      results suggest that there are interactions between some parameters that are strong enough
      to question whether the evaluation of a given therapy can be based in the measurement of one
      single parameter. Subsequently, we will analyze in a prospective study on incident patients,
      whether the use of this new model may predict the cardiovascular risk and reduce the therapy
      cost.
