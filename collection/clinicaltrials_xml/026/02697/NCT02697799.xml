  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a multicenter, randomized clinical trial of attitudes towards research participation, we
      will evaluate the ethics, effectiveness, and cost- effectiveness of three recruitment
      strategies for research participation in a large randomized controlled trial comparing two
      types of radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome is the proportion of people assigned to each recruitment strategy that consent to participate in the parent RCT, a radiation therapy study for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate- Several Days</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitudes towards research</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate</time_frame>
    <description>Attitudes towards research will be measured using the Research Attitudes Questionnaire-7 (RAQ-7). Originally designed with 11 items, a shorter 7-item version (RAQ-7) has been shown to have improved internal consistency and factorial validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attention to informed consent</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the amount of time patients spend reading each part of the radiation therapy consent form. On-site research coordinators will facilitate the collection of this data as patients read the document via the recruitment strategy study's electronic database.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived risks of the research</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived risks of the research will be measured by the 9-item compared riskiness scale, which assesses perceptions of research risk. Using this approach, patients compare their assessment of the riskiness of the RCT to other salient and more commonly encountered risks. Such comparative assessments have been shown to be less susceptible to errors in scale calibration than isolated ratings of risks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of therapeutic misconceptions</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess patients' ability to distinguish research from individualized patient care by measuring rates of therapeutic misconception across recruitment strategies among patients considering participation in the radiation therapy study. We will assess this outcome with a 4-item tool developed by Dr. Scott Kim, which has been used for similar purposes in several research contexts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Understanding of the trial</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate</time_frame>
    <description>To assess whether increased attention translates into improved understanding of the radiation therapy trial, we will use a 6-item Trial Elements Quiz, featuring core elements of the radiation therapy trial's consent form.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceptions of influence or coercion</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate</time_frame>
    <description>To measure general perception of coercion and voluntariness of research participation, we will use the five-item Perceived Coercion Scale of the MacArthur Admission Experience Survey. The true/false scale is tailored to measure patients' perceptions of coercion in the inpatient psychiatric treatment admission process; we have edited the wording to make it relevant to participation in the radiation therapy study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Care System Distrust</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate-Several Days</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the revised Health Care System Distrust Scale to measure for evidence of health system or physician distrust among patients participating in the radiation therapy study. This 9-item revised scale measures a multi-dimensional construct of health care system distrust and encapsulates the domains of values and competence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention through the end of treatment sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the impact of the recruitment strategies on retention status in the protocol of the radiation therapy study.</description>
