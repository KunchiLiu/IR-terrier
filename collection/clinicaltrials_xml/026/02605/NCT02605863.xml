    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of androgen deprivation therapy through
      administration of enzalutamide on preventing bladder cancer recurrences in patients with
      non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

      -  A blood draw and an electrocardiogram (EKG). The blood draw will check levels of
           testosterone, dihydro-testosterone, estradiol, and Vitamin D. Pre-study blood-work will
           also include a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP/CHEM8) and liver
           function test (LFT) if any of these labs were not drawn within 1 month prior to the
           transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT).

        -  Bladder tumor sample that is stored in the Department of Pathology will have additional
           tests run on it to confirm study eligibility and to test for certain cell markers.

        -  After 1 month following the original TURBT, subjects will begin therapy with
           enzalutamide. The study drug will be administered orally at a dose of 160mg daily for
           12 months.

        -  Subjects will be monitored for adverse reactions or side effects from enzalutamide at
           scheduled office visits.

        -  If the bladder tumor is classified as being &quot;intermediate risk&quot;, regularly scheduled
           office visits will occur at 2 months post-operatively (i.e., 1 month after starting
           enzalutamide), and then again at post-operative months 3, 6, 9 and 12, as is part of
           the usual standard of care.

        -  If the bladder tumor is classified as being &quot;high risk&quot; and the subject receives BCG
           therapy, then the office visits will occur on a slightly different schedule to conform
           to the standard of care for this type of disease. Subjects in this group typically
           start their intravesical BCG instillations 4-6 weeks post-operatively. Therefore, the
           subjects will be seen approximately 1 month following the initial TURBT, and will begin
           therapy with enzalutamide at that time, as described above. Subjects will be on study
           drug at least 7 days prior to the initiation of BCG therapy, which will occur once a
           week for 6 weeks. Similar to the subjects in the intermediate risk group, the subjects
           receiving BCG will also be seen 1 month after initiation of enzalutamide therapy to
           ensure there are no adverse reactions to the study drug. Following this visit, they
           will be seen again at the time of the post-BCG cystoscopy, which occurs 1 month after
           your 6th instillation. Subjects will be seen again at the 3, 6, 9 and 12-month post-BCG
           cystoscopy office visits, as part of routine care.

        -  Repeat blood work (CBC, BMP and LFTs) will be checked 1 month after starting
           enzalutamide (approximately 2 months post-operatively). For subjects with intermediate
           risk bladder cancer, these labs will be checked again at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
           post-operatively (as per the regularly scheduled office visits). For the high risk
           patients receiving BCG therapy, these labs will be checked again at the 1, 3, 6 and
           9-month post-BCG office visits (per the regularly scheduled office visits for these
           patients).

        -  An EKG will be obtained at baseline (before starting the study drug), but will also be
           re-checked at approximately 6 months (half-way through therapy with enzalutamide) to
           ensure there are no signs of worsening cardiac disease while on the study drug.

        -  A cystoscopy will be done every 3 months as part of the standard of care for bladder
           cancer follow-up. Lesions suspicious for tumor recurrence will be biopsied as per usual
           standard of care. If a recurrence is documented, subjects will discontinue use of
           enzalutamide.

        -  For subjects scheduled to undergo therapy with BCG, additional tests will be run on the
           urine samples that subjects will already be providing in the Urology office as part of
           the standard of care.

             enrollment.

          4. Subjects whose tumors are AR(+) as well as AR(-) will be included, but we will
             restrict inclusion of AR(-) subjects so that they represent no more than 1/3 of the
             total study population, or any single cohort (ie. the intermediate or high-risk
             groups).

          5. Subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to 2 acceptable forms of birth
             control.

             will be ineligible.

         13. Subjects with neutropenia will be ineligible.

         14. Subjects with clinical hypogonadism, those on androgen replacement therapy, or those
             with prostate cancer or other diseases treated with various forms of hormonal therapy
             (not including 5-alpha reductase inhibitors) will also be ineligible for study
             enrollment.

         15. Subjects who have undergone therapy for any malignancy within the past 5 years except
