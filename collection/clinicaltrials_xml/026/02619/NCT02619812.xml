      To understand the mechanisms associated with diarrhea in patients receiving conditioning
      chemotherapy prior to autologous stem cell transplantation and to test the effects of the
      studied therapies on mechanisms that may be involved in the pathophysiology of diarrhea
      associated with conditioning chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of SBI, colesevelam, and
      placebo in patients undergoing autologous HSCT for the clinical care of multiple myeloma.

      The number of adults undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has grown
      significantly over the past two decades as a result of the availability of therapies for
      advanced hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, and the broader selection criteria for
      eligibility to receive these transplants. Generally, the stem cell transplant procedure
      consists of administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to ablate all residual
      malignancy (called conditioning therapy), followed by intravenous infusion of hematopoietic
      stem cells to restore bone marrow function. Generally, HSCT has a positive effect on
      survival, despite serious adverse effects and life-threatening complications.

      Diarrhea can affect up to 91% of patients receiving autologous or allogeneic HSCT and is
      identified by 9% of the patients as the single most debilitating adverse effect post-HSCT.
      Other commonly encountered symptoms are nausea and vomiting (13%) and mouth sores (42%). The
      impact of diarrhea can be significant and result in dehydration, negative impact on quality
      of life, prolonged hospitalization with an increased cost and risk, and the diarrhea may be
      potentially life-threatening.
