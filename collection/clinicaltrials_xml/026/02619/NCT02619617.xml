      The purpose of this non-confirmatory study is to determine if SOM230 has adequate efficacy
      and safety to warrant further clinical development in cluster headache (CH). This study will
      have two parts. Part A will be a parallel design SOM230 vs. Placebo, and following an
      observed signal in Part A at an interim analysis, Part B of the study will be a comparison
      of SOM230 to sumatriptan.
