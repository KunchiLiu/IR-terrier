  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many chemotherapy and radiation-containing regimens for cancer or prior to bone marrow
      transplantation can cause sterility in children and young adults. In addition, some human
      disease conditions (e.g., Klinefelter's) are associated with infertility. Semen
      cryopreservation is available as a fertility-preserving option for post pubertal boys and
      adult men, but many do not take advantage of this option due in part to lack of information,
      illness, and/or time constraints relative to their treatment plan. Currently, no
      fertility-preserving options are available for prepubescent boys who are not yet producing
      sperm. The primary objective of the proposed study is to 1) Optimize techniques for
      cryopreserving testicular tissue, 2) Assess malignant contamination in testicular tissues
      and 3) develop methods to enrich spermatogonial stem cells and remove malignant
      contamination from testicular tissue. In addition, this study will process and cryopreserve
      tissue and/or cells for participating patients as a resource for future elective procedures
      to attempt fertility restoration.

      This study will provide a pool of research tissue that will be used to develop and test
      methods for manipulation and cryopreservation of testicular tissue. Progress in these
      investigations may open up a range of new fertility preservation techniques to patients that
      currently have no options. At the same time, a substantial portion of the patient's tissue
      will be cryopreserved and reserved for his own future use.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Males scheduled to undergo surgery, chemotherapy, drug treatment and/or radiation for the
        treatment or prevention of a medical condition or malignancy with risk of causing
        permanent and complete loss of subsequent testicular function.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male age 30 days (non-inclusive) to 39 years (inclusive).

          2. Scheduled to undergo surgery, chemotherapy, drug treatment and/or radiation for the
             treatment or prevention of a medical condition or malignancy with risk of causing
             permanent and complete loss of subsequent testicular function.

          3. Have a medical condition or malignancy that requires removal of all or part of one or
             both testicles.

          4. Have newly diagnosed or recurrent disease. Those who were not enrolled at the time of
             initial diagnosis (i.e., patients with recurrent disease) are eligible if they have
             not previously received therapy that is viewed as likely to result in complete and
             permanent loss of testicular function.

          5. Have two testicles if undergoing elective removal of a testicle for fertility
             preservation only. Note: removal of both testicles will limit fertility preservation
             options.

          6. Sign an approved informed consent and authorization permitting the release of
             personal health information. The patient and/or the patient's legally authorized
             guardian must acknowledge in writing that consent for specimen collection has been
             obtained, in accordance with institutional policies approved by the U.S. Department
             of Health and Human Services.

          7. Consent for serum screening tests for infectious diseases [HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis B,
             hepatitis C, RDR (syphilis), CMV, HLTV-1, and HTLV-2], to be performed at the time of
             testicular tissue harvesting.

          8. Undergo a full history and physical examination and obtain standard pre-operative
             clearance (based on the most recent ACC/AHA Guideline for Perioperative
             Cardiovascular Evaluation for Noncardiac Surgery) as determined by their primary
             surgeon.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed with psychological, psychiatric, or other conditions which prevent giving
             fully informed consent.

          2. Diagnosed with an underlying medical condition that significantly increases their
             risk of complications from anesthesia and surgery.
