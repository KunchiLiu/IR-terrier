    <measure>Change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ DI) score at week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ DI is a patient-reported questionnaire to assess functioning impacted by RA. It includes the categories of dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. It asks patients about the amount of difficulty they experience in these activities as well as the use of aids and/or devices. The HAQ also has a numeric rating scale (NRS) (13) to assess pain on a scale from 0 to 10.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) domain scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a patient-reported questionnaire of patient health related QoL. It measures generic health concepts relevant across age, disease, and treatment groups. There are 36 items in total and the recall period is the last 4 weeks. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in EuroQol 5 dimension, 3 level quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L measures the patient's overall health state in a descriptive system of health-related QoL states consisting of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which can take one of three responses. The responses record three levels of severity ('no problems', 'some problems', and 'extreme problems) within a particular EQ-5D-3L dimension. In addition, a visual analogue scale (VAS) rates current health state between 0-10 The EQ-5D-3L results can be converted to health utility scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI is a patient-reported questionnaire to measure work and activity impairment during the past seven days. It determines employment status, hours missed from work due to the disease (i.e. RA), hours missed from work for other reasons, hours actually worked, the degree to which the disease affected work productivity while at work and the degree to which the disease affected activities outside of work. Additional questions around employment status will be incorporated into the survey.</description>
