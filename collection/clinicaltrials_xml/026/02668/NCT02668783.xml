  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the etonogestrel (ENG) + 17β-estradiol (E2) vaginal
      ring's efficacy compared to a placebo vaginal ring in the treatment of dysmenorrhea at
      Treatment Cycle 2. In addition, this study will assess the safety and tolerability of the
      ENG-E2 vaginal rings. Primary hypothesis: Relative to the placebo ring, the ENG-E2 vaginal
      ring results in a greater proportion of participants with a ≥3 point reduction in peak
      pelvic pain score and no increase in the number of rescue pain relief (ibuprofen) tablets
      taken at Treatment Cycle 2 as compared to baseline.
