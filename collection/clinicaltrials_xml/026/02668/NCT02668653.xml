  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-control global study. The purpose of
      this study is to compare the effect of quizartinib versus placebo (administered with
      standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy, then administered as maintenance therapy
      for up to 12 cycles) on event-free survival in subjects with FLT3-ITD positive AML.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2 (at Screening);

             FLT3-ITD/total FLT3);

          6. Subject is receiving standard &quot;7+3&quot; induction chemotherapy regimen as specified in
             the protocol;

          7. Adequate renal function defined as:

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN); or

               -  Glomerular filtration rate &gt;50 mL/min/1.73m2, as calculated with the modified
                  Cockcroft Gault equation;

          8. Adequate hepatic function defined as:

               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN;

               -  Serum alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase ≤2.5
                  × ULN;

          9. Serum electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) within normal limits. If
             outside of normal limits, subject will be eligible when electrolytes are corrected;

         10. If female, must be either postmenopausal (no menstrual period for a minimum of 12
             months), surgically sterile, or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test upon entry into this study and must be willing to use maximally
             effective double-barrier birth control during the period of therapy and contraception
             for 3 months following the last investigational drug dose;

         11. If male, must be surgically sterile or willing to use an effective double-barrier
             contraception method upon enrollment, during the course of the study, and for 3

                  relevant arrhythmias while using the pacemaker);

             hepatitis C)

         11. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subjects should be tested for
             HIV prior to randomization if required by local regulations or EC;

         12. History of hypersensitivity to any excipients in the quizartinib/placebo tablets;
