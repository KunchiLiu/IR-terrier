      Thus is a longitudinal, prospective, multicentric observational study performed in mainland
      France, among a sample of gynaecology surgeons practising at endometriosis &quot;expert&quot; centres.

      The aim of this study is to describe, under real treatment conditions in patients suffering
      from endometriosis, the impact of the use of anti-adhesion treatment during celioscopy
      surgery on the development of clinical signs in the patients and their fertility at one
      year.
