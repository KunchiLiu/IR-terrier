      The primary objective of the study is to assess the long-term safety of dupilumab in
      pediatric patients with AD.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess the long-term efficacy of dupilumab in pediatric patients with AD

        -  To assess the trough concentrations of functional dupilumab in serum and the
           immunogenicity in pediatric patients with AD after re-treatment with dupilumab.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, ≥6 to &lt;18 years of age at the time of screening

          2. Participated in a prior dupilumab study in pediatric patients with AD and adequately
             completed the visits and assessments required for both the treatment and follow-up
             periods, as defined in the prior study protocol

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who, during their participation in a prior dupilumab study in pediatric
             patients with AD, developed a serious adverse event (SAE) potentially related to the
             study drug any adverse event (AE) that led to permanent study drug discontinuation in
             the prior dupilumab study, except if the AE was worsening AD, or if the patient
             received placebo (if known)

          2. Patients, who during their participation in a prior dupilumab study in pediatric
             patients with AD, developed an AE that was deemed related to dupilumab and led to
             study treatment discontinuation, which in the opinion of the investigator or of the
             medical monitor could indicate that continued treatment with dupilumab may present an
             unreasonable risk for the patient

          3. Treatment with an investigational drug, other than dupilumab, within 8 weeks or
             within 5 half-lives (if known), whichever is longer, before the baseline visit

          4. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          5. Known or suspected immunosuppression

          6. Recent infections requiring antiinfectious treatment

          7. Recent history or high risk of clinical endoparasitoses

          8. High risk populations (low life expectancy, severe concomitant diseases, etc.)

          9. Pregnant or breast-feeding women

         10. Patients of reproductive potential and sexually active who are unwilling to use
             adequate contraception

         11. Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine within 12 weeks before the baseline visit
