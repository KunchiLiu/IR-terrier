    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics, establish a
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimen, and to assess the preliminary efficacy of
      JNJ-61186372 in participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      This open label (all participants know the identity of the study drug), multicenter (more
      than one study site), first-in-human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation
      and Part 2 is a dose expansion cohort. In Part 1, participants with evaluable non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) will be enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of JNJ-61186372,
      which will be administered in 28 day treatment cycles. The dose will be escalated until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD, or maximum administered dose [MAD], if no MTD is found) is
      reached. Part 1 will follow a traditional 3+3 design. At each dose level, 3 participants
      will complete Cycle 1. If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in these 3 participants,
      then escalation will continue in a new cohort of 3 participants. Data from Part 1 will be
      used to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In Part 2, participants with
      documented epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and measurable disease, whose
      disease has progressed during treatment with a marketed EGFR inhibitor, will be enrolled and
      receive JNJ-61186372 at the RP2D determined in Part 1. For both parts, the study consists of
      3 periods: a Screening period (up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug); a
      Treatment period (first dose of study drug until the last dose of study drug); and a Follow
      Up period (through 30 days after the last dose). Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
