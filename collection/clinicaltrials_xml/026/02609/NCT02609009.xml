      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) affects 2 - 3% of children and adolescents older than
      10 years and is of unknown cause. It was initially thought that back pain (BP) occurrence
      was similar to the one encounter in healthy adolescents. Recently though, literature has
      shown that BP seems to occur twice as often than in a healthy adolescent's. As such, BP
      appears as a condition that might have detrimental effect on the well-being of that
      population, and, as the investigators know, is associated with increases in healthcare
      costs. Of interest, BP in adolescents would appear to be a predictive factor for adult BP.
      Is vertebral manipulation (VM) a viable alternative? Since 2006, four guidelines were in
      agreement as to the value of that approach with acute or chronic BP in adults.
      Unfortunately, no study was found in adolescents. The purpose of the investigators study is
      to verify if VM is efficacious at improving AIS patients' back pain and to find out if it
      can help these patients to obtain a better quality of life and improve their spinal
      flexibility. Recruitment will take place at the Ste-Justine's hospital where patients will
      have 2 evaluations, conducted by an independent orthopaedist (baseline and 4 weeks).
      Patients will be allocated to either the experimental (VM) or the usual medical care group.
      Spinal manipulation treatment will spin over a 4-week period. The investigators study will
      be the first trial evaluating the efficacy of vertebral manipulation in adolescent
      idiopathic scoliosis patients with back pain. Finally, no other study was found on available
      and effective treatment in regard to back pain management of this population. A
      well-structured trial is needed to provide clinicians with a better understanding and best
      evidence regarding treatment protocols.

      Introduction Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is defined by the Scoliosis Research
      Society (SRS) has a three-dimensional deviation of the vertebral column of unknown origin
      appearing in adolescents older than 10 years. Chronic non-specific back pain (CNSBP) is
      often associated with adolescent scoliosis patients and the associated prevalence is almost
      double that of non-scoliosis healthy adolescents. Furthermore, CNSBP seems to be a predictor
      of CNSBP in adulthood.

      Few studies evaluated BP among AIS patients and in those who did, conflicting results,
      regarding back pain prevalence, were observed. Among these, only two studies looked at back
      pain and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Ramirez et al. retrospectively evaluated , 2442
      scoliosis adolescent patients' files establishing BP prevalence at 32%. He concluded that
      the established prevalence was similar to the one encountered in a general non-scoliotic
      adolescent population. Joncas and Labelle prospectively evaluated 239 adolescents with an
      idiopathic scoliosis for prevalence of BP. They observed that BP was present in 54% of
      patients, and the average pain intensity was 49,4 mm. More recently, Sato's looked back pain
      prevalence in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. He conducted a large-scale
      cross-sectional epidemiological study, where 43 630 children aged 9 to 15-year-old were
      asked to complete a take-home questionnaire. They reported a back pain prevalence of 58.8%
      in scoliosis patients compared to 32.9% in non-scoliosis patients.

      In regards to BP Management in AIS Patients, a comprehensive review of the literature did
      not yield any study on BP management in AIS patients. Spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) is a
      recognized and safe therapy for low back pain and is performed primarily by chiropractors,
      physical therapists, and osteopaths. To the best of the investigators knowledge, only one
      pilot clinical trial has been conducted among children and adolescents even if
      musculoskeletal disorders are the most frequent condition treated, in this population, by
      chiropractors. This pilot trial reported only a few minor adverse events though 120 spinal
      manipulations were delivered and curve progression was not reported in the intervention
      group.

      In light of the paucity of literature on the management of back pain in nonsurgical AIS
      patients and considering the lack of evidence with regards to the efficacy of SMT for back
      pain in adolescents, and the lack of guidance regarding management of back pain in
      adolescents, it would be important to evaluate the effectiveness of SMT compared to usual
      medical care for back pain among adolescents with idiopathic nonsurgical scoliosis.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to verify the effect of Spinal Manipulative
      Therapy on back pain management of adolescents with idiopathic nonsurgical scoliosis. The
      secondary objectives are two-fold: 1) to verify the effect of SMT on low back function, 2)
      to verify the feasibility and acceptability of SMT according to patients' level of
      satisfaction. This pilot study will also serve to verify some implementation strategies
      before proceeding to a subsequent larger trial such as the recruitment rate, the treatment
      compliance and loss to follow up, and adverse event occurrences (appendix E).

      Methods: Study Design This pilot study is a prospective single centre randomized controlled
      trial with one experimental and one control group. This study will be recruiting from the
      Ste-Justine University Hospital in Montreal, Canada, and patients will be required to attend
      at least 80% of the treatment sessions otherwise they will be considered as non-compliant.
      Chiropractors will be recruited from their professional regulatory board. Different
      questionnaires and instruments will be employed during this trial: questionnaires; the Brief
      Pain Inventory Questionnaire, and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire; Instruments:
      the modified Fingertip-to-floor distance, the modified-modified Schöber test, and the
      Biering-Sorenson back muscles extensor test. Patients will be evaluated upon trial entry and
      at 4 weeks (end of trial). Any co-interventions will be documented and accounted in the
      analysis. Eligible patients will be randomized according to blocks of 4 to either the
      experimental (SMT) or the control (UMC) arm after informed consent has been obtained. The
      randomization list will be generated and managed by an independent statistician. Statistical
      software SPSS version 22 will be used for data analyses. All analyses will be conducted
      under the intention-to-treat principle. To ensure balance, groups will be compared with
      respect to possible confounders (age, gender, brace etc.) at baseline. Means (Std.
      Deviation) and frequencies will be presented by the group. Tests will be 2-tailed and the
      significance level will be set at 0.05. Statistical analysis will include t-test (or
      Mann-Whitney) for continuous variables and χ2 for categorical variables. Considering that
      patient's inclusion criterion is chronic pain, and that by definition, chronic pain is
      defined as constant over a period of time; the investigators expect this variable not to be
      time influenced. Ste-Justine University Hospital ethical committee has approved this study.
