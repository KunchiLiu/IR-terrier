  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional, 6-month post-marketing study is designed to evaluate the change in
      diabetes-related distress among parents/caregivers of school-age children and adolescents
      with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who are receiving multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy.
      Investigational sites will be assigned using cluster randomization, with approximately 10 to
      20 children at each site. In order to maintain a true control group for comparison, the
      investigational sites will be randomly assigned to the Accu-Chek(R) Connect diabetes
      management system (DMS) or usual care/continued use of current DMS devices.
