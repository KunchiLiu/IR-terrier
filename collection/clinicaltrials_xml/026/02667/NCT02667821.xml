    <textblock>
      The Investigators are performing a study to determine, in patients with chronic/recurrent
      neck pain, the cerebrovascular hemodynamic consequences of cervical spine movements,
      including manipulation, in vivo using fMRI technology on vertebral and cranial blood flow
      dynamics affecting brain perfusion, and extend the current data set on these variables

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to further investigate in patients with chronic/recurrent neck
      pain, the cerebrovascular hemodynamic consequences of cervical spine positions, including
      manipulation, in vivo under clinically relevant circumstances using two advanced MRI
      technology on the vertebral and posterior cerebral and cerebellar blood flow dynamics
      affecting brain perfusion. According to the knowledge of the investigators, a study
      utilizing MRI and functional blood oxygen level dependent (fBOLD) imaging to examine blood
      flow and perfusion, turbulence and evidence of micro-trauma within these blood vessels has
      yet to be conducted.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in blood flow through the vertebral artery and posterior cerebral and cerebellar circulation will be assessed using phase contrast MRI.</measure>
    <time_frame>The series of fMRI sequences will be performed on each participant immediately after each condition. Through study completion, data will be presented after an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Phase contrast MRI provides additional velocity measurements that can be used for analysis of the blood flow and tissue motion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in tissue perfusion in the posterior cerebrum and cerebellum will be assessed using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI technique.</measure>
    <time_frame>The series of ASL sequences will be performed on each participant immediately after each condition. Through study completion, data will be presented after an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>ASL allows one to separate the blood flow from the BOLD effect, thus giving clear measures of perfusion. More specifically ASL will be used to measure blood perfusion and allow extraction of metabolic difference from flow differences in BOLD imaging. It is a quantitative technique, yielding values with units of ml/(100g of tissue)·min-1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in tissue oxygenation in the posterior cerebrum and cerebellum will be assessed using fMRI BOLD technique.</measure>
    <time_frame>The series of fMRI BOLD sequences will be performed on each participant immediately after each condition. Through study completion, data will be presented after an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Using fMRI BOLD changes in the microvascular ratio of oxyhaemoglobin (oxyHb) to deoxyhaemoglobin (deoxyHb) will be measured in regions of interest above the vertebral artery. The changes are typically observed in T2*-weighted functional MRI scans which are sensitive to blood volume, hematocrit, and oxygenation BOLD contrast. Functional images will be acquired with the following parameters: 24-cm field of view, 5 mm thick, TE/TR = 35 ms/2sec, 1 NEX.</description>

    <description>Participants included in the experimental arm will be adults aged 18 years and older with chronic/recurrent neck pain Grade II averaging &gt; 30% by Neck Disability Index (NDI) over the prior week who have been prescribed cervical manipulation for treatment of their condition. Each participant will undergo three separate test maneuvers consistent with prior work completed at the St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton Brain Body Institute. Each participant will begin with neutral cervical spine as a standard natural control, followed by block randomization between maximum voluntary rotation of the cervical spine and one cervical manipulation. Please see Intervention section for a detailed description.</description>

    <intervention_name>Head positions and spinal manipulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Each participant will undergo three separate test maneuvers. Neutral (0° rotation) neck position (condition 1) will be followed by block randomization between maximum voluntary rotation (condition 2) and a high-velocity-low-amplitude cervical manipulation targeted at C1-C2 (condition 3). Conditions 1 and 2 will be held for 1 minute before returning to neutral alignment. For the manipulation, the head will be repositioned at neutrality immediate. An experienced practitioner will perform the manipulation on the adjustable and pivotal MRI bed. After each condition, MRI of the upper neck and cerebrum for perfusion and blood flow will ensue. Venous blood samples will be obtained by a professional certified in venipuncture on the day of and two days following the experimental maneuvers.</description>
