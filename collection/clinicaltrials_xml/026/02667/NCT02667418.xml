      The purpose of this study is to determine whether fidaxomicin and vancomycin followed by
      taper and pulse vancomycin treatment are superior to standard vancomycin treatment for the
      treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of healthcare-associated infectious diarrhea
      among adults in industrialized countries. In addition to diarrhea, C. difficile infection
      (CDI) may also result in serious complications such as shock, toxic megacolon, colectomy,
      and death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated C. difficile
      results in 250,000 hospital infections, 14,000 deaths, and $1 billion in excess costs
      annually. Recurrent CDI is the most challenging clinical dilemma facing clinicians who treat
      this disease. An estimated 30% of patients who respond to initial treatment with either
      vancomycin or metronidazole develop recurrent CDI, usually within 1-4 weeks of completing
      treatment.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether 1) standard fidaxomicin
      treatment and 2) standard vancomycin treatment followed by taper and pulse vancomycin
      treatment are superior to standard vancomycin treatment alone for sustained clinical
      response at day 59 for all treatments, for participants with either their first or second
      recurrence of CDI. Veterans presenting with a first or second CDI recurrence will be
      screened, consented and randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to one of three treatment
      groups: 1) a 10 day course of oral vancomycin (VAN-TX), 2) a 10 day course of fidaxomicin
      (FID-TX) or 3) a 31 day course of vancomycin which includes a taper and pulse following
      daily treatment (VAN-TP/P). Symptom resolution is defined as an improvement or resolution of
      diarrhea (&lt;3 unformed bowel movements over 24 hours) for 48 consecutive hours compared to
      the participant's baseline. Recurrence is defined as having diarrhea (&gt;3 loose or
      semi-formed stools over 24 hours for 48 consecutive hours). A sample size of 546 randomized
      study participants is required to obtain at least 82% power to detect a 16% absolute
      difference (expected proportion of 31% in the VAN-TX group) in sustained clinical response
      (D- COM) proportion 1) between the FID-TX group and the VAN-TX group and 2) between the
      VAN-TP/P group and VAN-TX group at the 0.05 significance level. The study is expected to
      complete enrollment in 4 years with 90 days of follow-up. Twenty four sites, including 6
      pilot sites, will be required to enroll approximately 0.6 participants per month (7 every
      year), or 21 participants per site (28 participants per pilot site) over 4 years (546
      participants total). This assumes that 30% of Veterans with CDI have a recurrence and 20% of
      them will enroll in the study.

    <description>The Primary outcome will be sustained clinical response as measured at study day 59 for all treatment regimens. Sustained clinical response is a composite outcome that includes symptom resolution during treatment without any of the following (as assessed on day 59):
Diarrhea recurrence
Other non-fatal clinical events including severe abdominal pain, toxic megacolon (where diarrhea ceases but is not a beneficial outcome), and colectomy
Death</description>

    <measure>CDI Composite outcome measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 59 for all treatment regimens.</time_frame>
    <description>CDI Composite Outcome Measure (CDI-COM) is sustained clinical response without recurrent CDI (defined as diarrhea plus confirmation of toxigenic C. difficile or its toxins in stool) as measured at study day 59 for all three treatment regimens. Sustained response will be defined using the same composite endpoint criteria as were used in the D-COM outcome but without recurrent CDI on or before day 59.</description>
