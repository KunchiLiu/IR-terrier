  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meta-analyses indicate beneficial effects of cognitive training and cognitively challenging
      video games on cognition. However, cognitive effects of solving jigsaw puzzles - a popular,
      visuospatial cognitive leisure activity - have not been investigated, yet. Thus, the primary
      aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of solving jigsaw puzzles on visuospatial
      cognition. As secondary aims, effects on psychological outcomes (self-efficacy, perceived
      stress, well-being) and visuospatial everyday functioning (instrumental activities of daily
      living and self-reported cognitive failures in everyday life) are examined.
