    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given
      together with rituximab-ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide (R-ICE) and how well they work in
      treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has returned after a period of
      improvement and that has not responded to previous treatment. Biological therapies, such as
      lenalidomide, may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer
      cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as R-ICE, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving lenalidomide with R-ICE may be a better
      treatment for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the addition of lenalidomide to
      the R-ICE chemoimmunotherapy regimen
      (lenalidomide-rituximab-ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide [R2ICE]) for the treatment of
      primary-refractory/first-relapse B-cell lymphoma. (Phase I) II. To determine if the addition
      of lenalidomide (based on dose determination from phase I) to the R-ICE chemoimmunotherapy
      regimen (R2-ICE) would lead to clinically meaningful improvement in the overall response
      rates (ORR) for patients with first-relapse/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of the addition of lenalidomide to RICE on the number (percentage)
      of patients proceeding to stem cell transplant (SCT).

      II. To evaluate the effect of the addition of lenalidomide to RICE on other surrogate
      outcome measures including complete metabolic response (CMR) rate and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. ORR based on germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) versus non-GCB subtypes. II. Role of
      positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans. III. Minimal residual
      disease (MRD) detection and quantification. IV. Future tissue and blood based studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-14, rituximab intravenously (IV)
      on day 1, ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on day 2, carboplatin IV over 1-2 hours on day 2, and
      etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving CMR, partial
      metabolic response (PMR), or no metabolic response (NMR) may receive 2 more courses per
      physician discretion. After completion of 2 cycles of R2ICE treatment, patients achieving
      objective status of CMR, PMR or NMR may proceed to SCT during the event monitoring phase.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and
      then yearly for 2 years.

             patients would not need the aspirin with the lenalidomide unless clinically
             indicated; therefore, patients must be able and willing to receive anticoagulation
             (prophylaxis versus therapeutic as clinically indicated)

          -  No history of radiation therapy to &gt;= 25% of the bone marrow for other diseases

          -  Receiving erythroid stimulating agents (epoetin alfa [EPO]: Procrit, Aranesp)

          -  Patients with active or prior central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or cerebrospinal
             fluid involvement with malignant lymphoma cells; NOTE: these patients are usually
             treated with CNS directed therapy; screening for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/CNS
             involvement is NOT required but can be performed per treating medical doctor (MD)
             discretion

          -  Active hepatitis B as defined by seropositivity for hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg); subjects with positive hepatitis B core antibody titers and normal liver
             transaminases are allowed provided that antiviral prophylaxis is administered per
             institutional guidelines; NOTE: subjects with hepatitis C antibody will be eligible
             provided that they do not have elevated liver transaminases or other evidence of
             active hepatitis
