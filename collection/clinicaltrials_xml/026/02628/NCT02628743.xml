  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of olesoxime in participants with spinal
      muscular atrophy, focusing on the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events, as well
      as effects on laboratory values, vital signs and ECG parameters.
