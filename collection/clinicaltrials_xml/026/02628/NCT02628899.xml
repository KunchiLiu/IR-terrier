      Trial Objectives: To assess the safety and feasibility of Transcatheter Aortic Valve
      Replacement (TAVR) with commercially available bioprostheses in elderly patients with
      severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who are low‐risk (STS score ≤3%) for surgical
      aortic valve replacement (SAVR).

      Methodology: This is a multicenter, prospective trial of TAVR in low-risk patients at up to
      twelve sites in the United States. The trial will have three arms. The first will comprise
      200 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR. The second arm will comprise200 closely matched
      historical controls who underwent isolated bioprosthetic SAVR.

      Historical controls will be selected from among patients at the same site who have undergone
      isolated bioprosthetic SAVR within the previous 36 months. TAVR patients will then be
      matched to SAVR patients using STS database variables to perform propensity matching,
      including (but not limited to) age, gender, race, ethnicity, STS score, and valve prosthesis
      size. Once the historical matched controls are identified, detailed chart review will
      abstract in-hospital and 30-day outcomes for the SAVR cohort.

      The third arm of the trial will comprise a registry of TAVR in up to 100 low-risk patients
      with bicuspid aortic valve. The results from the registry arm will be analyzed
      independently.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint: All-cause mortality at 30 days following transfemoral TAVR vs.
      bioprosthetic SAVR.

      Primary Safety Endpoint: Defined as the composite of major adverse events at 30 days:

      creatinine to ≥300% (&gt;3x increase compared to baseline) OR serum creatinine ≥4.0 mg/dL with

          4. The Heart Team agrees that the patient is low-risk, quantified by an estimated risk
             of ≤3% by the calculated STS score for operative mortality at 30 days; AND agrees
             that SAVR would be an appropriate therapy if offered.

          5. The Heart Team agrees that transfemoral TAVR is anatomically feasible, based upon
             multislice CT measurements

          6. Procedure status is elective
