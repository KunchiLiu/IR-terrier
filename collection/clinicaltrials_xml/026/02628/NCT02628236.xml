  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for systemic exposure of
      aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) when applied topically under
      occlusion, in a maximal use setting in patients with multiple actinic keratoses (AK)
      involving the upper extremities.
