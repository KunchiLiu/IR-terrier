    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part A and Part B). Subjects â‰¥18 years with
      advanced solid tumors will be enrolled in the study. Dose escalation will be performed in
      Part A. Cycle 1 data from each cohort will be evaluated for safety and dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) prior to dose escalation. Subjects will be assigned to a cohort in the
      order screening is completed. Dose will depend upon the cohort in which a patient is
      enrolled and cohorts will be dosed consecutively by ascending dose. Once the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been identified, an expanded
      cohort will be enrolled (Part B).
