    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, open label, parallel , multicenter clinical study, controlled by
      active comparator ( 0.05 % Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride ) .

      The investigators hypothesis is that pediatric Naridrin® nasal solution is superior to 0.05
      % Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride in improving nasal congestion.

      Participants aged 10-17 years with a clinical diagnosis of nasal congestion of allergic or
      inflammatory origin in at least one of the nostrils due to rhinitis or rhinopharyngitis will
      be included in the trial.
