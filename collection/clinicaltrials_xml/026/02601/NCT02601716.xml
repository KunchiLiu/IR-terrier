  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label evaluation of the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of
      PfSPZ Vaccine administered by direct venous inoculation (DVI) in healthy, malaria-naïve
      adult subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a collaborative effort between the NMRC, UMB CVD, WRAIR and
      Sanaria, Inc. The study screening, immunizations and follow-ups for Groups 1 &amp; 2 will take
      place at the UMB CVD. The study screening, immunizations and follow-ups for Groups 3 &amp; 4
      will take place at the NMRC CTC in Bethesda, MD. The controlled human malaria infections
      (CHMI) will be conducted at WRAIR Entomology, Silver Spring, MD for NMRC subjects, and at
      UMB CVD for UMB CVD subjects.

      There will be 4 groups and a total of 84 subjects (60 immunized subjects and 24 infectivity
      controls). Group 1 (n=15) subjects will receive PfSPZ Vaccine administered by DVI with 4
      doses of 4.5x10^5 PfSPZ given every two days, followed by a single, boosting dose of
      4.5x10^5 PfSPZ given 16 weeks later for a total PfSPZ dose of 22.5 x 10^5. Group 2 (n=15)
      subjects will receive PfSPZ Vaccine administered by DVI with 9.0 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose,
      administered every 8 weeks for a total of 3 doses, with a total PfSPZ dose of 27 x 10^5.
      Group 3 subjects will receive PfSPZ Vaccine administered by direct venous inoculation (DVI)
      with 18 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose, administered every 8 weeks for a total of three doses, with a
      total PfSPZ dose of 54 x 10^5. Group 4 subjects will receive 27 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose,
      administered once as a priming dose, followed by 9.0 x 10^5 PfSPZ per dose, administered
      every 8 weeks for a total of two doses, with a total PfSPZ dose of 45 x 10^5.

      Protective efficacy will be assessed by CHMI, conducted by exposure to the bites of five
      mosquitoes infected with heterologous (7G8) Pf parasites. At NMRC, protective efficacy will
      be assessed at 24 weeks after the final immunization in Groups 3 and 4. At UMB CVD,
      protective efficacy will be assessed at both 12 and 24 weeks after the final immunization,
      in Groups 1 and 2. These subjects may participate in the second CHMI whether or not they
      were protected in the first CHMI, to serve as controls for the effect of the first CHMI on
      immunity. Subjects may proceed to CHMI provided they have received at least two of the three
      immunizations scheduled for Groups 2-4, or at least two of the four priming immunizations as
      well as the boost scheduled for Group 1.

      Two subjects in Groups 3 and 4 will be immunized the day before the rest of the subjects in
      the respective group (referred to as &quot;pilot subjects&quot;) for the first immunization. The
      procedure and sequence of events for immunization of the pilot subjects, and the rest of the
      subjects in the respective group will be specific to the study site. If there are no safety
      concerns identified in the pilot subjects that trigger the stopping rules, then the
      remainder of subjects will be immunized the day after the pilot subjects are immunized.

      Subjects will be followed for 56 days beyond the 24-week CHMI that takes place 24 weeks
      after the final immunization (post-immunization week 40).

             atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone®), or artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem®) such as
