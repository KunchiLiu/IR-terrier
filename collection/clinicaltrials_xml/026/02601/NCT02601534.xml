      The goal of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a family-focused and interactive
      intervention for reducing the sedentary behavior and increasing physical activity of the
      participants. The intervention is to use the concept of zero time, zero money, and zero
      equipment (3 Zero exercise), which aims to get sedentary people to start exercising. The
      intervention aims to encourage positive and sustainable health actions among participants
      and their family members.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lack of physical activity is a behavioural risk for non-communicable diseases. The World
      Health Organization (WHO) reported that physical inactivity and unhealthy diets are two of
      the four main behavioural risk factors that contribute to non-communicable diseases.
      Globally, people who are overweight and obese, particularly if these people are physically
      inactive. They are at risk for morbidity and mortality.

      Hong Kong-specific data demonstrates that many people cannot meet World Health Organization
      targets for physical activity. The 2014 Hong Kong Behavioural Risk Factor Survey reported
      that, for the seven days prior to the survey, about half (52.0%) of adults aged 18-64 had
      not done any moderate physical activity. Overall, only 37.5% of the respondents met the
      WHO's recommended physical activity level of at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes
      of vigorous physical activity a week for adults.

      There is emerging evidence of effective behavioral interventions to decrease sedentary
      behavior. Some studies focused on reducing screen time or active workstations that encourage
      standing at the computer . Others focus on increased use of stairs instead of lifts . These
      interventions used behaviour change techniques such as goal-setting and behavioural
      self-monitoring. As previous approaches have not shown promising results, new approaches are
      needed to reduce sedentary behaviour and increase exercise or physical activity.

      The goal of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a family-focused and interactive
      intervention for reducing the sedentary behaviour and increasing physical activity of the
      participants. The intervention is to use the concept of zero time, zero money, and zero
      equipment (3 Zero exercise), which aims to get sedentary people to start exercising. The
      intervention aims to encourage positive and sustainable health actions among participants
      and their family members.

      Need assessment and focus group interview will be conducted before program design and after
      conducting the training, respectively. Process evaluation will be performed to evaluate the
      process of each component of the program. Qualitative and quantitative assessments will be
      used to evaluate the effectiveness of this 3-Zero exercise intervention
