    <textblock>
      This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LXS196 as a single agent in
      patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

             to be progressive

          -  Willingness to provide newly obtained tumor tissue at baseline and on treatment
             unless contraindicated by medical risk

          -  Measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in
             at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional
             techniques or as &gt;10 mm with CT scan.
