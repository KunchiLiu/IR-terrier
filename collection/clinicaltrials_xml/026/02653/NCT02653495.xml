      Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic conditions associated with obesity that
      predispose individuals to coronary heart diseases and diabetes but obesity has been shown to
      increase the risks of other diseases like cancer and asthma. Studies have also shown that
      obesity increases the risk of severe influenza infection and associated death and reduces
      the efficacy of influenza vaccine in the obese population but yet, the molecular mechanisms
      have not been described. The investigators are thus hypothesizing that differences in the
      innate immune responses between individual with or without metabolic syndrome impact viral
      infection and vaccine outcome. The investigators will perform seasonal influenza vaccination
      in people with or without metabolic syndrome to determine if the late adaptive response
      assessed by antibodies titers is different between the two groups and correlates with the
      early immune response assessed by gene expression profile in whole blood cells. The project
      proposed by the investigators will contribute to a better understanding of the inflammatory
      phenotype associated with metabolic syndrome and establish for the first time if it affects
      the immune protection against infectious diseases and particularly against influenza virus
      infection. The results will be important to determine if the population affected by
      metabolic syndrome should receive anti-influenza treatment in priority in the context of a
      severe influenza epidemic.

      The development of industrialization with increased food consumption and sedentarity has
      given rise to an obesity pandemic, which affects up to 30% of the population in countries
      like US, these populations being at greater risk for cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes.
      More than obesity per se, visceral obesity is associated with metabolic diseases that
      cluster together and clinically defined metabolic syndrome. MetS comprises individuals with
      at least three of the 5 of the following factors: abdominal obesity, high blood
      triglycerides, low HDL (&quot;good cholesterol&quot;), high blood pressure and elevated fasting
      glucose. Metabolic syndrome is associated with a low-grade inflammation characterized by an
      infiltration of immune cells particularly in the adipose tissue, the liver and the pancreas
      that is thought to be responsible for the induction of insulin resistance. It is thought
      that obesity predisposes to other diseases such as cancer, asthma but only little attention
      has been given to infectious diseases. Studies have shown that obesity increases the risk of
      severe influenza infection and associated death and reduces the efficacy of influenza
      vaccine in the obese population but yet, the molecular mechanisms have not been described.
      Immune dysfunctions associated with obesity are suspected to play a major role but obesity
      is often associated with respiratory disorders that could directly explain the increased
      susceptibility to influenza infection. Also, metabolically healthy obesity is less
      associated with inflammation. Therefore, the investigators would like to focus particularly
      on metabolic syndrome, and determine how it influences immune response to viruses.

      The investigators are thus hypothesizing that differences in the innate immune responses
      between individual with or without metabolic syndrome impact viral infection and vaccine
      outcome. Recent studies involving complex biological analysis and computational modeling
      have shown that the ability of an individual to positively respond to influenza vaccine can
      be molecularly predicted by looking at markers in the blood cells. The investigators will
      perform seasonal influenza vaccination in people with or without metabolic syndrome to
      determine if the late adaptive response assessed by antibodies titers is different between
      the two groups and correlates with the early immune response assessed by gene expression
      profile in whole blood cells.

      Healthy nutritional habits along with increased physical activities should be best at
      preventing the development of metabolic syndrome but socio-economical issues are slowing the
      implementation of these changes. Therefore, as metabolic syndrome is raising public health
      concerns, it is important to understand why the metabolic syndrome affects susceptibility to
      diseases.
