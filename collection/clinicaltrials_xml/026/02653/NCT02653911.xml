  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a dysfunction of endocrine system of women of
      reproductive age. Approximately 5%-10% women in China have this syndrome. Irregular
      menstruation (oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea), hirsutism and obesity are the common clinical
      manifestations of PCOS. The aim of this study is to determine whether electroacupuncture
      normalizes hormonal and glycometabolic profiles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome when
      compared with placebo-needle.

    <description>Bilateral BL33 or bilateral ST25, bilateral EX-CA1 and CV4 will be alternately needled every other day. The needles will be inserted at the third sacral foramen at an angle of 45° inward and downward to a depth of 70 mm. The needles will be inserted to a depth of 30-70 mm at bilateral ST25. Bilateral EX-CA1 and CV4 will be inserted by the needles to a depth of 25-30mm. The electric stimulators will be connected to bilateral BL33, ST25 and EX-CA1 with a continuous wave with frequency of 10 Hz and electric current of 0.5-2mA according to the tolerance of the patients.</description>

    <description>The selection of acupoints, treatment sessions and treatment periods in control group are the same as which are used in treatment group. The placebo needle consists of a needle handle, a needle body, a blunt tip and an adhesive pad. The adhesive pad will be pasted on acupoints. The needle will be inserted through the adhesive pad until to the surface of the skin then with the manipulation of lifting, thrusting and twirling for 3 times without piercing the skin. Electric electrode with normal appearance but the power cords cut will be connected to bilateral BL33, ST25 and EX-CA1 . The electric parameter of electric stimulator will be the same as which is used in treatment group.</description>
