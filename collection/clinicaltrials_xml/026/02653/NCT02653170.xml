      The Michigan Stroke Transitions Trial (MISTT) is a patient-centered randomized control trial
      that aims to improve the experience of stroke patients after they return home. The MISTT
      study will test the effect of two complementary interventions against usual care. The two
      interventions include: a) Stroke Care Managers (SCMs) who are trained social workers, and b)
      an online informational website or portal. The 12 week intervention period begins when the
      stroke patient returns home from the hospital or rehab facility. The SCMs will conduct at
      least 2 home visits with the patient (one within 3-4 days and one around 30 days) along with
      weekly follow-up telephone calls. Supplemental home visits will be used as necessary over
      the 12 week period. At the first home visit the social workers will conduct a comprehensive
      in-home assessment and link patients and caregivers to local resources as necessary.
      Patients also assigned to the website will have access to a patient-centered online
      information and support resource called the Virtual Stroke Support Portal (VSSP). The
      investigators hypothesize that this personalized case management program will reduce patient
      and caregiver needs, improve quality of life, and decrease caregiver stress. The MISTT study
      will enroll 480 acute stroke patients discharged from 4 Michigan hospitals and will be
      completed by the end of 2017.

    <textblock>
      To improve care transitions for acute stroke patients this pragmatic, community-based,
      randomized, open clinical trial will test the efficacy of two separate but complementary
      interventions against usual care. The parallel group design will compare the following 3
      groups:

        1. Usual care

        2. Stroke Case Manager (SCM): trained social workers who provide home based case
           management services

        3. SCM services plus access to the Virtual Stroke Support Portal (VSSP) an online
           information and support resource.

      This patient-level randomized trial will be conducted at 4 Michigan hospitals and will
      enroll a total of 480 acute stroke patients (160 per intervention group). Each hospital will
      enroll 120 cases over a 15 month period. Randomization will be balanced within each hospital
      to ensure that an equal number of patients are assigned to the 3 groups. If the patient
      identifies a primary caregivers they will be contacted and enrollment accordingly.

      The trial interventions begin once the patient returns home (= Day 1) and end 3 months later
      (= Day 90). Outcomes data will be collected by telephone at baseline and at 90-days by
      interviewers blinded to group allocation. Subjects who are enrolled but do not go home
      within 1 month (because they remain in a rehabilitation or Skilled Nursing Facility) will be
      dropped and replaced by new patients. Two primary patient-level outcome measures include the
      Patient Activation Measure (PAM), a measure of self-efficacy, and the PROMIS-10, a global
      quality of life scale. Two primary caregiver-level outcome measures include the Bakas
      Caregiving Outcomes Scale (BCOS) and depression (PHQ-9).

      By adhering to the principles of pragmatic trials, this trial is designed to inform typical
      U.S. clinical practice, with outcomes that are directly relevant to patients and caregivers.
      Specifically, this trial is designed to answer the practical question of whether the
      transitional care experience of stroke patients and caregivers can be improved by social
      workers who visit the home, and whether their effectiveness can be enhanced by a
      comprehensive patient-centered online resource.
