      This is a phase 1, non-randomized, fixed sequence, 3-period, drug-drug interaction study to
      assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD7986 in healthy subjects when administered alone and
      in combination with multiple doses of verapamil and itraconazole or diltiazem

    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, non-randomised, fixed sequence, 3-period study conducted
      at a single study centre to assess the PK of AZD7986 in healthy subjects when administered
      alone and in combination with multiple doses of verapamil and itraconazole or diltiazem. An
      adaptive design with an interim analysis of the PK data from Periods 1 and 2 will be used to
      determine which of itraconazole or diltiazem will be administered in combination with
      AZD7986 in Period 3.

      Treatments to be administered in a fixed order separated by a washout period:

      period 1 - single AZD7986 (25 mg) on Day 1 (1 hour before food), washout 7 days period 2 -
      verapamil (240 mg extended release formulation) daily 1 hour before food (Day 1 to 10) and a
      single dose of AZD7986 (25 mg) 1 hour before food (Day 5), washout period 14 days period 3 -
      subject to interim pharmacokinetic analysis of AZD7986 alone compared with AZD7986 and
      verapamil combined, either itraconazole (200 mg, oral solution formulation 10mg/mL)
      administered twice on Day 1 and daily on days 2 to 11 (1 hour before food) plus AZD7986
      (25mg) single dose on Day 6 (1 hour before food); or diltiazem (360 mg, extended release
      formulation) on Days 1 to 13 (1 hour before food) plus AZD7986 (25 mg) 1 hour before food on
      Day 8.

                  resided in regions where tuberculosis and mycosis are endemic during 90 days
                  before screening, or who intend to visit such a region during the duration of
                  the study i.e., deserts areas, Eastern Europe, Central and South America, Africa

                  herpes, urinary tract infection) or at risk of infection (surgery, trauma, or
                  significant infection) within 90 days of screening, or history of skin abscesses
                  within 90 days of screening.

               -  Clinically significant lower respiratory tract infection not resolved within 4

                  to dosing.

               -  High-sensitivity C-reactive protein above upper limit of laboratory reference
                  range at screening and on Day -1.

         29. Subjects with a history or signs of current gingivitis/periodontitis or a history or
             current hyperkeratosis of palms and soles will be excluded. (Due to the fact that
             many subjects lacking functional DPP1 enzyme have been described to have
             periodontitis and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.)

         30. Subjects with total urinary protein/urine creatinine ratio outside the normal range.

             failure (including left ventricular heart failure).

         37. History of atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

         38. Known hypersensitivity to diltiazem or to any of the excipients.

         39. Known hypersensitivity to itraconazole or to any of the excipients.

         40. Elevated or abnormal liver enzymes or active liver disease, or who have experienced
             liver toxicity with other drugs.
