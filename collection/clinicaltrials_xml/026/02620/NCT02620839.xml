  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib dose escalation / expansion study with the combination of alpelisib and
      weekly cisplatin. Dose escalation will follow standard 3+3 design. During dose escalation,
      two dose levels of weekly cisplatin (30 and 35 mg/m2, respectively) will be evaluated in
      combination with escalating doses of alpelisib in parallel. Cohort B (cisplatin 35 mg/m2) at
      a given dose level of alpelisib to open only after corresponding A cohort (cisplatin 30
      mg/m2) at the same dose level of alpelisib has cleared DLT window. Cohorts A and B may
      enroll in parallel (e.g., Cohort 3A may enroll in parallel with Cohort 2B) as shown below in
      the dose escalation schema. Intermediate dose levels and alternative dosing schedules may be
      investigated per the discretion of Principal Investigator using same 3+3 dose escalation
      schema (e.g. cisplatin administered days 1, 8 of 21 day cycle).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The starting dose of alpelisib at 200 mg once daily was chosen based upon the aggregate of
      safety, PK, and efficacy data shown above, indicating:

        1. Single agent activity of alpelisib at daily doses of 200 mg and above

        2. Largely non-overlapping toxicity profile between alpelisib and cisplatin

        3. MTD of alpelisib in combination with cetuximab in prior study was 300 mg once daily.

      The investigators will escalate at 50 mg increments per dose level, up to a maximum dose of
      350 mg daily. Though the single agent MTD/RP2D of alpelisib is 400 mg, in combination with a
      variety of targeted therapies the MTD/RP2D is in the range of 300-350 mg daily.

      The investigators chose a weekly cisplatin dosing schedule which has demonstrated activity
      in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and cervix. Both 30 and 35 mg/m2 of
      cisplatin weekly have been shown to have activity in HNSCC and other squamous cell
      histologies, and the investigators will investigate both dose levels in combination with
      alpelisib as shown in section 3 of the protocol.

          -  Patients who are currently receiving medication with a known risk of prolonging the
             QT interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes (TdP) and the treatment cannot either be

             treatment. A list of prohibited drugs with a known risk of TdP is provided in
             Appendix.

          -  Patient is currently receiving treatment with drugs known to be strong inhibitors or
             inducers of isoenzyme CYP3A. The patient must have discontinued strong inducers for
             at least one week and must have discontinued strong inhibitors before the start of
             treatment. Switching to a different medication is allowed. (Refer to Appendix)

             required)

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL)

          -  Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the study and
             through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment:

        Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 16
        weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a child in this
        period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm. A condom is
        required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via
        seminal fluid.

        Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming
        pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and through at least 16
        weeks after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective contraception is defined
        as either:

        Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
        subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation
        methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].

        Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
        hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case
        of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed
        by follow up hormone level assessment.

        Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the
        absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study subjects, the vasectomized male
        partner should be the sole partner for that patient].

        Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

        Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) Barrier methods of
        contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
        foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.

        Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not allowed
        as alpelisib may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have had
        12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.
        age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
        oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago.

        For women with therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of FSH
        and/or estradiol are needed to ensure postmenopausal status.

        NOTE: Ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH)
        agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is not permitted for induction of
        ovarian suppression.
