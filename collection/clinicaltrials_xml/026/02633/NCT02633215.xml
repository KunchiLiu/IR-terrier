      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of sustained peripheral nerve stimulation coupled
      with functional motor training, to improve hand motor function in poorly recovered stroke
      patients. The central hypothesis is that stroke patients with severe motor deficit receiving
      hand nerve stimulation and intensive task-oriented therapy will have improved motor function
      compared to patients receiving sham nerve stimulation and task-oriented therapy.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the most devastating and prevalent diseases, but efforts to limit the
      amount of tissue damaged in the acute phase have been disappointing, highlighting the need
      for effective therapeutic interventions after neurologic damage has occurred. Data from
      animal and human models have suggested that sensory input plays an important role in motor
      output, possibly by influencing cortical plasticity. However, in spite of the advances to
      date, little is known about the extent to which sensory input in the form of peripheral
      nerve stimulation can be successfully combined to physical training especially in poorly
      recovered stroke patients. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of sustained
      peripheral nerve stimulation coupled with functional motor training, to improve hand motor
      function in stroke patients with severe motor deficit. The central hypothesis is that stroke
      patients with severe motor deficit receiving hand nerve stimulation and intensive
      task-oriented therapy will have improved motor function compared to patients receiving sham
      nerve stimulation and task-oriented therapy, and the degree of this behaviorally-measured
      effect will correlate with the neurophysiological effect measured by transcranial magnetic
      stimulation.
