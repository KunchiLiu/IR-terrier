  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel groups study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and the efficacy of
      riociguat compared with placebo in patients with SCD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a screening epoch, a 12 week double blinded treatment epoch, and a
      follow-up epoch of 30 days post treatment. Following completion of screening and baseline
      assessment, patients who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be
      randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either placebo or riociguat at the starting dose of 1.0
      mg TID (three times a day) for 12 weeks. The dose will be titrated every 2 weeks based on
      patient's monitoring of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and well-being assessed at that visit.
      Safety monitoring including physical examinations, hemodynamics, vital signs, clinical
      laboratory assessment will be conducted at 2 week intervals during the double blinded study
      treatment. Safety and tolerability, especially pain, will be assessed using several specific
      patient reported outcome instruments. Functional outcomes measuring the changes in six
      minute walk distances and Borg Dyspnea Scores will be assessed from baseline to Week 12.

             hemoglobin electrophoresis or HPLC fractionation)

             condoms with hormonal contraception or implants or combined oral contraceptives,
             certain intrauterine devices). Adequate contraception is required beginning at the
             signing of the informed consent form until one month after the last dose of
             riociguat.

          -  Patients must be willing to provide a blood sample for DNA analysis.

          -  Patients on phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE-5) (such as sildenafil,
             tadalafil, vardenafil) and nonspecific PDE inhibitors (such as dipyridamole or
             theophylline) or nitrates

          -  Patients on strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) and P-glycoprotein 1(P-gp)/BCRP inhibitors
             such as systemic azole antimycotics (eg: ketoconazole, itraconazole), or HIV protease
             inhibitors (such as ritonavir)

          -  Patients on St. John's wort

          -  If patients are taking antihypertensive drugs or hydroxyurea prior to enrollment,
             they are excluded until the dose level is stable for at least three months

          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt;95 mm Hg at Screening Visit 1 or 2 or Week 0 before
             randomization
