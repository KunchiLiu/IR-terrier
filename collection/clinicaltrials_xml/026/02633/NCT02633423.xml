      During general anesthesia a reduction of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) was observed.
      The reduction of FRC could imply that respiratory system closing capacity (CC) exceeds the
      FRC and leads to a phenomenon called expiratory flow limitation (EFL). Positive
      End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) test is a validated method to evaluate the presence of EFL
      during anesthesia. Aim of the study will be to asses if mechanical ventilation during
      CardioPulmonary Bypass (CPB) in cardiac surgery could reduce the incidence of EFL in the
      post-CPB period. Primary end-point will be the incidence of EFL, assessed by a PEEP test,
      performed at different time-points in operating room. Co-primary end-point will be shunt
      fraction, determined before and after surgery.

      This will be a single center single-blind parallel group randomized controlled trial.
      Patients will be randomly assigned to three parallel arms with an allocation ratio 1:1:1, to
      receive one of three mechanical ventilation strategies during CPB.

        1. Ventilation stop during CPB;

        2. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) during CPB, with an airway pressure of 5
           cmH2O;

        3. Low tidal low frequency ventilation, with 5 acts per minute, with a tidal volume of 2-3
           ml/kg of IBW and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

      Introduction During general anesthesia a reduction of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) was
      observed. The reduction of FRC could imply that respiratory system closing capacity (CC)
      exceeds the FRC and leads to a phenomenon called expiratory flow limitation (EFL). Several
      factors contribute to the EFL phenomenon during general anesthesia, including anesthesia
      induction by itself. High oxygen concentrations, muscle paralysis, supine positioning,
      increased extravascular water because of perioperative fluid therapy and inflammatory
      response also play a role in this picture.

      Moreover cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with aortic cross-clamping, which is necessary for the
      majority of procedures in cardiac surgery, was associated with direct lung damage. Pulmonary
      atelectasis, apnea and ischemia during CPB and activation of proteolytic enzymes in the
      pulmonary circulation influence the incidence of postoperative pulmonary dysfunction after
      cardiac surgery.

      Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) test is a validated method to evaluate the presence
      of EFL during anesthesia. PEEP-test is a feasible and completely safe measure of the
      reduction of FRC in mechanically ventilated patients.

      Aim of the study will be to asses if mechanical ventilation during CPB in cardiac surgery
      could reduce the incidence of EFL in the post-CPB period.

      Primary end-point Primary end-point will be the incidence of EFL, assessed by a PEEP test,
      performed at different time-points in operating room.

      Co-primary end-point will be shunt fraction, determined before and after surgery.

      Secondary end-points

      Secondary end-points will include:

        -  duration of mechanical ventilation;

        -  ICU length of stay;

        -  hospital length of stay.

      Materials and methods This will be a single center single-blind parallel group randomized
      controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to three parallel arms with an
      allocation ratio 1:1:1, to receive one of three mechanical ventilation strategies during
      CPB. Patients that will match the following criteria at the preoperative evaluation will be
      recruited.

      Randomization and masking Patient will be randomized according to a computer-generated list
      of casual numbers. Information about patient allocation will be kept in closed opaque
      envelopes and nobody will know patient allocation before randomization. Patients will be
      blind to allocation.

      Ventilation protocol All patients will receive lung protective ventilation, with a tidal
      volume of 7 ml/kg of ideal body weight (IBW), a respiratory frequency titrated to maintain
      normocapnia and a PEEP of 0 cmH2O, Zero End-Expiratory Pressure (ZEEP) until CPB. After CPB
      patients will be ventilated with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) will
      never be higher than 80%, with the exception of the blood samples obtained for shunt
      fraction calculation.

      At moment of CPB, patients will be subsequently randomized into three arms:

        1. Ventilation stop during CPB;

        2. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) during CPB, with an airway pressure of 5
           cmH2O;

        3. Low tidal low frequency ventilation, with 5 acts per minute, with a tidal volume of 2-3
           ml/kg of IBW and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

      After CPB a single recruitment maneuver will be performed manually, in correspondence to the
      surgical de-airing procedure. Airway pressure will be kept at 40 cmH2O for at least 10
      seconds.

      EFL determination EFL will be determined with the following procedure. PEEP value will be
      set to 3 cmH2O for 5 respiratory acts. A flow-volume loop will be visualized on the
      ventilator screen. Then expiratory resistance will be suddenly decreased by a subtraction of
      3 cmH2O of PEEP. A patient will be judged having EFL when the subtraction of PEEP will not
      increase the expiratory flow when compared to the previous test breath. Otherwise a patient
      will not be considered having EFL, if the subtraction of 3 cmH2O of PEEP will increase
      expiratory flow. All loops will be saved in electronic format for further analysis.

      EFL will be determined at the following time-points:

        -  after anesthesia induction;

        -  after sternotomy;

        -  during CPB, immediately before the recruitment maneuver;

        -  after the recruitment maneuver;

        -  before sternosynthesis;

        -  before discharge from operating room. After ICU arrival a best PEEP will be determined
           in patients having EFL and set for all the postoperative ICU stay. The best PEEP will
           be defined as the PEEP value able to completely eliminate EFL, assessed with the same
           method of the PEEP-test. Patients without EFL at arrival in ICU will be ventilated with
           a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

      Lung mechanics determination

      Quasi-static compliance of respiratory system (Cqst,rs) will be calculated as:

      Tidal volume / (end inspiratory plateau pressure - PEEPtot (ml/cmH2O) where PEEPtot is the
      end-expiratory pressure at period of no-flow. Measurement will be performed with an
      inspiratory pause of 60%.

      Airway resistance (Rmin,rs) will be calculated as:

      (Ppeak - P1) / V' where Ppeak is the peak inspiratory pressure, P1 is the airways pressure
      at the point of zero flow and V' is the inspiratory flow. Measurement will be performed with
      an inspiratory pause of 60%.

      Lung mechanics will be determinated immediately after every PEEP test execution.

      Dead space calculation

      Dead space fraction calculation will be performed with the Enghoff modification of the Bohr
      equation:

      Vd/Vt = (PaCO2-PECO2)/PaCO2

      Where:

        -  Vd is the dead space

        -  Vt tidal volume

        -  PECO2 is pressure of mean expired CO2

      Shunt fraction calculation

      Shunt fraction will be determined before surgery and after surgery in operating room during
      general anesthesia, before patient discharge from operating room. Shunt fraction will be
      assessed as follows in all patients:

      Qs/Qt = (PAO2 - PaO2)*0,0031 / C(a-v mixed)O2 + [(PAO2 - PaO2)*0,0031]

      Where:

        -  PAO2 is oxygen alveolar concentration;

        -  PaO2 is oxygen arterial concentration;

        -  C(a-v mixed)O2 is arterovenous difference in oxygen concentration;

        -  0,0031 is a conversion factor to volume percent for O2.

      Measure will be performed while breathing 100% oxygen for 20 minutes, to achieve a complete
      hemoglobin saturation.

      If a Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC) will be placed, according to clinical indications,
      shunt fraction will be calculated from the following formula:

      Qs/Qt = CcO2-CaO2 / CcO2-Cv(mixed)O2 * 100

      Where:

      â€¢ CcO2 is pulmonary capillary blood O2 content, estimated with the following equation: CcO2
      = (Hb * 1.34) + (0.0031 * PAO2);

        -  CaO2 is arterial oxygen content;

        -  Cv(mixed)O2 is oxygen content in blood samples obtained from the pulmonary artery;

        -  PAO2 is alveolar oxygen partial pressure. Blood samples will be collected from arterial
           catheter and pulmonary artery catheter, under a FiO2 of 100% in the same moment.

      Furthermore Blood Gas Analyses (BGA) will be performed on arterial blood:

        -  after anesthesia induction;

        -  after sternotomy, together with heparinization;

        -  before sternosynthesis, together with protamine administration;

        -  before discharge from operating room.

      Sample size calculation Sample-size calculation was based on a two-sided alpha error of 0.05
      and a 80% power (beta). On the basis of their experience and the few studies available, the
      investigators anticipate that the 50% of patients with ventilation stop during CPB will
      experience a EFL after CPB, while about the 25% of patients treated with CPAP and low tidal
      ventilation will have EFL, with a reduction of 50%. The investigators calculate that they
      will need a sample size of 43 patients per group, 129 in total. Including a drop-out
      fraction of 10%, the investigators calculate that they will be needing 144 patients to
      complete the trial.

      Data collection and analysis Data will be collected on the appropriate Case Report Form
      (CRF). In particular anamnestic information will be collected, data about surgery and
      post-operative clinical data, in particular respiratory parameters. Data will be analyzed
      with a professional statistical software. Dichotomous variables will be compared with the
      two-tailed Chi square test, using the Yates correction when appropriate. Continuous
      variables will be compared by analysis of variance or the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis
      test, when appropriate.

      Informed consent and trial conduction Each patients will provide informed consent. All parts
      of this trial will be conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) statement as
      well as Italian and international law on clinical research.
