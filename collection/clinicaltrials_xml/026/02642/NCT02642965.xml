      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of liposomal
      cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 (CPX-351) when given with fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine,
      and filgrastim and to see how well they work in treating younger patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia that has come back after treatment (relapsed) or is not responding to treatment (is
      refractory). Liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 is made up of two chemotherapy drugs,
      cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride, and works to stop cancer cell growth by blocking
      the cells from dividing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate and
      cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Filgrastim may
      increase the production of blood cells and may help the immune system recover from the side
      effects of chemotherapy. Giving liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 followed by
      fludarabine phosphate, cytarabine, and filgrastim may be a better treatment for patients
      with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and may cause fewer side effects to the heart, a common
      effect of other chemotherapy treatments for acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and the toxicities associated with CPX-351
      in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To estimate the response rate (complete remission [CR] plus complete remission with
      partial platelet recovery [CRp]) after CPX-351 (cycle 1) followed by fludarabine phosphate,
      cytarabine, and filgrastim (FLAG) (cycle 2) in children with AML in first relapse.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rate (CR + CRp + complete remission with incomplete blood count
      recovery [CRi]) after one cycle of CPX-351.

      II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of plasma cytarabine and daunorubicin after CPX-351
      administration to pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the response in biomarkers of cardiac injury to a single cycle of CPX-351.

      II. To explore the effect of CPX-351 on novel biochemical and imaging markers of
      cardiotoxicity, including plasma micro ribonucleic acid (RNAs) (miRNA) and myocardial
      deformation.

      III. To explore the role of rare coding variants as risk factors for anthracycline-induced
      cardiomyopathy.

      OUTLINE:

      COURSE 1: Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 0 and at day 28-30 or up to
      1 week prior to day 1 of course 2, and liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients without evidence of central
      nervous system (CNS) disease (CNS1) receive no further CNS-directed therapy in course 1.
      Patients with &lt; 5 white blood cells per microliter of blood with blast cells (CNS2) disease
      may receive an additional dose of cytarabine IT on day 7 at the discretion of the
      investigator. Patients meeting criteria for CR, CRp, and CRi may proceed to course 2.

      COURSE 2: Beginning 28 days later, patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days
      1-5 and then on day 15 until blood count recovery, and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30
      minutes and high-dose cytarabine IV over 1-3 hours on days 1-5.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months,
      and then yearly for 5 years.
