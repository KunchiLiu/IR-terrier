      The focus of the study will be newly diagnosed lymphoma and acute leukemia patients and

      with inpatient teaching and anxiety about inpatient treatment.

      The experimental group will watch a DVD educational presentation of information about unit
      routines and activities; leukemia/lymphoma; treatment modalities and procedures; treatment
      of side effects; and patient and family members activities of importance to prevent
      infection and promote well-being during cancer treatment.

      Participants in the control group will receive usual educational teaching by their assigned
      nursing staff.

    <measure>Quality of Discharge Teaching Scale (QDTS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Educational Teaching (Up to 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall satisfaction will be measured with the Quality of Discharge Teaching Scale (QDTS).The QDTS is a 24 item survey to evaluate all of the teaching received by patients during their hospitalization prior to discharge. Each item on the survey is rated on a 0 to 10 numeric scale, with 0 representing an item was not addressed and 10 representing an item addressed a great deal. For each aspect of education or information being evaluated, participant are asked to rate the content of the education, as well as the delivery of the content.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Educational Teaching (Up to 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are instructed to place a horizontal mark across the 100 mm vertical line anchored at one end with the words &quot;No Anxiety&quot; and at the other end &quot;Worst Anxiety Imaginable&quot; at the level of their anxiety about inpatient cancer treatment. Rating of anxiety for the study will be done by having the participant mark their anxiety level on a new, unmarked VAS. Scoring of the VAS is done by measuring in millimeters from the end of the vertical line with the anchor phrases of &quot;no anxiety&quot; to the intersection of the participant's mark on the vertical line. Possible scores on the VAS range from 0 to 100 millimeters with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety.</description>
