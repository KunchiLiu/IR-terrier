      The aim of the study to evaluate Five-Dimensional Ultrasound in automated measurement of
      ovarian follicles with controlled ovarian stimulation in contrast to the conventional 2D
      ultrasound

      This is a Prospective pilot study that will be performed at the Fetal Care Unit at Ain Shams
      University Maternity Hospital.

      72 women will be recruited from the the Fetal Care Unit who will fulfill the inclusion
      criteria. They will be counseled to be included into the study.

      All cases will be subjected to:

      full history taking including patient's age, parity,last menstrual period , past history of
      medical disorders, clinical examinations (General and abdominal).

      Two-Dimensional Ultrasound and Five-Dimensional Ultrasound will be done for all cases for
      assessment of ovarian follicles after controlled ovarian stimulation by clomid 50 mg5×2×1
      The automated software allows for automated three-dimensional follicular measurement.The
      software then analyzes the volume and automatically identifies all of the follicles in the
      ovary. The software also automatically generates several volumetric parameters of each and
      every identified follicle.
