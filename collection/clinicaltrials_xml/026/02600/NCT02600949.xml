    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is possible to make a vaccine for
      advanced pancreatic or colorectal cancer. The safety of this vaccine will also be studied.

      This study will use your tumor cells (either from a fresh biopsy or from leftover tissue
      samples) and blood to help create a vaccine designed specifically for you based on what the
      study doctor and research staff can learn about the type of mutated proteins (a type of
      genetic change) in the tumor.

      Tissue Collection:

      Within 4 weeks after signing this informed consent document, as part of the screening tests:

        -  You will have leftover frozen tissue collected to create your vaccine, if available. If
           there is not enough frozen tissue available, then leftover tissue from a recent
           procedure performed as part of your standard of care will be collected. The study study
           staff may ask you to take part in another MD Anderson clinical research study
           (PA15-0176) for collection of leftover tissue. The study doctor will discuss this with
           you and, if you decide to take part, you will sign a separate informed consent
           document.

      After the tissue cells have been collected, your vaccine will be made.

      The vaccine can also be made from blood cells. If you agree, you will be consented and
      enrolled under a separate protocol, PA14-0138, to have the leukapheresis procedure
      performed. Leukapheresis is a special type of blood draw procedure that separates the red
      blood cells, white blood cells, and other parts of your blood from each other. The consent
      form for this protocol will explain how the leukapheresis procedure is performed and its
      risks. The white blood cells collected from leukapheresis will be used in this study.

      Baseline Tests:

      You must receive at least 1 type of chemotherapy after you are enrolled in this study but
      before your first dose of vaccine. There is no limit to the number of types of chemotherapy
      you may receive. Your study doctor will decide when you will enter the treatment part of
      this study.

      Within 28 days after your last dose of chemotherapy:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. The routine blood draw
           will include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.

      Within 14 days before your first dose of vaccine, you will have an MRI or CT scan of the
      chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

      Study Vaccine Administration:

      About 28 days after your last dose of chemotherapy, you will receive the vaccine as an
      injection under the skin on Day 1 of Weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9.

      Imiquimod cream will be applied over the injection site about 30 minutes after you receive
      the vaccine. This will be done each time you receive the vaccine.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Weeks 0, 3, 6, 9:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test for genetic
           mutations.

        -  During Week 6 only, you will have an MRI or CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

      On Day 1 of Weeks 12 and 20, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to test for genetic
      mutations.

      On Day 1 of Week 16:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive the vaccine for up to 9 weeks. You may be able to continue receiving the
      vaccine after Week 9, if the disease is stable or appears to be getting better. The study
      doctor will discuss this with you.

      You will no longer be able to receive the study vaccine if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after follow-up.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 8 weeks after your last study visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Follow-Up:

      You will be called 2 times by the study staff in the 6 months after your last dose of
      vaccine and asked about any side effects you may have experienced since the end-of-study
      visit. Each call should last about 10 minutes.

      If you left the study because you had side effects, you will be called by the study staff
      until that side effect has gone away or has become stable.

      This is an investigational study. The study vaccine is not FDA approved or commercially
      available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can
      explain how the vaccine is designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

             written informed consent document.

          9. The effects of a peptide based vaccine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception at study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately. Birth control specifications:
             unless surgically sterile by bilateral tubal ligation or vasectomy of partner(s),
             sexually active participants must use birth control during and for 1 month after the
             study. Acceptable forms of birth control include condom, diaphragm, hormonal, IUD, or
             sponge plus spermicide. Abstinence is also an acceptable form of birth control.
