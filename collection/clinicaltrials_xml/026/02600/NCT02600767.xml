      This is an in vivo evaluation of drug efficacy performed in Cruzeiro do Sul, in the state of
      Acre, Brazil. A total of 81 participants ≥5 years old with parasitological confirmation of
      P. falciparum monoinfection will be treated under supervision with artemether-lumefantrine
      for three days, with doses according to the Brazilian guidelines for malaria control. The
      clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored for a 28-day follow-up period to
      evaluate the efficacy of the combination therapy. A blood sample will be collected on filter
      paper on the first day and on the day of suspected failure to try to differentiate the
      parasite genotypes using techniques based on polymerase chain reactions. The results of this
      efficacy evaluation on the drug combination will help the Brazilian Ministry of Health to
      evaluate the national policy for treatment of malaria caused by P. falciparum.

      This protocol uses the recommended World Health Organization (WHO) protocol for monitoring
      antimalarial efficacy. Patients with malaria will receive supervised therapy and will be
      monitored for 28 days to check for treatment response, both clinically and
      parasitologically. A total of 81 participants ≥5 years old with parasitological confirmation
      of P. falciparum monoinfection will be treated under supervision with
      artemether-lumefantrine for three days, with doses according to the Brazilian guidelines for
      malaria control. The clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored for a 28-day
      follow-up period to evaluate the efficacy of the combination therapy. Patients will be asked
      to come back on Days 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 for clinical evaluation and blood tests using
      microscopy. A blood sample will be collected on filter paper on the first day and on the day
      of suspected failure to try to differentiate the parasite genotypes using techniques based
      on polymerase chain reactions, this will allow us to determine if the recurrent infection
      was reinfection or failure or recrudescence. Results of this evaluation will guide treatment
      policies in Brazil.
