  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of induction treatment
      with obinutuzumab, polatuzumab vedotin, and lenalidomide in participants with relapsed or
      refractory FL or DLBCL. Participants with FL who achieve complete response (CR), partial
      response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at the end of induction therapy will receive
      post-induction treatment with obinutuzumab and lenalidomide, and participants with DLBCL who
      achieve CR or PR at the end of induction will also be eligible for post-induction treatment.
