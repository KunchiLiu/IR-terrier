      The aim of this study was to evaluate structural and functional improvement following
      intraocular pressure (IOP) reductions in patients with glaucoma using Spectral Domain
      Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT), Visual Field (VF) testing, and Visual Evoked
      Potential (VEP).

      Glaucoma exhibits characteristic changes to the optic nerve in the back of the eye. The
      optic nerve is formed when fibers that overlay the retina come together. This layer is
      called the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL).

      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a machine that scans the eyes and has the capability
      of measuring the thickness of the various layers of the retina and NFL. This gives doctors
      very important anatomical information. Heidelberg Engineering has introduced Spectralis OCT
      and Carl Zeiss Meditec has introduced Cirrus OCT.

      VEP (visual evoked potential) is an imaging system that measures the electrical signal from
      the eye to the brain by using electrodes placed on the forehead and back of the head. This
      is similar in principal to an electrocardiogram of the heart.

      Visual field testing is done to evaluate the extent of side vision loss a patient has with
      various diseases of the eye, including glaucoma. (This is testing which is done while you
      stare at a small light directly in front of your eye while lights are flashing one at a time
      in every direction on a screen surrounding the central light. You will be asked to push a
      button each time you see a flash &quot;out of the corner of your eye&quot;).

      Lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the eye has been shown to result in reversal of
      glaucoma changes of the optic nerve in some patients. It has also been suggested that
      improvement in function (visual field) has been associated with this improved optic nerve
      appearance.

      This study provides evidence for structural disc cupping reversal following IOP lowering
      interventions. These changes were not related to the amount of pressure lowering. While
      there was evidence of functional improvement as measured by VF testing, VEP was unable to
      detect any reversible changes.
