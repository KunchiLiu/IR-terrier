  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A first-in-human clinical trial to treat patients with multiple sclerosis by vaccination
      with tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC), generated using Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
      will be conducted. In doing so, the feasibility and safety of administering myelin-derived
      peptide-pulsed tolDC in patients with MS will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase I dose-escalating clinical trial will be conducted in a coordinated and
      comprehensive manner to determine safety and tolerability, and to enable selection of a
      suitable dose regimen for phase II trials. The primary objective of the phase I study will
      be to determine whether tolDC-based therapy is safe and well tolerated and to establish the
      dose-response, with clinical relapse rates, neurological disability (assessed using various
      scales) and MRI endpoints, measured over 12 months. Patients will serve as their own
      controls pre- and post-vaccination. Completion of screening assessments and confirmation of
      eligibility criteria should take no longer than 6 weeks. First-line treatments will be
      stopped 6 weeks before baseline at the latest.
