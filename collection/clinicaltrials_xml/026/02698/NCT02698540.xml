      The purpose is to observe the compliance to a high-calorie, high protein peptide-based
      nutritional supplement after 3 months in a malnourished population with impaired
      gastrointestinal tolerance living in nursing homes and as outpatients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is considered malnourished, or is at risk for malnutrition based on MUST
             score ≥2.

          -  Subject is ≥18 years old.

          -  Subject has a condition that would benefit from a high calorie, higher protein ONS
             for GI tolerance impairment (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, satiety or bloating).

          -  Subject conforms to the requirements set forth on the study product label.

          -  Subject is under the care of a health care professional for malnutrition and has
             recently (within the last 7 days prior to participating in this study) been
             prescribed 2 servings/day of the study ONS. Subject must have been naïve to ONS for
             GI tolerance impairment prior to being prescribed the study ONS.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The study physician determines the subject is not fit to participate

          -  Subject cannot provide informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Subject cannot safely consume the oral nutritional supplement.

          -  Renal or liver failure (GFR&lt; 60 ml/min or AST/ALTx3 normal) upper limit.

          -  Type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
