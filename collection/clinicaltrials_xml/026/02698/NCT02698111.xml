      The investigators do the clinical trial (patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma
      treated with donafenib after failure of standard therapy) to assess safety and efficacy of
      donafenib in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, progressing after all
      approved standard therapies.

      The study is an open-label, phase 1B study recruiting 18 patients. Patients were eligible to
      participate when they have histological or cytological documentation of the nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma. They must have received locally and currently approved standard therapies and to
      have disease progression after the last administration of the last standard therapy or to
      have stopped standard therapy because of unacceptable toxic effects. The available standard
      therapies have to include one or more drugs of the following as were licensed: a
      fluoropyrimidine,taxane,DDP, gemcitabine.

      Patients have to be aged 18 years or older and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; life expectancy of at least 3 months;and adequate
      bone-marrow, liver, and renal function at the start of the trial. Patients could not
      participate if they had previously received sorafenib or had uncontrolled medical disorders.
      All patients receive best supportive care, excluding other investigational antitumour agents
      or antineoplastic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy.Patients receive oral
      donafenib 200mg (CM4307) of each 4 week cycle until disease progression,death, unacceptable
      toxic effects, withdrawal of consent by the patient,or decision by the treating physician
      that discontinuation would be in the patient's best interest.The primary endpoint is
      safety.The second endpoint is progression-free survival.
