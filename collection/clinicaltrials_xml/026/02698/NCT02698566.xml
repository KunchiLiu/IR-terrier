  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study designed to evaluate usability of Lucentis prefilled syringe
      (PFS) in participants with neovascular age related macular degeneration or macular edema
      secondary to retinal vein occlusion.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of health care providers (HCPs) to follow
      the instructions for use (IFU) to prepare and administer a Lucentis PFS ITV injection dose
      to patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Ocular

          -  Study eye deemed to be indicated for ranibizumab ITV therapy at the discretion of the
             retina specialist

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Concurrent Ocular Conditions

          -  Participants legally blind in one or both eyes

          -  History of or any current clinically relevant intraocular inflammation or ocular
             inflammatory reaction (any grading from trace and greater is excluded), including
             non-infectious uveitis or uveitis, or sterile inflammatory reaction after the past
             ITV injections with any agent

          -  Active disorder of ocular adnexa and skin in the study eye, including ocular surface
             infections

          -  History of or any current indication of excessive bleeding and recurrent hemorrhages,
             including any prior excessive intraocular (including subconjunctival) bleeding or
             hemorrhages after ITV injection or intraocular procedures

          -  Uncontrolled intraocular pressure greater than (&gt;) 25 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) in
             the study eye (uncontrolled means that it occurs even with intraocular
             pressure-lowering therapy)

          -  Use of therapies that are known to be toxic to any ocular tissues within the 6 months
             prior to enrollment

        Prior Ocular Therapies

          -  Treatment with any ITV injection within the 27 days prior to Day 1

          -  Any invasive intraocular surgery, prior long-acting therapeutic agent, or ocular drug
             release device implantation (approved or investigational) in the study eye at any
             time during the past 3 months

        General

          -  Receipt of any systemic (non-ocular) investigational drug within 3 months prior to
             Day 1

          -  Current systemic coagulation or bleeding disorders and history of recurrent
             hemorrhages

          -  Intolerance or known reaction to prior biological therapies

          -  History of other diseases or physical or laboratory examination findings that per the
             retina specialist represent a contraindication to ranibizumab use in the patient or
             may represent an unwarranted patient risk.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt;160 mmHg and/or diastolic &gt;100 mmHg while
             sitting)

          -  Current systemic infectious disease or a therapy for active infectious disease

          -  Pregnant or lactating
