      The purpose of these studies is to evaluate the experimental approaches and device designs,
      in order to improve diagnostic performance of the RDT only. The results from the enhanced
      RDT methodology will be not be shared with patients or care providers, since they are as of
      yet, unproven.

    <textblock>
      Populations at risk for malaria infection need diagnostic technologies that are reliable and
      sensitive in settings without electricity, clean water, or highly trained technicians. Macha
      Research Trust and Zambia Ministry of Health are collaborating to identify and treat
      low-level and asymptomatic malaria infections and evaluate elimination strategies. The
      VZNIGHT research program will focus on development of technologies and approaches to
      facilitate diagnosis and evaluation of asymptomatic malaria using high sensitivity, point of
      care diagnostic technologies. The diagnostic technologies in development are now
      sufficiently mature that a transition from laboratory-synthesized samples to primary human
      specimens collected in the field is necessary to advance their development.

      Specific Aim: The investigators will evaluate approaches using magnetic bead capture,
      isolation, and surface tension valve transfer of biomarkers to improve the sensitivity of
      already approved RDTs for detection of malaria infection. Results will be compared to those
      obtained using unenhanced capillary blood specimens directly applied to approved malaria
      RDTs (the current standard of care).

      The purpose of these studies is to evaluate the experimental approaches and device designs
      in a field setting, in order to improve diagnostic performance of the RDT only. Anonymous,
      finger-prick blood specimens will be collected from individuals consenting to the study who
      have been advised to undergo a malaria rapid diagnostic test as part of standard clinical
      practice or public health surveillance. The results from the enhanced RDT methodology will
      be not be shared with patients or care providers, since they are as of yet, unproven.

      Results from rapid diagnostic tests that are approved for clinical use by international and
      national governing bodies and that are administered at the same time as part of the typical
      standard of care, will be shared with study participants by the administering clinician or
      their representative in the clinical setting. Individuals who test positive for malaria
      infection using standard RDT methods will receive standard of care treatment administered by
      an authorized care provider.

        Since this study only uses a fingerprick blood specimen obtained at the same time as a
        routine rapid diagnostic test for malaria, there are no absolute contra-indications for
        such a test. However, the following criteria will apply for the study purposes.
