  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether human-papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling
      can be used as a primary screening test for unscreened women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women residing in the canton of Geneva, aged between 25 and 69 years, who haven't had a Pap
      test in the last three years, will be invited to participate. Participation to the study
      will be encouraged through public displays, social networks, and medical consultations.
      Women meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study. They will be
      randomized into two groups and will receive a home-sent letter, inviting them to either come
      in for a Pap test or to perform and send back the HPV self-sample that they'll receive at
      their domicile. Both groups will also receive a questionnaire, in order to better understand
      the reasons for their previous non-attendance to cervical cancer screening.
