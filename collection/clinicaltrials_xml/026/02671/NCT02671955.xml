  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-61610588 in
      participants with advanced cancer in order to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)
      for further evaluation in specific tumor types.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if JNJ-61610588 is safe and useful for treating
      participants with advanced cancer. This study consists of up to 4 parts. Part 1 will
      determine what dose of JNJ-61610588 can be given safely to advanced cancer participants.
      Part 2 will look at how participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer respond to a
      safe dose of JNJ-61610588. Parts 3 and 4 will test whether the dose of JNJ-61610588
      identified in Part 1 is a safe and effective therapy for participants with specific types of
      advanced cancers (lung, pancreas, cervical, colorectal, head and neck). Participants will
      receive study drug in an outpatient setting. Participants safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
