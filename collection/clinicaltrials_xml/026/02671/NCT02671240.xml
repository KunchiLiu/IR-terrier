      Our hypothesis is that the conventional treatment of Behavioral Addiction in Parkinson's
      disease is often not effective, and that affects the motor aspects (worsening akinéto-rigid
      syndrome and / or worsening of dyskinesia due to higher levodopa doses to compensate for the
      drop in behavioral addictions) and non-motor (withdrawal syndrome dopamine agonist)
      anxiously including apathy.

      Our goal is to describe the natural history of Behavioral Addiction under the effect of the
      evolution of the disease and adapt treatment according to the prior art, through a study of
      a larger population of patients than in the few published studies.
