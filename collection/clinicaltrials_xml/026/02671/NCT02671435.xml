    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, PK, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of
      Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in combination with IPH2201 in Adult Subjects with selected advanced
      solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-arm dose-escalation and dose-expansion
      study of durvalumab in combination with IPH2201 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK,
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity in adult subjects with selected
      advanced solid tumors. The study consists of 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

      Subjects will receive durvalumab and IPH2201 via 2 separate IV infusions. Subjects will
      receive durvalumab and IPH2201 until unacceptable toxicity, documentation of confirmed
      progressive disease (PD), or documentation of subject withdrawal for another reason.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have histologic documentation of advanced recurrent or metastatic
             cancer.

          2. Subjects must have received and have progressed or are refractory to at least one
             line of standard systemic therapy in the recurrent/metastatic setting, with selected
             advanced solid tumors.

          3. Subjects must have at least one lesion that is measurable by RECIST v1.1 Exclusion
             Criteria

        1. Prior treatment with immunotherapy agents. Prior treatment with antitumor vaccines may
        be permitted upon discussion with the medical monitor.

        2. Prior participation in clinical studies that include durvalumab alone or in
        combination, where the study has registrational intent and the analyses for the primary
        endpoint have not yet been completed 3. Receipt of any conventional or investigational
        anticancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of durvalumab and IPH2201 4. Any
        concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment.
        Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer-related conditions is acceptable. Local
        treatment of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable beyond the
        DLT-evaluation period with prior consultation and in agreement with the medical monitor.
        5. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
        dose.
