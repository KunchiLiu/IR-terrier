    <textblock>
      This study will develop and assess an innovative, high-reach, easily implementable, low-cost
      computer-delivered intervention (Safe and Healthy Experiences; The SHE Program) that will
      address known barriers in early identification and intervention with sheltered battered
      women with IPV (intimate partner violence) and substance use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) and substance use are significant and interconnected public
      health problems facing women. For battered women, the presence of substance use increases
      the risk of revictimization and the risk of more severe abuse. Battered women's shelters
      provide emergency shelter to approximately 300,000 women and children each year. A prime
      time to intervene with battered women might be when they enter a shelter and have already
      initiated a change in their lives. A shelter-based intervention for battered women that
      addresses substance use problems might reduce the risk of substance use, reduce the risk of
      future IPV, and improve utilization of substance use treatment and community resources. The
      objective of this R34 Award is to develop and assess an innovative, easily implementable,
      low-cost, computer-delivered intervention, the SHE Program (Safe and Healthy Experiences)
      that will address known barriers in early identification and intervention for battered
      sheltered women with substance use issues. SHE will be based on motivational interviewing
      (MI) a well-defined intervention strategy that has yielded particularly promising results in
      a range of clinical issues and a range of patient populations, including substance using
      women. MI is consistent with an empowerment model, which is a highly recommended
      intervention model for victimized women. The R34 proposes two distinct phases to assess the
      SHE Program with battered sheltered women with substance use issues. During the Development
      Phase, the research team will conduct focus groups and develop the intervention to meet the
      needs of our target group, develop the software for the computer-delivered intervention, and
      conduct an open trial with 10 participants. During the Pilot Study Phase, the investigators
      will conduct a two-group, randomized controlled study with a sample of 50 battered sheltered
      women who report substance use difficulties within the last three months, which will provide
      the necessary groundwork to examine the efficacy of the SHE Program in a future, large
      clinical trial. If the SHE Program is found to be feasible, acceptable and efficacious in
      improving outcomes for our vulnerable target population, the program has the potential to be
      widely disseminated while maintaining treatment fidelity across battered women shelters and
      may hold promise for IPV populations with substance use difficulties in other settings.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol and Substance Use: Timeline Follow-back (TLFB)-modified computer version</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months post shelter</time_frame>
    <description>The computer-based TLFB will assess drug use and heavy drinking (4+ standard drinks) days for the past week and the past 90 days. For primary analysis, days using drugs and heavy drinking days will be combined to create a single variable that reflects the total number of days that women used drugs or had 4+ drinks. The primary outcome is substance use (heavy drinking or drug using) days over a 6 month post shelter period. We are assessing the change of this number from baseline, 3 months post shelter, and 6 months post shelter.</description>

    <measure>The Treatment Services Review (TSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and again at 3 and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Services Review will be used to assess total days of substance use services (both treatment and self-help utilization) received (including outpatient, day patient, residential treatment, NA, AA) to capture the extent to which women are reaching out to access recovery-related resources. The TSR will assess total days of substance use services received for a 90 day window.</description>

    <measure>The Composite Abuse Scale (CAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and again at 3 and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The CAS is a widely used self-report of behaviors scale with 4 subscales that measure severe, combined abuse, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and harassment. The CAS has recently been published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compendium of intimate partner violence measures. It consists of 30 items presented in a six point format requiring respondents to answer &quot;never&quot;, &quot;only once&quot;, &quot;several times&quot;, &quot;monthly&quot;, &quot;weekly&quot; or &quot;daily&quot; in a twelve month period.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and again at 3 and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The Cyber Stalking Scale measure is a 6 -item measure and assesses the use of technologies in stalking and harassment.</description>

    <measure>Safety Behavior Checklist (SBC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and again at 3 and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Safety Behavior Checklist (SBC) has 15 items that assess the use of strategies suggested to keep victim safe (e.g., hiding money and extra clothing).</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a 50 minute intervention on the Tablet PC or computer immediately after their baseline assessment and a 15 minute &quot;booster&quot; session on the computer within 2 months after the intervention. There will also be a 3 and 6 month follow-up after completion of the SHE program.</description>

    <description>Control condition will consist of a series of questions regarding television show preferences and viewing a brief series of videos of popular entertainers/shows, with subsequent requests for rating of subjective preference. Participants in this condition will complete a baseline assessment as well as a booster and follow-up assessment 3 and 6 months later.</description>

    <description>The SHE program will be specifically tailored, innovative and relevant to diverse, racial, and ethnic sheltered, battered women in a number of ways including the images and content used in the intervention. It will also be tailored to participants' alcohol or substance use status, and be designed to reach participants across levels of motivation for change. The content of SHE will be theory-driven, consistent with the motivational interviewing model of behavior, and consistent with the literature on effective interventions that address IPV and substance use.</description>
