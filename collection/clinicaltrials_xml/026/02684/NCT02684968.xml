  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 without stratification to bilateral continuous QL
      catheters with local anesthetic continuous infusion (QL block + IV patient-controlled
      analgesia group) or normal saline continuous infusion (IV patient-controlled analgesia
      group).

      In the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), patients will be given intravenous boluses of
      hydromorphone or fentanyl as needed. Following immediate recovery from anesthesia, patients
      will be provided with a hydromorphone IV patient-controlled analgesia pump with standard
      initial settings and an option of clinician dose for breakthrough pain. IV
      patient-controlled hydromorphone pump settings will be titrated to comfort level (pain
      score&lt;4) by blinded clinicians.

      On the nursing floor, patients will also receive scheduled boluses of of 10 mL 0.1%
      bupivacaine or normal saline from the pump every 4 hours. These scheduled boluses (clinician
      dose) will be administered by the nurse using the medication from the pump.

      If patient agrees ViSi mobile (Sotera Wireless) patient monitoring system will be used to
      continuously record noninvasive blood pressure, patient activity, posture, 3-lead ECG,
      oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. Data will be recorded at one-minute intervals and
      downloaded daily to a laptop.

      Opioid consumption first 72 hours or until discharge, whichever comes first will be
      recorded.

      Pain scores during first 72 hours or until discharge, whichever comes first will be recorded
      with a verbal rating scale and obtained from the patient's electronic medical records.

      The morning of post operative day 1 and post operative day 3 the ORSDS and QOR surveys will
      be completed.

      Morning of the day of discharge, the overall patient satisfaction with pain management
      survey will be completed.

    <description>primary hypothesis is that bilateral continuous QL local anesthetic infusion with IV PCA reduces total opioid consumption and/or time-weighted average pain scores during 72 hours after surgery compared to patients under IV PCA alone, and not worse on either outcome. In other words, IV PCA + QL block is superior to IV PCA alone, resulting in lower opioid consumption and/or less pain and not worse on either outcome.</description>
