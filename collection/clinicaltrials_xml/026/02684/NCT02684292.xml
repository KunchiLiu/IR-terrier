    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in the treatment of
      participants with relapsed or refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. Participants will be
      randomized to receive either pembrolizumab or brentuximab vedotin for up to 35 three-week
      cycles of treatment.

      The primary hypotheses of this study are that treatment with pembrolizumab prolongs
      Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in participants with relapsed or
      refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma compared to treatment with brentuximab vedotin.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has relapsed (disease progression after most recent therapy) or refractory (failure
             to achieve Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) to most recent therapy)
             Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma and meets one of the following criteria:

               1. Has failed to achieve a response or progressed after autologous stem cell
                  transplant (auto-SCT). Participants must not have had previous treatment with
                  brentuximab vedotin.

               2. Is not an auto-SCT candidate due to: chemo-resistant disease (unable to achieve
                  CR or PR to salvage chemotherapy), advanced age (≥65 years of age), or any
                  significant coexisting medical condition (cardiac, renal, pulmonary, or hepatic
                  dysfunction) likely to have a negative impact on tolerability of auto-SCT.
                  Participants &lt;65 years of age who refuse auto-SCT are not eligible for this
                  study. Note: Sponsor review and approval of participants &lt;65 years of age who
                  are not auto-SCT candidates are required before randomization. Participants must
                  have received at least 2 prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens that did not
                  include brentuximab vedotin.

          -  Has measureable disease defined as ≥1 lesion that can be accurately measured in at
             least 2 dimensions with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan. Minimum measurement
             must be &gt;15 mm in the longest diameter or &gt;10 mm in the short axis.

          -  Is able to provide an evaluable core or excisional lymph node biopsy for biomarker
             analysis from an archival or newly obtained biopsy at Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Scale.

          -  Has adequate organ function

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate
             method of contraception for the course of the study through 180 days after the last
             dose of study drug.

          -  Male participant of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method
             of contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through 180 days after
             the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received previous treatment with brentuximab vedotin.

          -  Has hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients in
             brentuximab vedotin.

          -  Is currently participating in a study of an investigational agent and is currently
             receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent
             and has received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of
             the first dose of study drug.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunosuppression or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study drug.

          -  Has had a prior monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study
             drug in the study or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from
             adverse events (AEs) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from AEs due to a previously administered agent. Note: If a participant
             received major surgery, he/she must have recovered adequately from the toxicity
             and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting study drug.

          -  Has undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within the
             last 5 years. Note: Participants who have had a transplant greater than 5 years ago

             neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline) and have no evidence of new or
             enlarging brain metastases.

             immunosuppressive drugs).

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or current
