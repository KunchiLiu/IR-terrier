      The purpose of this chart review is to assess outcomes in subjects that received MAGNIFUSE
      in the posterolateral lumbar spine at 1 or 2 continuous levels from L1-S1.

    <description>Fusion status will be assessed using the Lenke posterior fusion criteria below:
Grade I: Solid trabeculated transverse process and facet fusions bilaterally.
Grade II: Thick fusion mass on one side, and difficult to visualize on the other side.
Grade III: Suspected lucency or defect in the fusion mass.
Grade IV: Definite resorption of graft with fatigue of instrumentation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject's medical record must contain the following for the subject to be included:

          1. Posterolateral surgical procedure using MAGNlFUSE with local autograft and/or iliac
             crest bone graft at one or two continuous lumbar levels from L1-S1.

          2. Radiographs available for fusion assessment by clinician at 12 and/or 24 month
             post-surgery visits.

          3. Subject must be at least 18 years old at the time of index procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject data will be excluded from this study if the medical record indicates:

          1. Additional surgical treatment adjacent to the initial lumbar levels treated per
             Inclusion Criterion 1.

          2. Infection at index level(s) at time of surgery.

          3. Extant tumor (evident at any level), spinal metastasis, or spinal tumor at the time
             of surgery.

          4. Pregnant at time of surgery.

          5. Surgery is due to trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accident or high impact fall).

          6. Use of growth factors or growth peptide (BMP2, BMP7, or iFactor) in the index-level
             fusion surgery.

          7. Procedure is a revision surgery for previously failed fusion at the surgery index
             level(s).

          8. Subjects with body mass index &gt; 40 at the time of surgery.
