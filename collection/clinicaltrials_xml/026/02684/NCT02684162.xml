    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving donor lymphocyte cells and
      SGI-110 will help control acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
      in patients who have had an allogeneic stem cell transplant (using someone else's stem
      cells) and have relapsed. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.

      Study Treatment Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive SGI-110 as an
      injection under the skin 1 time a day on Days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle. Day 1 is the first
      day you will receive the study drug.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, your dose of SGI-110 may be changed or stopped during the
      study.

      On Day 6 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, you will receive a donor lymphocyte infusion by vein over
      about 10-30 minutes.

      Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) may occur after the T-cell infusion. GVHD occurs when donor
      cells attack the cells of the person receiving the stem cell transplant. If GVHD occurs, you
      will be given standard drugs that may help control GVHD. You may ask the study staff for
      information about how the drugs are given and their risks. You cannot continue to receive
      the study drug until the GVHD is controlled. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Study Visits:

      Within 3 days before the start of each cycle, on Day 3 of each cycle, and then one time
      during Weeks 2 and 3 of each cycle (if the doctor thinks it is needed), blood (about 2
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your kidney and liver function.
      Part of this blood sample will be used for a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.
      Urine may also be collected for this pregnancy test.

      You may be able to have these blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic closer to your
      home. The results of these tests will be sent to the study doctor at MD Anderson for review.
      Talk with the study doctor about this possibility.

      On Day 28 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for chimerism studies, which looks to see how
           much the blood cells mixed between the donor and recipient. This test shows how well
           the lymphocyte infusion has &quot;taken.&quot;

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
           performed to check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow
           aspiration/biopsy, an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of
           bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle.

      These tests/procedures may be performed more often, if you doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive up to 12 cycles of SGI-110. You may be taken off study early if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if you develop uncontrolled or severe GVHD,
      or if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      This is an investigational study. SGI-110 is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      SGI-110 is made with decitabine, which is FDA approved and commercially available to treat
      MDS. SGI-110 is currently being used for research purposes only. The use of donor
      lymphocytes to treat MDS and AML is FDA approved.

      Up to 50 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
