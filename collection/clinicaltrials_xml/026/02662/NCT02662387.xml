  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure secondary to bronchiolitis and asthma is one of the most common
      diagnoses in children admitted to pediatric intensive care unit.

      Objectives: The primary outcome of the study is to compare the respiratory parameters
      between patients on HFNC and HFNC with ENDs.

      Methods: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. All children admitted to Loma
      Linda University Children's Hospital due to acute respiratory failure secondary to
      bronchiolitis and asthma are eligible for inclusion in the study. Multiple respiratory
      parameters will be collected as part of the study. The investigators anticipate that use of
      END will have a positive impact on the respiratory status of children with acute respiratory
      failure. Appropriate statistical analysis of the data will occur after the data has been
      de-identified.

      Acute respiratory failure secondary to bronchiolitis is one of the most common diagnoses in
      children admitted to pediatric intensive care unit.

      Objectives: The primary outcome of the study is to compare the respiratory parameters
      between patients on high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and HFNC with an external nasal dilator
      (END).

      Methods: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. All children admitted to Loma
      Linda University Children's Hospital between July 2015 and May 2017 for approximately 22
      months due to acute respiratory failure secondary to bronchiolitis are eligible for
      inclusion in the study. Two arms will be studied, one with HFNC and the other with HFNC and
      ENDS. Modified Bronchiolitis Severity Score will be used to assess respiratory parameters as
      part of the study. The investigators anticipate that use of END will have a positive impact
      on the respiratory status of children with acute respiratory failure. Appropriate
      statistical analysis of the data will occur after the data has been de-identified.
