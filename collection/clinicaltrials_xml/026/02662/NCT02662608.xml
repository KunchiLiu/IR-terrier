    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to start treatment with the NOTCH1 inhibitor brontictuzumab in an
      attempt to control tumors and prolong survival. The therapy involves participant being given
      the drug brontictuzumab to treat adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) with NOTCH 1 mutations. This
      is considered an investigational treatment.

      Treatment:

      Participant will receive brontictuzumab by vein over 30 minutes one time every 3 weeks.

      Clinic Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 and then every 3 weeks from then on:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 6 weeks, participant will have an MRI and CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may continue taking brontictuzumab for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the drug if the disease gets
      worse, they develop another illness that prevents receiving more treatment, or if
      intolerable side effects occur.

      Brontictuzumab is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for
      research purposes only.
