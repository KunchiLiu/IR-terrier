  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AML is a disease of older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 67 years . An estimated
      13,410 new cases of AML will be diagnosed in 2007. Survival for AML is age-dependent, with
      significantly lower survival rates reported for older adults. SEER statistics from 1996-2003
      show a 5 year relative survival rate of 34.4% for adults younger than 65 and 4.3% for those
      ≥65 years of age 1. Clinical trials have demonstrated worse survival outcomes in older
      adults with AML using age cutoffs of 55, 60 and 65 years. Older adults have also experienced
      increased toxicity to standard therapies in clinical trials. Chronologic age cutoffs have
      therefore been used in research and clinical practice due to concerns regarding toxicity
      associated with treatment. The reasons for the increased toxicity and decreased survival in
      older adults with AML is incompletely understood and likely multifactorial including both
      tumor specific and host specific factors. Improving understanding of which measurable
      clinical characteristics predict vulnerability to toxicity will help refine the research and
      clinical approach to older adults with AML.

    <description>The study intervention consists of a bedside functional assessment to be administered to eligible, consented subjects who are hospitalized with a new diagnosis of AML or are undergoing workup for suspected AML diagnosis. All subjects will be enrolled within 5 days of admission to the hospital for known or suspected AML or within 5 days of new confirmed diagnosis of AML obtained during a hospitalization for other indications. All measures will be performed by a trained examiner during a face to face interview.
Bedside assessment measures will be repeated once for subjects who complete induction chemotherapy within 2-8 weeks post discharge from initial hospitalization.</description>
