  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to validate uHear™, an iOS-based tool, as a screening tool to
      detect significant hearing impairment as part of a comprehensive geriatric assessment in
      patients aged 70 years and older. The pass or fail screening cut-off is defined as having
      two or more consecutive hearing grades starting from the moderate-severe threshold zone
      ranging from 0.5 - 2.0 kHz.
