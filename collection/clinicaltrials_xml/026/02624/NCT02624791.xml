    <textblock>
      Small amounts of astigmatism are often uncorrected in contact lens wearers. The effect with
      respect to driving is unknown, but it could threaten safe operation of a motor vehicle,
      especially under conditions such as nighttime driving when visual abilities are highly
      challenged. This study measures driving-specific visual abilities and simulated driving
      performance in participants with astigmatism who either have or do not have their
      astigmatism corrected. The primary hypothesis is that at a tactical level, contact lenses
      correcting for astigmatism will result in safer driving performance overall. The secondary
      hypothesis is that at an operational level, contact lenses correcting for astigmatism will
      result in better driving-specific visual performance.

      Safe driving relies heavily on &quot;good vision.&quot; Good vision while driving relates to multiple
      abilities, such as dynamic visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, management of glare and
      peripheral vision, etc. While spherical contact lenses address issues of correction of
      visual acuity as determined by forward static vision tests, if they do not provide visual
      acuity both immediately and smoothly with eye movement then vision can be compromised. Glare
      can be a problem as well when contact lenses are off center. Fluctuating vision as a result
      of lens movement on the eye could be especially problematic and frustrating for patients who
      have astigmatism. Furthermore, experiencing moments of blurred vision no matter how brief
      can be potentially hazardous while driving. The 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST for ASTIGMATISM contact
      lenses have a unique blink-activated stabilization system to prevent rotation of the lens on
      the eye, and may have significant visual advantages for drivers with astigmatism. These
      lenses provide continuous corrected acuity compared to non-ballasted contact lenses, and
      thus are potentially safer for driving. Contact comparison will consist of 1*DAY ACUVUE®
      MOIST (spherical control) versus 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST for ASTIGMATISM (the daily disposable
      astigmatism alternative).

      The study will investigate the potential advantages of contact lenses specifically designed
      to correct for astigmatism, compared to similar correction with spherical contacts, for
      adult licensed drivers with astigmatism, employing a double-blind (subjects and research
      assistant blind to hypotheses), randomized, cross-over design (spherical, vs. astigmatism
      contacts). This will be a multi-stage study comprised of the following:

      Preliminary study to determine the likelihood of detecting a significant difference between
      the standard spherical and astigmatism contacts in a full Randomize Clinical Trial (n=12;
      data and power analysis)
