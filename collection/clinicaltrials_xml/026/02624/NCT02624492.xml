  <brief_title>To Determine the Dose of BI 836826-GemOx and the Efficacy of BI 836826-GemOx Versus R-GemOx in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory DLBCL</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open Label Multicenter Phase Ib/II Trial to Determine the Dose of BI 836826 in Combination With Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin (GemOx) and the Efficacy of BI 836826-GemOx Versus Rituximab (R)- GemOx (R-GemOx) in Patients With Relapsed/ Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Who Are Not Eligible for, or Have Relapsed/Progressed After Autologous/Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives are to establish the MTD of BI836826 -GemOx and thereafter to compare
      the efficacy as Overall response (OR) based on the central review assessments of BI 836826-
      GemOx and R-GemOx in patients with relapsed DLBCL. The secondary objectives are to evaluate
      the pharmacokinetics of BI 836826 in combination with GemOx and to investigate and compare
      the efficacy as CR by way of central review assessments for BI 836-GemOx and R-GemOx in
      patients with relapsed DLBCL.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed, relapsed/refractory, diffuse large B-cell
             lymphoma (including transformed follicular lymphoma) who have received an
             anti-CD20-supplemented, anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and are not eligible
             for high dose therapy followed by an autologous stem cell transplant, or have
             relaspsed/progressed after autologous/allogenic stem cell transplant. Allogenic stem
             cell transplant performed at least 6 months prior to study entry is allowed if
             patients do not require immunosuppressive treatment and have no evidence of active
             graft-versus-host disease.

          -  Patient has not received anti-lymphoma treatment prior to the first dose of trial
             medication: within past 14 days or within time that is shorter or equal to 5
             half-lives of the drug if the last anti-lymphoma treatment contained an
             investigational agent

          -  Screening computer tomography (CT) scan with involvement of 2 or more clearly
             demarcated lesions/nodes with a long axis &gt;1.5cm

          -  Screening [18F] flourodeoxyglucose (FDG)- positron emission tomography (PET) scans
             must demonstrate positive lesion compatible with computer tomography (CT) defined
             anatomical tumor sites

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, 2

          -  Written signed informed consent consistent with ICH GCP and local legislation

          -  Patients must have an acceptable organ function

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be ready and able to use highly effective
             methods of birth control per ICH M3(R2) that result in a low failure rate of less
             than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Non-vasectomized male patients
             having a female sexual partner of childbearing potential must ensure their partner is
             using a highly effective method of birth control as described above, during the trial
             and for at least 12 months after the end of the trial.

          -  Eligible for curative salvage high dose therapy followed by stem cell transplant

          -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma or known Central nervous system (CNS)
             involvement

             carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix or breast which has
             been treated with curative therapy. Other prior malignancies are allowed only if
             patient has been free of disease and without treatment other than hormones for at
             least past three years.

          -  Refractory to gemcitabine and/or oxaliplatin

             alopecia)

          -  Significant concurrent medical disease or condition which according to the
             investigators judgment would either compromise patient safety or interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety of the test drug. e.g. symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy with the exception of
             extra systoles of minor conduction abnormalities

          -  An infection requiring treatment at the start of the trial medication.

          -  Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or laboratory evidence for a chronic infection or
             HIV infection (test results done in routine diagnostics are acceptable if done within
             14 days before the first study treatment dose)

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the
             trial.This includes the female sexual partners of a male participant
