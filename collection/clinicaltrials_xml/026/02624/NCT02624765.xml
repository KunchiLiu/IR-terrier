  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies are specifically designed to address health concerns relevant during pregnancy.
      The consequence is a lack of evidence on best clinical practice. This includes mothers and
      their babies when pregnancy is complicated by an abnormally fast heart rate up to 300 beats
      per minute due to supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVA) in the unborn baby (fetus).
      Although fetal SVA, including atrial flutter (AF) and other forms of supraventricular
      tachycardia (SVT), is the most common cause of intended in-utero fetal therapy, none of the
      medication used to date has been evaluated for their effects on the mother and her baby in a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). As a consequence, physicians need to make decisions about
      the management of such pregnancies without any evidence from controlled trials on drug
      efficacy and safety and no consensus among specialists for the optimal management. The Fetal
      Atrial Flutter and Supraventricular Tachycardia (FAST) Therapy Trial is a prospective
      multi-center trial that addresses this knowledge gap to guide future fetal SVA therapy to
      the best of care. Study components of FAST include three prospective sub-studies to
      determine the efficacy and safety of commonly used transplacental drug regimens in
      suppressing fetal AF without hydrops (RCT A), SVT without hydrops (RCT B), and SVT with
      hydrops (RCT C). All RCTs are open label phase III trials of standard 1st line therapy,
      which either is started as monotherapy (no hydrops) or as dual therapy (hydrops). The
      primary study aim is the probability of a normal pregnancy outcome after treatment start
      with Digoxin or Sotalol (AF without hydrops); Digoxin or Flecainide (SVT without hydrops);
      and Digoxin plus Sotalol or Digoxin plus Flecainide (SVT with hydrops). The study also
      includes the possibility to enroll non-randomized subjects into a prospective Registry to
      document the outcome of alternative management.
