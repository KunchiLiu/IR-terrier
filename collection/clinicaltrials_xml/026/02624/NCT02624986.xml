  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of idasanutlin in
      combination with obinutuzumab in participants with relapsed or refractory FL or DLBCL.
      Participants with FL who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable
      disease (SD) at the end of induction therapy (EOI) will be eligible for post-induction
      treatment with obinutuzumab.
