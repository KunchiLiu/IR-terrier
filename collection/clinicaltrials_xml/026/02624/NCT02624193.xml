    <textblock>
      Preliminary data from the investigators' NCCAM-funded R21 on mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) in HIV-infected youth suggest an association between mindfulness and
      improved self-regulation and medication adherence. This randomized, controlled trial will
      help the investigators to better understand the specific impact of MBSR on HIV medication
      and treatment adherence in HIV-infected youth, and the efficacy of MBSR in the amelioration
      of stress and improved self-regulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite remarkable advances in HIV medication effectiveness, adherence to HIV treatment
      recommendations is alarmingly poor, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. It is
      estimated that 26-72% of HIV-infected adolescents are non-adherent to their HIV medications
      and 22-33% are non-adherent with scheduled health care visits. HIV treatment non-adherence
      puts individuals at markedly increased risk for illness related to HIV itself and a variety
      of opportunistic infections, as well as at increased risk of spreading HIV.

      Preliminary data from the investigators' NCCAM-funded R21 on mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) in HIV-infected youth suggest an association between mindfulness and
      improved medication adherence, as well as enhanced self-regulatory processes (coping,
      psychological function, and cognitive function). This three-armed randomized, controlled
      trial will help the investigators to better understand the specific impact of MBSR on HIV
      medication and treatment adherence in HIV-infected youth, and the efficacy of MBSR in the
      amelioration of stress and improved self-regulation.

    <description>MBSR Program:
The MBSR intervention is a nine-week program designed to cultivate mindfulness, a focused non-judgmental awareness of the present moment. It consists of eight 2-hour weekly sessions and one 3-hour retreat and the content includes three main components: 1) material related to mindfulness, meditation, yoga, and the mind-body connection; 2) experiential practice of mindful meditation (sitting, lying down, walking), gentle mindful yoga, and &quot;body scan&quot; during group meetings and encouragement of home practice; and 3) group discussion focused on problem-solving related to barriers to effective practice. HIV disease will not be discussed as a group topic, unless it is brought up by participants.</description>

    <description>Healthy Topics Program:
The health education program &quot;Healthy Topics&quot; (HT) will serve as an attention control group. The HT program is focused on providing age-appropriate health information and education. There is minimal content overlap in the MBSR and HT programs regarding self-care and healthy eating; however, the style, structure, and content of the MBSR and HT programs are distinct. HT participants will receive no training in MBSR or meditation. Topics covered include physical activity, nutrition, managing weight, building health, personal care, understanding adolescence, tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. HIV disease will not be discussed as a group topic, unless it is brought up by participants.</description>

Usual Care practices consist of regular medical visits at least every 3 months, which include any or all the following: HIV treatment history, HIV serologies (CD4 count, HIV viral load), social work resources, substance abuse inquiries and resources, mental health resources, sexual history, risk reduction counseling, and case management.</description>
