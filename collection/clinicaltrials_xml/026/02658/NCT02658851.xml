  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study protocol will evaluate the efficacy of Bovie Medical's J-Plasma® helium based
      plasma technology in the reduction of lymphoceles following pelvic lymph node dissection
      (PLND) during robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). The J-Plasma® handpiece will be
      used during the PLND by dissecting the lymph nodes and sealing the lymphatic channels to
      prevent lymph leakage.

      Participants evaluated and scheduled for a PLND during Robotic Assisted Radical
      Prostatectomy who have met the study inclusion criteria and who have also given informed
      consent will be enrolled. Enrolled participants will have their PLND performed using
      J-Plasma® for dissection and sealing of lymphatic channels. An abdominal-pelvic ultrasound
      will be completed at a follow-up period ranging from 4-12 weeks post operatively to
      determine if a lymphocele is present. The occurrence rate of lymphoceles in this trial group
      will be compared to retrospective data from the principal investigator's practice and other
      published data to determine if the occurrence rate has been reduced.
