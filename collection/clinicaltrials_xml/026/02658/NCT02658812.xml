      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if talimogene laherparepvec can help to
      control recurrent breast cancer. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Participant will receive the study drug in cycles. Cycle 1 will be 3 weeks and every cycle
      after that will be 2 weeks.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive
      talimogene laherparepvec as an injection into the tumor on Day 1 of each cycle. If the
      doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest, they may also receive injections into
      areas of the skin to which the disease has spread.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, if this has not been done
           in the last 7 days.

        -  At Cycle 2, photographs will be taken of lesions on participant's chest.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 5:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the immune
           system, and for tumor marker testing.

        -  Participant will have a CT or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.
           Participant may have a bone scan, if PET/CT is not available.

        -  Photographs will be taken of any lesions on participant's chest.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a core biopsy to check the
           immune system and to check the status of the disease.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 7 and then every odd numbered cycle after that (Cycles 9, 11, 13, and so
      on):

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Photographs will be taken of any lesions on participant's chest.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 9 and then every 4 cycles after that (Cycles 13, 17, 21, and so on):

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and tumor marker testing.

        -  Participant will have a CT or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.
           Participant may have a bone scan, if PET/CT is not available.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the
      disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After participant's last dose of study drug but before the start of any new treatments,
      blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check their immune system, if possible.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      About 30 days after the end-of-treatment visit and then every 3 months after that for up to
      1 year, participant will have a follow-up visit or phone call to learn how they are doing.
      After 30 days, instead of having a clinic visit, the study staff will review participant's
      medical records. If participant is called, it should take about 2 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of melanoma. It is considered investigational to
      use T-VEC to treat breast cancer. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is
      designed to work.

      Up to 35 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
