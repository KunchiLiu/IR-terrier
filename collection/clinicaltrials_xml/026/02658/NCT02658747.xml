  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center retrospective observational research study collecting data for
      participants initiated on docetaxel for the treatment of relapsed non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) up to 6 years before start of data collection and who have completed/stopped
      docetaxel treatment at least 30 days prior to data collection. The primary goal of this
      study is to describe the percentage of participants with at least one neutropenic sepsis
      (NS) episode following initiation of treatment with single-agent docetaxel. Data will be
      collected until end of docetaxel treatment plus an additional 30 days to allow for
      presentation with toxicity.
