    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate AIR OPTIX® plus HYDRAGLYDE® (AOHG) contact lenses
      compared to AIR OPTIX® AQUA (AOA) contact lenses in overall lens fit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects must not wear any contact lenses prior to the visit on Day 1 (Insertion) for Period
      1 or Day 1 (Insertion) for Period 2. This study will be conducted in the United Kingdom.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects satisfying the &quot;no re-fit&quot; criteria in both eyes</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30, each product</time_frame>
    <description>'No re-fit' criteria are satisfied if an acceptable or optimal overall lens fit that is also within one grade of the habitual lens fit value is achieved.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean ex vivo total cholesterol uptake after 30 days of wear</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30, each product</time_frame>
    <description>The contact lens will be removed from the eye. Cholesterol deposits will be extracted and measured in micrograms per lens.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from insertion in Minimum Protected Area (MPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 0 to Hour 12 on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>A video of the tearfilm in front of the contact lens is recorded behind the Tearscope. MPA will be read from the video as the % area of the lens that is covered by the tear film between two natural blinks. This Outcome Measure is pre-specified for AOHG only.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change from Day 1 in Overall Daily Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Daily comfort will be graded on a 10-point scale, where 1=poor and 10=excellent. Comfort is rated daily via text message at approximately 6hrs of wear for 30 days. This Outcome Measure is pre-specified for AOHG only.</description>
