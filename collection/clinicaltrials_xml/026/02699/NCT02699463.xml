  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to prospectively determine the response to CPAP in patients
      presenting with mild OSA. In many healthcare systems, patients with mild OSA (AHI 5-15) are
      not reimbursed for treatment. Although some evidence exists of the benefits of treating mild
      OSA when scoring as per AASM 2007 criteria, more evidence is needed. The investigators wish
      to add to this pool of knowledge and also increase the inclusion criteria to include the
      AASM 2012 definition of mild OSA. By including the 2012 AASM definition of mild OSA, the
      investigators will add novel information to the field by assessing the benefits of treatment
      in both sub-groups of mild OSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who visit their local sleep service for OSA investigation, and are found to have
      mild OSA (AHI ≤ 15) from an Apnealink polygraphy (PG) home sleep test, scored as per AASM
      2007 and/or AASM 2012, will be invited to take part in the study (pre-screening).

      At the study visit, informed consent, baseline demographics, and standardised questionnaires
      will be administered. Participants will then be randomised to a CPAP treatment group or
      control group.

      After 3 months, participants will be asked to repeat the standardised questionnaires, the
      trial will then be complete and they will return to routine clinical care.
