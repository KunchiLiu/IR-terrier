      An investigator initiated and conducted, multicentre, international, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial to determine the effects of
      a fixed low-dose combination blood pressure lowering pill (&quot;Triple Pill&quot;) on top of standard
      of care on blood pressure control and on time to first occurrence of recurrent stroke in
      patients with a history of acute intracerebral haemorrhage (TRIDENT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most serious and least treatable form of
      stroke, accounting for at least 10% of the 20 million new strokes that occur globally each
      year. Survivors of ICH are at high risk of recurrent ICH and other serious cardiovascular
      events.

      While there is strong evidence that this risk can be reduced by lowering the blood pressure
      (BP) of patients after ICH, many patients with ICH do not receive blood pressure lowering
      long-term unless the blood pressure levels are particularly high, and many do not receive BP
      combination therapy.

      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a combination of fixed
      low-dose generic BP lowering agents as a &quot;Triple Pill&quot; strategy on top of standard of care
      for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with a history of ICH and high normal or
      low grade hypertension in a large-scale, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomised controlled trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (â‰¥18 years) with a history up to 6 months of symptom onset of acute stroke
             caused by primary ICH as confirmed by imaging

          -  Clinically stable, as judged by investigator

          -  Two resting SBP levels measured 5 minutes apart in the range 130-160mmHg recorded in
             a seated position. (Patients with higher SBP can be included if considered by
             attending clinician that management is consistent with local standards of clinical
             practice)

          -  Geographical proximity to the recruiting hospital and/or follow-up medical clinic
             site to allow ready access for in-person clinic visits during follow-up

          -  Provision of written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Taking of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor that cannot be switched to any
             of the following alternatives:

               -  telmisartan 20 or 40mg, amlodipine 2.5 or 5mg, indapamide 1.25 or 2.5mg, or

               -  an equivalent class (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), Calcium Channel
                  Blocker (CCB) or thiazide-like diuretic), or

               -  a beta-blocker

          -  Contraindication to any of the study medications, in the context of currently
             prescribed BP lowering medication

          -  Unable to complete the study procedures and/or follow-up

          -  Females of child bearing age and capability, who are pregnant or breast-feeding, or
             those not using adequate birth control

          -  Emergent side effects that prevent long-term treatment during the 1-4 week active
             run-in phase on open treatment

          -  Any condition that in the opinion of the responsible physician or investigator that
             renders the patient unsuitable for the study (e.g. severe disability [ie modified
             Rankin Score of 4-5] or significant memory or behavioural disorder)
