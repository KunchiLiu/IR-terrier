      This is a 4-week, randomized, double-masked study where subjects will wear bilaterally test
      and control lenses in random succession. The objective is to evaluate materials from
      different suppliers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          3. The subject must be at least 18 and not more than 70 years of age (including 70).

          4. The subject's refractive cylinder must be &lt; 0.75 Diopters (D) in each eye.

          5. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye.

          6. The subject must be a habitual and adapted wearer of ACUVUE® OASYS® brand contact
             lens in both eyes (at least 1 month of daily wear).

          7. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

          8. The subject's required spherical contact lens prescription must be in the range of
             -1.00 D to -6.00 D in each eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will
             be discontinued).

          2. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          3. Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication that may interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          4. Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia.

          5. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
             photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK),
             etc.)

          6. Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          7. Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to OPTI-FREE® PureMoist® Contact Lens
             Solution.

          8. Any ocular infection.

          9. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

         10. Monovision or multi-focal contact lens correction.

         11. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14 days
             prior to study enrollment.

         12. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus.

         13. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g., HIV, by self-report).

         14. Suspicion of or recent history of alcohol or substance abuse.

         15. History of serious mental illness.

         16. History of seizures.
