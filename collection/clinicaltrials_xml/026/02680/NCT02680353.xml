  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the postoperative analgesic efficiency of bilateral superficial plexus block,
      patients are divided into two groups. Study group received bilateral superficial plexus
      block, where control had none. Visual analog scale, opioid consumption and presence of
      nausea-vomiting are recorded.

      Bilateral superficial cervical plexus block has successfully been demonstrated to provide an
      efficient analgesia in patients with thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, carotis
      end-arterectomy. The present study is aimed to investigate the intraoperative hemodynamic
      responses, anesthetic and analgesic consumption, and postoperative recovery quality of
      bilateral superficial cervical plexus block in patients with total thyroidectomy. After
      approval, patients enrolled in the study is invited to complete the Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale questionnaire. Patients are divided into two groups by computer-based randomization
      technique as control and study group. After standard monitorization, anesthesia induction
      and tracheal intubation, bilateral superficial cervical plexus block is performed to study
      group and no intervention to control group. At the end of the operation all patients
      received paracetamol 1 gr intravenous. In postoperative period, visual analog scale values,
      opioid consumption, presence of nausea-vomiting, anti-emetic usage or any other
      complications are recorded.
