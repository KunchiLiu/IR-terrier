  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men with oligometastatic prostate cancer lesions will be randomized (1:2) to observation
      versus SBRT. The study will NOT be blinded. Within three weeks of the initial treatment
      planning, SBRT (1-5 fractions) will be administered.

      This research is being done to determine if we can improve the outcome of prostate cancer
      patients who have failed primary treatment - surgery or local radiation to the prostate -
      and have 3 or fewer bone metastases. Patients with metastatic prostate cancer disease will
      usually be placed on hormonal therapy which can work well for a period of time, but hormonal
      therapy can have side effects that greatly trouble men. Any effort to delay the start of
      hormonal therapy would be an advantage to the patient. Radiation treatment usually takes
      many weeks to deliver and is not given in a high enough doses to metastases to prevent them
      from coming back locally. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is highly focused
      radiation, given in a very dose intensive fashion and delivered in usually less than one
      week. Stereotactic body radiation has been shown to be very effective on bone metastases.
      Therefore, we are studying the effects of stereotactic body radiation treatment on patients
      with five or fewer prostate cancer bone metastases to determine if we can stall the use of
      hormonal therapy and/or prevent other bone metastases from developing elsewhere in the body.

      We will also use an investigational radioactive drug called 18F-DCFPyL can help us find
      cancer that has spread (metastatic disease) from its original site in people who have cancer
      in their prostate to other parts of their body.
