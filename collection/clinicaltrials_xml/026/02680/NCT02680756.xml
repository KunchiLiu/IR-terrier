      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of ferric maltol and intravenous iron
      (IVI) Ferric Carboxy Maltose in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and
      subsequent maintenance of haemoglobin in subjects with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

      A phase 3b, randomized, controlled, multicentre study with oral ferric maltol or intravenous
      iron (FCM), for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in subjects with inflammatory bowel
      disease.

      Approximately 242 eligible subjects will be randomised (1:1) to receive one of the following
      treatments for the duration of the study treatment period (52 weeks):

        -  Oral ferric maltol, 30 mg capsule bid.

        -  Intravenous iron (ferric carboxy maltose) as per SPC

      In the FCM arm IV iron treatment will be repeated if the subject is iron deficient at any of
      the study visits.

      Subject participation in the study will consist of 3 periods:

        -  Screening: Up to 14 days

        -  Randomised Treatment: 52 weeks

        -  Post-treatment safety follow-up: 14 days after study medication discontinuation

      Primary efficacy and safety of ferric maltol and Intravenous iron (ferric carboxy maltose)
      will be evaluated after the first 12 weeks.

      End of study evaluations will occur at Week 52 or premature discontinuation.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All of the following criteria must be met to randomize a subject in the study:

          1. Subjects must be competent to understand the information given in the Independent
             Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent
             form and must sign and date the informed consent prior to any study mandated
             procedure

          2. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with study requirements

          3. Age ≥ 18 years

          4. Subjects must have a confirmed diagnosis of IBD (endoscopic and/or biopsy)

          5. Subjects must have documented intolerance of oral ferrous products, or considered not
             suitable for oral ferrous products, and would be considered by the Investigator
             suitable for intravenous iron treatment

          6. Subjects must have iron deficiency anaemia defined by the following criteria:

               1. Hb ≥8.0 g/dL and &lt;11.0 g/dL for women OR a Hb ≥8.0 g/dL and &lt;12.0 g/dL for men

               2. AND Ferritin &lt;30ng/ml OR Ferritin &lt;100 ng/ml WITH Transferrin saturation (TSAT)
                  &lt;20%.

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential (including perimenopausal females who have
             had a menstrual period within 1 year prior to screening) must agree to use a reliable
             method of contraception until study completion and for at least 4 weeks following
             their final study visit. Reliable contraception is defined as a method which results
             in a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year when used consistently and
             correctly, such as implants, injectables, some intrauterine contraceptive devices
             (IUDs), complete sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner. Oral contraceptive
             medications are allowed in this study. Female subjects who are surgically sterile
             (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or postmenopausal
             (defined as no menstrual period within 1 year of screening) are also allowed to
             participate.

        A subject who meets any of the following criteria is not eligible for participation in the
        study.

          1. Subject with anaemia due to any cause other than iron deficiency, including, but not
             limited to,

               1. Untreated or untreatable severe malabsorption syndrome

               2. Immunosuppressant use. Immunosuppressants taken at a stable dose for 3 months
                  prior to randomisation and expected to stay stable throughout the study
                  treatment period are permitted so long as there is no clinical evidence or
                  suspicion of the immunosuppressant contributing to the subject's anaemia.

          2. Subject who has received prior to screening

               1. Within 8 weeks intramuscular or intravenous (IV) iron or administration of depot
                  iron preparation

               2. Within 2 weeks a blood transfusion

               3. Oral iron supplementation, taken specifically to treat anaemia, within the
                  previous 4 weeks (Over the Counter (OTC) multivitamins containing iron are
                  permitted)

          3. Subjects with active inflammatory bowel disease as defined by a SCCAI (Simple
             Clinical Colitis Activity Index) score greater than 5 at Screening or a CDAI (Crohn's
             Disease Activity Index) score greater than 300 in the Screening period (as assessed
             using the Screening haematocrit (HCT) and CDAI diary card completed by the subject
             for 7 days prior to planned randomization).

          4. Subject with known hypersensitivity or allergy to either the active substance or
             excipients of ferric maltol capsules or ferric carboxymaltose solution for IV
             administration.

          5. Subjects who have had serious adverse reactions to previous doses of ferric carboxy
             maltose (FCM).

          6. Subjects with contraindication for treatment with iron preparations, e.g.
             hemochromatosis, chronic hemolytic disease, sideroblastic anaemia, thalassemia, or
             lead intoxication induced anaemia.

          7. Subjects with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency as determined by the central
             laboratory screening results and the clinical opinion of the investigator. Subjects
             may start vitamin B12 or folate replacement and rescreen after at least 2 weeks.

          8. Subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding.

          9. Concomitant medical conditions with significant active bleeding likely to initiate or
             prolong anaemia.

         10. Participation in any other interventional clinical study within 30 days prior to
             screening.

         11. Subject with cardiovascular, liver, renal, haematologic, gastrointestinal,
             immunologic, endocrine, metabolic, or central nervous system disease that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may adversely affect the safety of the subject or
             severely limit the lifespan of the subject (i.e. unlikely to complete the full
             duration of the study).

         12. Subject with significant neurologic or psychiatric symptoms resulting in
             disorientation, memory impairment, or inability to report accurately that might
             interfere with treatment compliance, study conduct or interpretation of the results
             (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or other psychosis, active or current
             alcohol or drug abuse).

         13. Subject who is an inmate of a psychiatric ward, prison, or other state institution.

         14. Subject who is an Investigator or any other team member involved directly or
             indirectly in the conduct of the clinical study.

         15. Subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min). (US only)
