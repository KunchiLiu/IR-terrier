      Objectives:

      Primary:

      â€¢ To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of CMP-001 when given in combination with
      Pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced melanoma.

      Methodology:

      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b clinical study of intratumoral administration of
      CMP-001 in combination with Pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced melanoma. The study will
      be conducted in two phases: 1) a Dose Escalation Phase and 2) a Dose Expansion Phase.

      The Dose Escalation Phase of the study will utilize a &quot;3+3&quot; design for escalation. The study
      plan includes the evaluation of up to 4 dose levels of CMP-001 administered intratumorally
      (1 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg) and 2 dosing schedules (Schedule A [weekly dosing] and Schedule
      B [Q3 week dosing]). A minimum of 3 and a maximum of 12 subjects will be enrolled in each
      dose escalation cohort. If the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) rate is &lt;33% in a cohort,
      escalation to the next dose-escalation cohort may proceed.

      The Dose Expansion Phase will include a maximum of two CMP-001 dose levels and two dosing
      schedules (i.e., maximum of 4 cohorts); with the maximum dose level no higher than the MTD
      from the Dose Escalation Phase. Dose expansion may occur at any dose level after all
      subjects dosed at the same level in the dose escalation portion of the protocol have
      completed the DLT assessment period, and the dose level has been deemed safe and has not
      exceeded the acceptable DLT rate. Accrual into a dose expansion cohort may not exceed 24
      subjects per cohort. The key objectives of the Dose Expansion Phase are to further
      characterize the safety, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of
      CMP-001 when administered in combination with Pembrolizumab at selected dose/schedule
      combinations.

    <description>The study is designed to be conducted in two phases:1) a Dose Escalation Phase 2) a Dose Expansion Phase.
The study will evaluate two schedules of CMP-001 given intratumorally (and in combination with Pembrolizumab), designated as Schedule &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;.
Schedule A: CMP-001 will be administered once a week for 7 weeks (i.e. Prime Phase; total of 7 doses). Thereafter it will be administered once every 6 weeks (i.e. Boost Phase) until the subject is discontinued.
Schedule B: CMP-001 will be administered once a week for 2 weeks, then once every 3 weeks for 5 additional doses (i.e., Prime Phase; total of 7 doses). Thereafter it will be administered once every 6 weeks (i.e. Boost Phase) until the subject is discontinued.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of cutaneous, metastatic malignant melanoma
             arising from skin. Ocular melanoma subjects are not eligible.

          3. Currently receiving treatment with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab either alone
             or in combination. Subjects must have either Stable Disease (SD) or Progressive
             Disease (PD) per RECIST Version 1.1 while on pembrolizumab.

               -  Subjects who have had SD must have been on pembrolizumab for at least 12 weeks.

               -  There is no minimum treatment duration for subjects who have PD while on
                  pembrolizumab, OR

               -  Subjects who have previously received any other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, alone
                  or in combination, and who were deemed to have not responded to this
                  therapy/combination irrespective of the timing of the prior therapy relative to
                  first dose of CMP-001.

          4. Subjects must have at least one tumor lesion with a longest diameter of â‰¥0.5 cm that
             can be easily palpated or detected by ultrasound to facilitate intratumoral injection
             of CMP-001 (i.e., tumor in skin, muscle, subcutaneous tissue or accessible lymph
             node).

          5. Subjects must have measurable disease by RECIST Version 1.1.

          6. Capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements.

          7. A life expectancy of greater than 24 weeks at Screening.

          8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.

          9. Most recent laboratory values (within 2 weeks prior to Week 1 Day 1 (W1D1)) before
             study entry meet the following standards:

               -  Bone marrow function: neutrophil count â‰¥1,000/mm3, platelet count â‰¥ 75,000/mm3
                  and hemoglobin concentration &gt; 8.0 g/dL.

               -  Liver function: total bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
                  ranges of each institution, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
                  aminotransferase (ALT) â‰¤ 3 times the ULN range of each institution.

               -  Renal function: serum creatinine â‰¤ 1.5 times the ULN range of each institution.

         10. The subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative must sign a written
             informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study procedures.

             Dose Expansion Phase subjects must also meet the following inclusion criterion:

         11. At least one additional lesion that is measurable and is not intended for injection
             (to allow an assessment of systemic antitumor effect). These lesions not intended for
             injection may be located in any metastatic site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or breast feeding.

          2. Received investigational therapy with another drug or biologic within 30 days prior
             to the start of CMP-001 dosing on W1D1. However, if an investigational drug has a
             short half-life, a shorter wash out period may be acceptable upon permission given by
             the Sponsor.

          3. Received treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody within 30 days prior to the start of
             CMP-001 dosing on W1D1.

          4. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or
             HCV.

          5. Developed autoimmune disorders of Grade 4 while on prior immunotherapy. Subjects who
             developed autoimmune disorders of Grade â‰¤ 3 may enroll if the disorder has resolved
             to Grade â‰¤ 1 and the subject has been off systemic steroids for at least 2 weeks.
             Subjects who experienced autoimmune colitis as a toxicity of prior immunotherapy must
             undergo screening colonoscopy to rule out ongoing inflammation or have documentation
             that colitis has resolved (e.g. prior colonoscopy).

          6. Require systemic pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids at or above the equivalent of
             10 mg/d prednisone; replacement doses, topical, ophthalmologic and inhalational
             steroids are permitted. Subjects who are currently receiving steroids at a dose of &lt;
             10 mg/d do not need to discontinue steroids prior to enrollment.

          7. Active (i.e., symptomatic or growing) central nervous system (CNS) metastases.
             Subjects with CNS metastases are eligible for the trial if the metastases have been
             treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy, the subject is off corticosteroids and is
             neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening.

          8. Any concurrent uncontrolled illness, including mental illness or substance abuse,
             which in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unable to cooperate
             and participate in the trial.

          9. Severe uncontrolled cardiac disease within 6 months of Screening, including but not
             limited to uncontrolled hypertension; unstable angina; myocardial infarction (MI) or
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

         10. Requires prohibited treatment (i.e., non-protocol specified anticancer
             pharmacotherapy, surgery or conventional radiotherapy for treatment of malignant
             tumor).

         11. Women of child-bearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use an acceptable
             method of contraception.
