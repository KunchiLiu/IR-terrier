    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b dose-finding study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
      and preliminary antitumor activity of avelumab (MSB00100718C) in adult patients with
      relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma (cHL). Patients enrolled in this study
      are required to have failed a prior course of high dose chemotherapy as a part of a
      first-line salvage chemotherapy regimen for cHL. The primary purpose of this study is to
      assess the pharmacokinetics, biological activity and early signs of efficacy of various
      avelumab dosing regimens in patients with cHL.

             refractory disease

          -  At least 1 FDG-PET-avid (Deauville 4/5) measurable lesion &gt;1.5 cm as defined by

          -  A pre-treatment tumor biopsy (lymph node or bone marrow) is mandatory at baseline for
             the expansion phase. A pre-treatment tumor biopsy in the lead in phase and an
             on-treatment biopsy in both phases are optional.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients in dose expansion cohorts
             only

          -  Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. May be enrolled if patient had stopped
             prior anti-PD1 therapy more than one year ago and had responded.

          -  Systemic anti-cancer therapy less than 2 weeks of study entry

          -  Prior palliative radiotherapy to lesion(s) permitted as long as there is at least one
             target lesion evaluable for anti-tumor activity
