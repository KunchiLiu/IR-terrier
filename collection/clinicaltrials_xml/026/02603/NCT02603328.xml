    <textblock>
      The study aims to demonstrate that extended course atorvastatin therapy reduces lesional
      iron deposition without increasing the risk of rebleeding (acute hemorrhage) in patients
      with cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM). Subjects will be randomized to daily
      atorvastatin (20,40 or 80mg PO) or placebo and followed for 36 months, or until a clinically
      overt CCM hemorrhage or attrition from drug related adverse events. Subjects will undergo a
      total of four MRI scans with biomarker studies, and serial clinical assessments.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study is a prospective phase I/II randomized, placebo-controlled,
      single-blinded, single-site clinical trial. Sixty CCM subjects will be randomized in a 2:1
      fashion to receive either atorvastatin (40 mg PO) or placebo, All subjects will undergo
      baseline and three interval MRI studies at 6, 18 and 36 months throughout the three-year
      study period. Systematic dose escalation regime will be followed based on lesional and brain
      vascular permeability assessed by dynamic contrast enhanced quantitative perfusion (DCEQP).
      At the six month MRI scan, subjects with &gt; 30% reduction in either lesional or brain
      permeability will be continued on the same dose. If neither lesional or background brain
      permeability exhibit &gt;30% reduction, the dose will be escalated to 80 mg in the absence of
      any side effects. Enrolled subjects and investigators assessing dose related DCEQP and iron
      deposition in lesions by Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) will be blinded to
      treatment group allocation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of CCM of any genotype supported by relevant imaging studies.

          2. Symptomatic CCM bleeding event within 2 years prior to enrollment.

          3. Must be willing/able to travel to the study site for all study visits (baseline, 6
             months, 18 months and 36 months) over the course of the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-menopausal women who are breastfeeding, pregnant or likely to get pregnant during
             the study period.

          2. Previous cranial irradiation.

          3. Failure to pass MRI safety screening (claustrophobia, metal implant . . . etc)

          4. Known allergy or intolerance to gadolinium.

          5. Severely impaired renal function (eGFR &lt; 60ml/min), active renal disease or status
             post-kidney transplants.

          6. Statin therapy, for any indication, within 12 months preceding enrollment.

          7. Indication to use statin medication for current approved indication, unrelated to CCM

          8. Known allergy or intolerance to statins

          9. Liver dysfunction or active liver disease (including chronic viral hepatitis) defined
             as baseline serum transaminases levels twice the upper range of normal.

         10. Previous diagnosis of skeletal muscle disorders of any cause (myopathy), or baseline
             creatine kinase level five times the upper range of normal.

         11. Currently treated with or likely to need treatment with one or more of prohibited
             medications listed in section 5.3.

         12. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

         13. Serious illness (requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization) until subject
             either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the
             site investigator, for at least 30 days prior to study entry.

         14. Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated, including conditions
             resulting in or precipitating myopathy (e.g. HIV, uncontrolled hypothyroidism).

         15. In the investigator's opinion, the patient is unstable, and would benefit from a
             specific intervention rather than treatment with atorvastatin.

         16. Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to give
             written informed consent.

         17. No documentation of valid healthcare insurance.

         18. No medical record confirmation of primary care physician.
