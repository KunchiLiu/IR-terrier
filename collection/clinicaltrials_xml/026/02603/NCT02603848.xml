  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morphine is now the most commonly used opioid in children for pain management even though
      the safety of morphine use in children is a primary concern for parents as it is perceived
      to have more associated risks. Ibuprofen and other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
      (NSAIDs) have also been shown to be effective for the management of postoperative pain with
      fewer associated adverse effects. However, there have been concerns that utilization of
      ibuprofen alone may lead to inadequate pain management. Evidence of whether ibuprofen is
      equally effective as morphine for postoperative pain control in pediatric inguinal surgery
      is lacking and needs to be further explored as a measure to potentially reduce opioid
      exposure in children. To determine which drug is more effective for relieving post-operative
      pain, this trial will compare the effectiveness of ibuprofen and morphine at reducing
      post-operative pain, and the amount of analgesic use required post-surgery.
