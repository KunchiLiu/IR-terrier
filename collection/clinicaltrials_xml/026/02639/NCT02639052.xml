      The purpose of this study is to determine if Botox is effective in the treatment of an
      experimentally induced itch that mimics chronic itch in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) has an antipruritic effect
      due to the inhibition of acetylcholine and other pruritic factors, such as substance P and
      glutamate. For instance, subcutaneous BoNT/A improves itch accompanied to hand eczema,
      dermatitis, lichen simplex, and rhinitis. Furthermore, a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study showed that BoNT/A reduced histamine itch intensity in healthy men. Since
      acetylcholine has been shown to mediate itch in atopic dermatitis, this study aims to test
      the itch relieving effect of BoNT/A on a non-histaminergic model for chronic itch. This
      non-histaminergic model using the plant cowhage induces itch by activating protease
      activated receptor 2 (PAR2) receptors, which play a role in the itch of atopic dermatitis,
      also making this model better suited to test the efficacy of BoNT/A to relive chronic itch.
