  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate patient related factors that contribute to
      increased risk of recurrent fractures, to investigate patient adherence to prescribed
      anti-osteoporotic drugs and cost-utility analysis.

      A standardized treatment program of osteoporosis will be introduced successively at 7
      hospitals in Norway from April 2015 to January 2016. This Project is named NoFRACT
      (Norwegian Capture the Fracture Initiative https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02536898).
      Patients above 50 years of age, who recently have suffered a low energy fracture, will be
      offered examination of osteoporosis and treatment if indicated. Some of these patients will
      be asked to participate in this consent-based sub-study (NoFRACTsub). At baseline, the
      patients will be asked to answer a questionnaire, collect blood-sample for measuring bone
      turnover markers (BTM) and outline possible causes for osteoporosis, in addition to Dual
      X-Ray Apsopiometry (DXA) scan including bone mineral density(BMD), trabecular bone
      score(TBS) and vertebral fracture assessment (VFA). At 1-year follow-up there will be a
      brief questionnaire and measuring of BTM. At 2-year follow-up there will be a brief
      questionnaire in addition to repeated measurement of DXA including BMD, TBS and VFA. All
      data will be stored securly at the designated server at the University of Oslo, Service of
      sensitive data, TSD. Data from questionnaires, hospital records and registers will be merged
      for cost-utility-analysis by health economics.
