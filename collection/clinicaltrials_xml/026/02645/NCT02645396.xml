      This study will be conducted at several Maternal and Child Health Hospitals (MCHHs) in China
      and the research activities will be integrated with routine medical services during
      pregnancy at the study sites.The investigators will build pragmatically a cohort of ~8000
      pregnant women aged 18 and above till the investigators successfully enroll 5000 live
      newborns at MCHHs and collect babies' saliva and urine samples.As a first step, The
      investigators will work with these hospitals to obtain the remaining blood/urine samples
      from ~8000 pregnant women at participants first visit to hospitals (for first trimester
      pregnancy services), and follow up participants till they deliver their babies and donate
      babies' urine and saliva samples. The arm of this study is to enroll 5000 pairs of newborns
      and their mothers. Only these newborns' mothers will remain in the final cohort and
      retrospectively their samples collected during pregnancy will be tested for data analysis.
      Other women whose newborns cannot be captured will be considered loss to follow-up and their
      samples will not be tested.

        This study will enroll ~8000 pregnant women aged 18 years and above at MCHHs. Pregnant
        women who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. All inclusion and
        exclusion criteria will be reviewed by investigators or qualified designees to ensure that
        each subject is qualified for the study. In general, those whose newborns (including early
        birth, any congenital anomaly) are successfully followed up remain in the study
        population. However, those with adverse pregnancy outcomes captured in the MCHHs, such as
        abortion and still birth, etc., will also be the investigators' subjects even though we
        cannot have newborns' urine/saliva samples.
