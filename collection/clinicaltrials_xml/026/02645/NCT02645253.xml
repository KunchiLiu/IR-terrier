  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential-group study to assess the
      safety and tolerability as well as how the drug (AZD7594) affects the body (pharmacodynamics
      [PD]) and how the body affects the drug (pharmacokinetics [PK]) when AZD7594 is given as
      single and multiple ascending doses once daily by inhalation to healthy male Japanese
      subjects, compared with placebo (non-active drug)

      This is a phase I, randomized, single-blind, placebo controlled, sequential-group design
      study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      AZD7594 after single and multiple ascending doses given once daily by inhalation in healthy
      male Japanese subjects, compared with placebo

             Note: If a subject declines to participate in the genetic component of the study,
             there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the subject. The subject will not be
             excluded from other aspects of the study described in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease, or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion

          3. Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of investigational drug administration.

         12. Any clinically significant abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the
             resting ECG and any clinically significant abnormalities in the 12-lead ECG, as
             considered by the investigator that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc
             interval changes, including abnormal ST-T-wave morphology, particularly in the
             protocol defined primary lead or left ventricular hypertrophy.

         13. Prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate (HR) using Fridericia's formula (QTcF)
             &gt; 450 ms or family history of long QT syndrome.

             for example, ventricular hypertrophy or pre-excitation.

         17. Known or suspected history of drug abuse, as judged by the investigator.

         18. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the
             previous 3 months.

             to the unit.

         21. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically significant
             allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the investigator or history of

             (other than paracetamol/acetaminophen), herbal remedies, megadose vitamins (intake of
             20 to 600 times the recommended daily dose) and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to
             the first administration of investigational drug or longer if the medication has a
             long half-life.

         25. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been

             is longer) of the first administration of investigational drug in this study. The
             period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or 1 month after the last
             visit whichever is the longest.

             Note: Subjects consented and screened, but not randomized in this study or a previous
             phase I study, are not excluded.

         26. Vulnerable subjects, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship,
             trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.

         28. Involvement of any Astra Zeneca or study site employee or their close relatives.

         29. Judgment by the investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
             unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.

         30. Subjects who are vegans or have medical dietary restrictions.

         31. Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator. It is acceptable to
