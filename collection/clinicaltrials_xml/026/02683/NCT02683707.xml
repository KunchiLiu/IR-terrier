  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With potent analgesic properties, perceived hemodynamic benefits and limited alternatives,
      opiates are the analgesic mainstay for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients reporting
      peri-procedural pain or nitrate-resistant chest pain. However, large observational studies
      suggest that opiate administration during ACS may result in adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
      Complimenting this, a number of recent mechanistic studies have demonstrated delayed and
      attenuated effects of oral dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) on platelet inhibition
      endpoints among subjects receiving intravenous morphine. These studies support the
      hypothesis that morphine delays the gastrointestinal absorption of DAPT medications.
      However, no data exist on the impact of intravenous fentanyl, a systemic opioid analgesic
      routinely administered during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures, on the
      platelet inhibition effects of DAPT. The investigators hypothesize that, similar to
      morphine, fentanyl administered at the time of PCI will reduce and delay the effect of DAPT
      on platelet function. As such, the primary aim of this study is to test the impact of
      intravenous fentanyl on residual platelet reactivity by randomizing patients undergoing PCI
      to a strategy of peri-procedural benzodiazepine plus non-systemic local analgesia or to the
      current standard of benzodiazepine plus intravenous fentanyl. Given the critical need for
      rapid and robust inhibition of platelet function during PCI, this trial has true potential
      to change clinical practice, particularly if the investigators demonstrate reduced DAPT
      absorption and elevated residual platelet reactivity among patients receiving fentanyl
      during PCI.
