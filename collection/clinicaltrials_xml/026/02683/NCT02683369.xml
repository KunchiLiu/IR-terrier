  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy premenopausal women that are iron-deficient without anemia will receive a low-dose
      iron dietary supplement. The investigators seek to determine if the low-dose iron dietary
      supplement will restore iron levels to normal range with fewer side effects than typically
      experienced at higher doses of iron supplementation.

      The primary purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of a low-dose iron
      dietary supplement on markers of iron status among a sample of premenopausal women that are
      iron-deficient without anemia. This study will also assess the incidence of mild adverse
      events (constipation, nausea, etc.) that are relatively common with other over the counter
      iron dietary supplements and that the investigators hypothesize will be reduced with this
      lower-dose formulation.

    <description>The low-dose iron dietary supplement is a tablet that contains vitamins and minerals selected to help maintain healthy red blood cells and iron levels in the blood. The supplement ingredients aim to generate a supplement by taking a food which contains the naturally occurring, complex matrix of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and all other elements associated with the vitamin or mineral of interest. These natural food sources are used to generate tablets that maintain the vitamin and mineral potency found in the original food source as well as the associated elements that naturally accompany it.
One tablet will be taken once a day offering a total daily serving of:
15 mg of Vitamin C
400 mcg of Folate
30 mcg Vitamin of B-12
26 mg of Iron
125 mg of Beet Root</description>
