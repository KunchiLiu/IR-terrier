  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of GBR 830 on biomarkers in AD/ eczema
      to enable further studies in this indication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo baseline assessments
      and randomize to receive GBR 830 or placebo. Safety and tolerability of GBR 830 will be
      evaluated in patients with AD/eczema.
