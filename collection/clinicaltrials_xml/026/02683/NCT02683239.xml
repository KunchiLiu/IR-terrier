  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10,000 patients will participate in this study to further characterize the
      safety profile of fasinumab and provide data on long-term exposure to provide efficacy data.

      In addition to their participation in the main study, approximately 800 patients will
      participate in a sub-study to characterize the onset of pain relief by fasinumab.
