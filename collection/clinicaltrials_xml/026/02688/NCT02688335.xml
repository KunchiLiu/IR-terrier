  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study in which patients with a history of habitual snoring will
      use the low-pressure CPAP device at home for about 2 weeks. This study is designed to
      document the adherence of the snorer, the acceptance and comfort of the therapy, and bed
      partners' subjective report of improvement in sleep quality, and/or reduction or elimination
      of snoring. Study outcomes will consist of an assessment of the nightly usage time, and
      questionnaires that the snorer and the bed-partner have to complete before the start of the
      study, after two night's treatment, and at the end of the study period.

      This is an interventional study in which patients with a history of habitual snoring use the
      Cloud9™ Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) device that delivers a low level of
      continuous nasal air pressure between 2 cm H2O and 4 cm H2O, for about two weeks at their
      home. This study is designed to document the adherence of the snorer, the acceptance and
      comfort of the therapy, and bed partners' subjective report of improvement in sleep quality,
      and/or reduction or elimination of snoring.

      Study Procedures

      Baseline Assessment: The study begins with a baseline assessment to determine whether each
      participant meets the entry criteria for the study. After consent, participant snorers will
      have a history and physical exam to confirm entry criteria and answer a questionnaire
      (Hopkins Sleep Survey) to assess their sleepiness. In a second step, snoring participants
      who meet the entry criteria will receive a full night polysomnogram (PSG) to confirm snoring
      and to rule out sleep apnea or any other sleep related disorder. Participants who already
      performed a full night PSG as a part of the earlier sleep lab study for the Cloud9 device
      (Treatment of Snoring Trial) do not have to be re-screened, if the earlier PSG is not older
      than 24 months, and the participant's body mass index (BMI) remains within 3 kg/m2 of its
      original value.

      Run-In: The device will be given to participants who meet study entry criteria as assessed
      through History and Physical Exam (H&amp;P) and PSG. During this visit, the snoring and bed
      partner will be asked to complete questionnaires and will be introduced to the device.
      Snoring participants will be instructed to use the device as much as possible for 2 nights.
      Usage data will be recorded by the device and read when returned to the study site on the
      third day.

      Post Run-In Visit: During this visit, snoring participants and their partners will be
      administered questionnaires. Usage data from the device and the usage diary will be read for
      compliance (defined as 4 hours per night for 70% of time). A study team member will also
      take this time to discuss any issues or questions the participants may have.

      Home-Trial: Participants who are found to be sufficiently compliant at run-in will be asked
      to use the device at home for an additional 2 weeks. Snoring participants will receive a
      compliance call on the day after night 1 of the home trial. Additionally, snoring
      participants will receive a compliance call after week 1 to assess the user experience with
      the device.

      Final Visit: At the end of the 2 weeks, participants will return the device to the sleep
      lab. Usage data from the device and the usage diary will be read for compliance. Snoring
      participants and their bed partners will also complete a final set of questionnaires.

      For each participant, there will be one visit (in the sleep lab), to assess and quantify
      their snoring frequency and severity. Every participant meeting the initial entry criteria
      will have this baseline study. For those participants with evidence of obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) on the baseline study, the duration of the study will be one night only.

      Snoring intensity will be assessed on the first baseline night of the study. Participants
      will be required to demonstrate a snoring intensity that exceeds 45 decibels (dBA) for &gt; 5%
      or 40 dBA &gt; 10% of the sleep time on the baseline night of the study before proceeding with
      the home treatment nights. For those participants without significant snoring, the study
      duration will be one night only.

      For those participants who already performed and passed the initial study night (see
      Baseline Assessment above), the full PSG night is not required.

      The investigators anticipate that it will take approximately 12 months to enroll a maximum
      of 50 participants for the home test. The investigators may stop enrollment earlier if the
      investigators demonstrate sufficient power and effect at lower numbers.

             BMI ≤ 35, or subjects with a BMI &gt;35 who have no significant sleep apnea already
             documented on an overnight sleep study.

        Exclusion Criteria: (For subjects recruited from the previous inSleep protocol, the BMI
        must be in a range of ±3 kg/m2 of the earlier recorded value)
