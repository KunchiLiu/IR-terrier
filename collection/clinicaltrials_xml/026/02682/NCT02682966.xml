      This is a prospective study in patients who undergo routine postoperative troponin
      assessment after major elective noncardiac surgery. Two groups are created based on
      postoperative troponin levels: Postoperative myocardial injury (PMI) group with troponin I
      levels ≥ 60 ng/L and a control group with troponin levels &lt; 60ng/L. Our objective is to
      determine the association of PMI with CAD and PMI with pulmonary embolism using coronary
      computed tomography angiography in patients undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery.

        Patients of 60 years or older that undergo major elective noncardiac surgery are eligible
        for study participation. Major elective noncardiac surgery is defined as all surgical
        procedures requiring ≥ 24 hours of hospital admittance that have been preceded by a
        preoperative consultation at the anaesthesia preoperative screening outpatient clinic

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥ 60 years old

          -  Major noncardiac surgery, defined as non-cardiac surgical procedures requiring
             hospital admittance &gt; 24 hours

          -  Elective surgery, defined as surgery that that has been preceded by a preoperative
             consultation at the anaesthesia preoperative screening outpatient clinic.

          -  ≥ 1 troponin assessment in the first 3 postoperative days as a part of the routine
             'postoperative troponin assessment' protocol.

          -  For patients who undergo surgery more than once, the first surgery will be included
             in the analysis. Reoperations will not be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Typical anginal complaints

          -  Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or new left bundle branch block
             (LBBB) on ECG

          -  Patients unable to fully comply to study needs (e.g. incompetent patients or patients
             unable to communicate in Dutch or English)

          -  Contra-indications for CCTA: Severe claustrophobia; Allergic reaction to contrast
             fluid; Renal insufficiency, defined as a GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2, calculated with the
             Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) calculator; Left ventricular ejection
             fraction &lt;35%; uncontrolled irregular heart rhythm or tachycardia unresponsive to
             beta blockade (e.g. atrial fibrillation)
