      The purpose of this research is to develop and test a mobile application called RELAX, which
      is designed to help with stress management during weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and stress are highly comorbid and both increase risk for cardiovascular disease
      (CVD). Stress is associated with disinhibited eating, junk food consumption and low
      consumption of produce and whole grains. Both stress and stress-induced eating are not only
      associated with obesity but also predict worst outcomes in lifestyle interventions. Stress
      and stress-induced eating should be targeted in interventions to maximize weight loss;
      however, this makes for a very intensive intervention. Technology could be leveraged to
      reduce intervention burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop and test the
      feasibility and proof-of-concept of RELAX Application Suite (AS), a mobile-, cloud- and
      web-based companion to a lifestyle intervention that addresses stress. RELAX-AS will be
      designed to reduce clinical visit time by identifying for the clinician the patient's
      behavior and stress patterns that account for the greatest deviations in energy balance.
      Investigators have created an app for diet and exercise self-monitoring. The RELAX-AS will
      build upon previous work to create a comprehensive weight loss and stress reduction
      application suite.

      RELAX-AS will include RELAX-app and RELAX-web. RELAX-app is a patient-facing mobile
      application that will be linked to the Microsoft Health Vault, a cloud-based platform that
      allows for secure access of health data online. RELAX-app will include self-monitoring
      (diet, exercise, stress, stress-induced eating); automated feedback via easy-to-interpret
      visual displays and feedback reports on the amount, timing, context, and relationship
      between target behaviors; and self-guided stress management features that are prompted when
      stress ratings are elevated. To minimize burden, investigators will incorporate barcode
      scanners for diet recording, GPS for exercise tracking, visual analogue scales for stress
      ratings, and provide brief stress reduction strategies. RELAX-web is a web-based application
      for clinicians to access the patient's information in the form of easily digestible visual
      displays and feedback reports to increase the efficiency of their counseling. In traditional
      counseling much time is spent reviewing paper self-monitoring records and soliciting
      information from the patient about factors impacting their adherence (e.g., stress and
      stress eating). The purpose of RELAX-web is to reduce the clinic time needed to deliver
      care. The goal is to use RELAX-AS to create an intervention delivery model that reduces both
      weight and stress. The investigators propose a 3-year study to develop and test usability,
      feasibility, and acceptability. This work is in preparation for a 2-arm efficacy trial
      comparing RELAX-AS with a brief lifestyle intervention to a brief lifestyle intervention
      alone on weight, stress, and stress eating.

    <description>Participants will participate in a 6-month weight loss intervention which will include: fifteen 15-minute weight loss counseling visits lead by a weight loss clinician; handouts related to nutrition and exercise to read outside of the study visit; and use of the RELAX app developed by the study team. Participants will be instructed to use RELAX app daily for: diet and physical activity logging; monitoring stress level; receiving information to cope with stress; charts to see how they are doing over time; and receive feedback reports given to them and their PCP, which includes information about how they are doing toward their goals. We will also encourage participants to meet with their physician to discuss feedback reports. Weight loss clinicians and PCP will review participant's progress using the RELAX-web program.</description>
