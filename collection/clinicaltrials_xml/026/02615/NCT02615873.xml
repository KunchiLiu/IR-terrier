  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to allow evaluation of long-term clinical effect and safety
      outcome of treatment with AP-CD/LD, as well as to allow patients to benefit from extended
      treatment duration with AP-CD/LD after they have successfully completed the Phase 3 core
      study IN 11 004 ('core study', a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      double-dummy, active-controlled Phase 3 study to assess the safety and efficacy of AP CD/LD
      versus IR CD/LD in fluctuating PD patients).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, global, open-label study in adult suffering from fluctuating
      Parkinson's disease subjects who have successfully completed the core study IN 11 004.

      After signing informed consent and meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, eligible subjects
      will be enrolled into a 12-month open-label extension and receive the AP-CD/LD as needed.

      Efficacy and safety will be assessed throughout the study period.

             004 clinical trial is required)

          2. Anticipates functional neurosurgical treatment for PD (e.g., procedures including
