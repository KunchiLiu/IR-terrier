  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of the Erigo applied as part of the early mobilization
      program in the Trauma ICU at the University of Kentucky. It is our hypothesis, that with the
      Erigo, critically ill patients will tolerate verticalization and mobilization earlier and
      safely resulting in improved outcomes measured by increased mobility and strength on ICU
      discharge, decreased requirements for mechanical ventilation, reduced complication rates and
      decreased ICU and hospital LOS.

    <textblock>
      The &quot;Erigo&quot; by Hocoma is a combination of tilt table with a robotic stepper device allowing
      for cyclic leg loading. Erigo now also includes Functional Electrical Stimulation to
      optimize active neuromuscular stimulation. It allows for protected gradual verticalization
      and mobilization based on patient tolerance and progress. It has been shown to improve
      orthostatic tolerance, cerebral blood flow and muscle strength.

      Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial will compare two groups. The patients that meet
      inclusion criteria will be randomized into either the treatment group or a control group.
      General ICU mobility guidelines consist of scaled activity related to the patients'
      stability. The control group will get the general ICU mobility treatments and the treatment
      group will have one mobility treatment replaced with the Erigo treatment.
