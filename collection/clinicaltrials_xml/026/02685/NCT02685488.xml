  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Because a significant number of
      people with depression do not respond to medication or therapy, alternative treatment
      options are greatly needed. Recent research has focused on brain stimulation methods due to
      their therapeutic utility for treating depression. Yet, current brain stimulation methods
      have drawbacks, including invasive surgery and limited precision in targeting specific
      areas. A novel brain stimulation method, transcranial ultrasound (TUS), is noninvasive, has
      greater spatial precision than most existing methods, and is proven safe for humans. TUS has
      been found to increase positive mood in chronic pain patients. In a double blind study, TUS
      increased positive mood in over 140 healthy undergraduates at the University of Arizona.

      Despite evidence that TUS can increase positive mood in humans, it has yet to be
      investigated whether TUS can increase positive mood in humans who are experiencing chronic
      low mood or depression. The present study will, for the first time, examine whether TUS can
      improve depressive symptoms. Twenty to thirty participants with mild to moderate depressive
      symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory Score between 10 and 25) will be randomly assigned to a
      TUS sham or TUS activation condition. In the TUS activation condition, TUS will be used to
      stimulate the right fronto-temporal area, which has previously been shown to increase
      positive mood. Participants in the TUS sham condition will not receive any brain
      stimulation. Participants will attend five sessions within seven days or ten sessions within
      fourteen days. At each session, in addition to brain stimulation, self-reported mood and
      depressive symptoms will be recorded. Furthermore, the investigators will use
      electroencephalogram (EEG) to record changes in brain electrical signals during TUS
      stimulation. Based on prior research, the investigators predict that mood will increase and
      depressive symptoms will decrease with TUS stimulation.

      Participants will first complete the online screening and those who qualify to complete the
      study will be contacted via telephone (see above for telephone recruitment and consent
      procedure). After providing informed consent, on the first day, participants will be
      randomly assigned to either a TUS treatment or a TUS sham condition (placebo), and the study
      will be double blind. Participants in the TUS treatment condition (with sham or treatment
      unknown to both participant and experimenter) will have TUS stimulation at the right
      fronto-temporal area five times within seven days or ten times within fourteen days.

      Participants will sign up for the first five sessions first but will be reminded
      participants may withdraw from the study at any time. Should participants choose to continue
      with the second week of treatment, participants will be scheduled for another five sessions.
      In other words, participants will have the option of completing 10 days of the procedure.
      The procedure does not differ between week 1 and week 2. However, participants will be
      compensated less for week 2. Participants will have the option to continue into week 2, as
      participants may find that the treatment is benefiting them. The first, fifth, and tenth
      days of the study will take approximately 2 hours and the second, third, fourth, sixth,
      seventh, eighth, and ninth will take only one hour.

      In the sham condition, the ultrasound probe will be placed at the right fronto-temporal area
      five times over the course of seven days or ten times over the course of fourteen days
      without the stimulation. Prior research has shown that stimulation at this area induces
      positive mood change and is implicated in positive mood. On the first, middle, and last day
      of the procedure (day 1, 5, 10), EEG data will be collected. On the second, third, and
      fourth day as well as sixth through ninth days of the procedure EEG data will not be
      collected and only TUS stimulation will occur. Collecting EEG data at these points will
      allow for comparison of resting electrical brain profiles from the beginning of the study to
      the end of the study. Additionally, the investigators will assess state mood and rumination
      before and after TUS, as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms at the end of each day. The
      state mood and rumination will allow us to examine the mood effects of TUS, whereas the
      depressive and anxiety symptoms questionnaires will allow us to examine any changes in these
      important profiles over the course of the study.
