    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the Sentosa SA HSV1/2
      Qualitative PCR Test. Precision of results and concordance of results with a reference assay
      will be evaluated.

      This study will utilize residual samples from male and female patients with signs and
      symptoms of oral or genital HSV infections. Genital samples will include internal and
      external genital lesions such as those collected from lesions of the anus, buttocks, vagina,
      labia, or penis. Oral samples will include those collected from lip, gum, and mouth lesions.
      For concordance testing, the sample size is based on historical study design and estimates
      of the expected prevalence of HSV1 and/or HSV2 in the population enrolled.

    <description>Study will assess clinical sensitivity and specificity of Sentosa HSV 1/2 assay in detecting HSV DNA compared to traditional microbiology culture-based ELVIS method (reference assay). Clinical sensitivity and specificity for HSV DNA detection will be determined for each virus (HSV 1 and 2) at each type of anatomic site (genital lesion and oral lesion). Clinical sensitivity will be the ratio of test assay to reference assay positives. Clinical specificity will be the ratio of test assay negatives to reference assay negatives. Ratios will be presented with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sample was taken from a lesion from an internal or external oral or genital site.

          -  Sample was submitted to a clinical laboratory for the purpose of testing for the
