  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an often severe and frequently disabling condition.
      It is associated with compromised health, early mortality, and substantial economic costs.
      PTSD is common in VA primary care patients; however, brief, effective treatments for PTSD
      are not available in the primary care setting. Instead, patients with PTSD are referred to
      mental health settings, yet many patients do not accept these referrals or do not adequately
      engage in such services. Thus, this project seeks to improve health care for Veterans by
      testing the effectiveness of a primary care-based treatment called clinician-supported PTSD
      Coach. In this treatment a primary care mental health clinician guides patients in using the
      PTSD Coach mobile app to learn about PTSD symptoms, treatment options, and strategies to
      cope with common PTSD-related concerns. If this treatment is found to be effective at
      reducing PTSD symptoms and increasing use of mental health care, it will provide a
      tremendous benefit to Veterans with PTSD seen in VA primary care.

      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an often severe and frequently disabling condition.
      It is associated with compromised health, early mortality, and substantial economic costs.
      PTSD is common in VA primary care patients; however, brief, effective treatments for PTSD
      are not available in the primary care setting. Instead, patients with PTSD are referred to
      mental health settings, yet many patients do not accept these referrals or do not adequately
      engage in such services. Thus, this project represents a unique opportunity to improve
      health care for Veterans by examining the effectiveness of a primary care-based treatment
      called Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach. In this treatment a primary care mental health
      clinician guides patients in using the PTSD Coach mobile app to learn about PTSD symptoms,
      treatment options, and strategies to cope with common PTSD-related concerns. This randomized
      clinical trial will enroll and treat 260 VA primary care patients (female and male) who have
      PTSD and are not currently being treated for it. Commonly used, well-established clinical
      interviews and self-report measures will be used to assess important clinical outcomes. If
      this direct treatment is found to be effective at reducing PTSD symptoms and increasing use
      of mental health care, it will provide a tremendous benefit to Veterans with PTSD seen in VA
      primary care.
