      This study will be a proof of concept, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial in
      participants with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to evaluate the efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, disease progression measures by IVUS, and
      pharmacodynamics of MDCO-216 infusion. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive 5
      infusions of MDCO-216 20 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have experienced a recent ACS event within 14 days of screening that requires a
             clinically indicated coronary angiogram.

          -  A qualifying ACS event will be defined as follows: a diagnosis of a qualifying
             myocardial infarction (MI) event will be defined by abnormal levels of cardiac
             biomarkers (troponin I or T or creatine kinase myoglobin [CK-MB] mass) with at least
             one determination greater than the 99th percentile or upper limits of normal (ULN)
             for the laboratory and at least one of the following: chest discomfort or symptoms of
             myocardial ischemia (≥10 minutes) at rest within 24 hours prior to hospitalization
             for MI and/or new electrocardiogram (ECG) findings (or presumed new if no prior ECG
             available) indicative of acute myocardial ischemia in absence of left ventricular
             hypertrophy and left bundle branch block (LBB).

          -  Baseline coronary angiogram must meet all of the following criteria for IVUS
             interrogation of target artery:

               -  Target artery must be accessible to the IVUS catheter

               -  Target artery must have a stenotic area of ≥20% and &lt;50% in lumen diameter by
                  angiographic visual estimation within the length of the native coronary artery
                  (&quot;target segment&quot;) for imaging by IVUS

               -  Target artery has not undergone prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
                  or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)

               -  Target artery is not currently a candidate for intervention or a likely
                  candidate for intervention over the treatment phase of the study and until the
                  second IVUS interrogation at Day 36; the target artery may not be a bypass graft

               -  Target artery may not be the culprit vessel for a previous MI.

          -  The target artery may have the following:

               -  A lesion of up to 60% stenosis, distal to the target segment, provided that this
                  area is not a target for PCI or CABG

               -  A single branch of the &quot;target vessel&quot; may have a narrowing ≤ 70% by visual
                  estimation, provided that the branch in question is not a target for PCI or
                  CABG.

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent before initiation of any study-related
             procedures and willing to comply with all required study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Baseline IVUS not completed due to non-qualifying coronary angiogram as demonstrated
             by: a greater than 50% reduction in lumen of the left main coronary artery by visual
             estimation, or extensive CAD with no target vessel for IVUS interrogation.

          -  Baseline IVUS interrogation determined to be unacceptable by the Atherosclerosis
             Imaging Core Laboratory.

          -  ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within the last 90 days

          -  Clinically significant heart disease which, in the opinion of the Investigator, is
             likely to require CABG, PCI cardiac transplantation, surgical or percutaneous valve
             repair, and/or replacement following index IVUS imaging (does not apply to PCI that
             occurs as a result of initial screening angiogram and completed prior to index IVUS
             imaging).

          -  New York Heart Failure Association Class III or IV heart failure or last known left
             ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%.

          -  Coronary artery bypass surgery &lt;6 weeks prior to the qualifying IVUS.

          -  Cardiac arrhythmia within 3 months prior to randomization that is not controlled by
             medication.

          -  Uncontrolled severe hypertension: systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic
             blood pressure &gt;110 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) prior to randomization despite
             anti-hypertensive therapy.

          -  Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &gt;10.0% prior to
             randomization.

          -  Active liver disease defined as any known current infectious, neoplastic, or
             metabolic pathology of the liver or alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
             aminotransferase elevation &gt;2 x ULN or total bilirubin elevation &gt;1.5 x ULN at
             screening confirmed by a repeat measurement at least one week apart.

          -  Fasting triglyceride value &gt;400 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL).

          -  Impaired kidney function defined as calculated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60
             milliliters/minute by estimated glomerular filtration rate. In addition, participants
             with a 0.3 mg/dL or 25% increase in serum creatinine in the initial 3 to 5 days
             following angiography will be excluded from the study.

          -  Serious comorbid disease in which the life expectancy of the participant is shorter

             methods, approved contraceptive implant, long- term injectable contraception,
             intrauterine device or tubal litigation). Women who are &gt;2 years postmenopausal
             defined as ≥1 year since last menstrual period and are &gt;55 years old with a negative
             pregnancy test within 24 hours of randomization or surgically sterile are exempt from
             this exclusion.

          -  Males who are unwilling to use an acceptable method of birth control during the
             entire study period (such as, condom with spermicide).

             product (dimeric recombinant ApoA-IM,

             phosphate buffer).

          -  Treatment with other investigational medicinal products or devices within 30 days or
             5half˗lives, whichever is longer.

          -  Known history of alcohol and/or drug abuse.

          -  Use of other investigational medicinal products or devices during the course of the
