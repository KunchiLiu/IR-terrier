  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and feasibility of using
      haploidentical or one antigen mismatch unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
      for adult patients with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) who undergo a non-myeloablative
      preparative regimen consisting of total body irradiation (TBI), cyclophosphamide and
      alemtuzumab and graft vs. host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisting of post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and sirolimus. The investigators
      anticipate that this approach will expand the donor pool and offer a safe and less toxic
      curative intervention.

If primary engraftment failure for the first 2 patients, subsequent patients will receive fludarabine from Day -7 to Day -3. If 2 additional subjects experience graft failure, the radiation dose will be increased to a total of 4 Gy in 2 Gy fractions given on Days -2 and -1
On Day 0 the allograft will be infused per standard practice.
GVHD prophylaxis will be administered as follows: post-transplant cyclophosphamide will be given on Days +3 and +4 at a dose of 50mg/kg
MMF will start on Day +5 and will continue through Day +35.
Sirolimus will be given orally at 4 mg on Day +5, followed by 1 mg daily, targeting a trough level of 10 to 15 ng/mL for the first 3 to 4 months, near 10 ng/mL for the remainder of the first year, and 5 to 10 ng/mL from the second year thereafter, to be tapered at one year only if donor T-cell chimerism reach more than 50% in the absence of GVH</description>
