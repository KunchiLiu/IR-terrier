    <textblock>
      The study is two-parted. First part's aim is to map need of pain medication among patients
      undergoing medical abortion in early pregnancy (under 9 pregnancy weeks). In second part
      investigators compare different administration routes of opiates in patients in medical
      abortion with pregnancy weeks 12-20. In both parts plan is to compare teenaged to adult
      women and in addition to try to map predicting factors of severe pain.

    <textblock>
      Adequate pain control is crucial in medical abortion. Experience of painful and traumatic
      abortion can affect patients future plans for pregnancy and childbirth. Study's purpose is
      to investigate only pain experience and management. Otherwise the treatment of abortion is
      according to present national guideline of Finland.

      Study's goal is to map predicting factors of severe pain and to evaluate the adequacy of our
      future pain medication. Investigators assume that while using more effective pain management
      via PCA pain sensation can be lowered. Assumably above all teen-aged patients benefit more
      than their adult controls from pain management via PCA.

      Study is done in cooperation with Helsinki university and Helsinki university central
      hospital and is accomplished in Womens hospital and Kätilöopisto hospital in which care of
      abortions is centralized in HUS area. This study is two-part.

      The need and sufficiency of pain medication and pain experience is compared among teen-aged
      and adult women undergoing medical abortion in early pregnancy. Still present pain
      management and pain management via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is compared in
      prospective randomized clinical trial when the length of pregnancy is more than 9 weeks. In
      both parts of the study are requested patients who choose medical abortion, are first time
      pregnant and aged between 15 and 19 years or 25 and 35 years. Patients volunteer in the
      study.

      First part is prospective study in which pain experience and sufficiency on pain medication
      is compared in three different age groups among women undergoing medical abortion in early
      pregnancy (under 9 weeks of pregnancy).

      Second part is intervention study. In controlled randomized study the analgesia via PCA is
      compared to pain management via oral or intramuscular administration of opiates in patients
      in medical termination of pregnancy with gestational age over 9 weeks. Patients are divided
      on two groups according to gestational age and we compare teen-aged and adult women together
      in both groups.

      Patient recruitment for the study is expected to start in the beginning of the year 2016 and
      lasts for 1,5-2 years time.

      With the help of our trial investigators hope to recognize those patients who benefit from
      more intense pain management and to create guideline on pain management so that all patients
      receive adequate analgesics in future.
