    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-cluster of differentiation
      (CD)47 monoclonal antibody Hu5F9-G4 in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that
      has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or has not responded to previous
      treatment (refractory). Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody
      Hu5F9-G4, block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.
