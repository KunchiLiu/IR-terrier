      The purpose of this research is to obtain ovarian tissue from female participants who will
      receive therapy which is expected to result in a loss or impairment of ovarian function
      and/or infertility and wish to preserve (freeze) ovarian tissue for the purpose of
      initiating a pregnancy in the future.

      Removal of the ovary for cryopreservation is an investigational procedure. 80% of the tissue
      will be used for the participant's future use and 20% will be sent to the Oncofertility
      Consortium at Northwestern University for research purposes. There have been 26 pregnancies
      as a result of frozen ovarian tissue that has been re-implanted back into the pelvis and
      hormonal function has been restored in individuals for up to 7 years

      By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn of how to successfully freeze and thaw
      ovarian tissue in a manner that permits subsequent use by patients at some point in the
      future. Participation may also advance our knowledge of how to successfully mature follicles
      and oocytes (eggs) that are contained in these tissues which may help others in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research procedures will be conducted at the University of Kentucky (UK) Medical Center
      and/or Norton Healthcare Facility such as Norton Hospital, Kosair's Children's Hospital and
      Norton Cancer Institute.

      Participants in the study will provide ovarian tissue cryopreservation for their own
      personal use and provide a research pool of ovarian tissue to establish technologies that
      will enable long-term preservation of ovarian function.

      The study will be conducted in collaboration with the NIH funded Oncofertility Consortium at
      Northwestern University. The duration of the study will be until the participant reaches age
      41 years. Participants will be broken out into four categories:

      Participants in Categories 1-3 will have surgical removal of their ovarian tissue using the
      methods determined by their surgeon based on their medical/surgical diagnosis or treatment.

      Participants undergoing elective removal of an ovary (Category 4 above) will undergo a
      procedure called laparoscopy to remove the ovary. This surgery will be performed under
      general anesthesia and one ovary will be removed in total through an instrument channel
      employing standard techniques of operative laparoscopy. This surgical procedure is performed
      solely for fertility preservation but will potentially be coordinated with another procedure
      such as placement of a central line for future chemotherapy or laparotomy for another
      purpose. Although only one ovary will be removed, both of the participant's ovaries must
      appear normal for the procedure to be completed. The ovary to be removed will be chosen at
      the time of surgery based on appearance and ease of removal. After the surgery is complete,
      the participant will not have any further procedures except for a routine post-operative
      visit. A 0.5 cm cross section from the short axis of the ovary will be provided to the
      Department of Pathology for routine histological evaluation, and the remaining tissue will
      be processed for cryopreservation. If pathology finds evidence of cancer in the ovarian
      tissue provided at surgery, they may request that all of the participant's tissue (even
      tissue that has been frozen for their use) be returned to pathology for a more detailed
      examination. In this case, no tissue is available for the participant to use for fertility
      preservation purposes

      Tissue collected for the national research repository at the Oncofertility Consortium is not
      intended for direct use by the participant, but to advance the science behind ovarian tissue
      cryopreservation and transplantation. Participants who elect not to take part in this
      portion of the study may still participate in the study to store ovarian tissue for their
      future use. The tissue obtained for research may therefore be used to:

        -  Optimize techniques for freezing and thawing of ovarian tissue for use in transplant or
           in vitro follicle maturation (IFM)

        -  Investigate factors affecting successful maturation of immature follicles obtained from
           ovarian tissue including the use of 3-dimensional bio-gel scaffolds, growth factors,
           hormones, and other culture conditions

        -  Determine the efficacy of ovarian tissue cryopreservation techniques

        -  Provide long term follow-up on participants who have ovarian tissue frozen for their
           own use

           b. Cryopreservation: Ovarian tissue will be cryopreserved under the National Physicians
           Cooperative of the Oncofertility Consortium. The ovarian tissue will be removed at a UK
           or Norton Healthcare facility and evaluated for gross disease by a pathologist,
           embryologist, andrologist or a reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI)
           physician. The ovarian cortex will be dissected from the medulla and cut into strips in
           culture/holding media, washed to remove blood cells, and cryopreserved.
           Cryopreservation will be performed using modifications of the techniques described by
           Gosden et al. (1994) or will be vitrified using a modification of the techniques of
           Kuwayama et al., 2007. The procedure for cryopreservation/vitrification may be modified
           as improvements become available.

      The designated laboratory directors at UK and Norton Healthcare, and Northwestern University
      are responsible for the overall quality of the ovarian tissue cryopreservation.

      c. Tissue storage: Cryopreserved participant tissues will be transferred to Reprotech, Ltd
      (RTL) in Roseville, Minnesota for storage and subsequent release. Reprotech, Ltd. is an FDA
      compliant and American Association of Tissue Banks accredited long term storage facility for
      reproductive tissues. Based on the extended periods of time that these tissues are likely to
      be stored Reprotech, Ltd. provides maximum flexibility for the participants involved. In
      this way, the participant can store tissues as long as they wish and ship them to a
      fertility treatment center of their choice at the time of use. The participant can determine
      how her own tissue will be used as technology changes and based on her unique circumstances.
      Reprotech, Ltd. does not perform fertility treatments and is not affiliated with any
      fertility center so there is no potential conflict of interest.

      Tissues designated for research will be provided to a research laboratory at Northwestern
      University via the National Physicians Cooperative of the Oncofertility Consortium either
      fresh or frozen.

      All research tissues will be de-identified; participants will be identified by number, not
      name. No information by which the participant can be identified will be released or
      published in connection with this study. Only the investigator and co-investigators will
      have access to files matching the participant with tissue specimen numbers. All data will be
      stored in a confidential database including the Cancer Central Clinical Database (C3D)
      provided by NIH National Cancer Institute for the Oncofertility Consortium. Data at the
      study locations will be permanently stored by the investigator and co-investigators.

      d. Infectious Disease Screening and Testing: Banking and subsequent use of ovarian tissue is
      regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In order to comply with current tissue
      banking regulations and to be prepared for any future changes in regulations while these
      ovarian tissues are in storage, participants will be tested and screened for a number of
      infectious diseases prior to banking ovarian tissue.The testing will include but not be
      limited to testing for Hepatitis B and C and HIV. The testing that will be performed will be
      testing that is mandated for donors of leukocyte rich tissues and must be performed within 7
      days of tissue procurement. In this way, the tissue could potentially be used by the
      participant herself and it could also be suitable for use in another individual (such as a
      surrogate) in the future if indicated by the participant's medical diagnosis.

      If the ovarian tissue was vaginally removed during surgery the sites will also collect a
      vaginal swab from the participant for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia testing.

      Please note that if the HIV screening test is positive, a confirmatory test will then be
      performed. Should the screening tests detect that participants are infected with HIV this
      information will be communicated confidentially to them through personal contact by a
      qualified professional. Participants will meet with a qualified professional who will
      provide HIV counseling.

      There are risks associated with this study and those risks are outlined in the study
      informed consent document.

      Benefit vs. Risk: There is no guarantee that participants will get any benefit from taking
      part in this study, although 26 babies have been born from transplanted frozen ovarian
      tissue. A females participation may provide her with a means to restore her fertility and
      reproductive hormonal function in the future as observed in previous reports. A females
      participation may also advance the investigator's understanding of how to successfully
      freeze and thaw ovarian tissue in a manner that permits subsequent use by the participant
      and other patients at some point in the future. A females participation may also advance the
      investigator's knowledge of how to successfully mature follicles and oocytes (eggs) that are
      contained in these tissues which may help the participant or others in the future. However,
      there is a significant possibility that there may be no direct benefit to the participant
      from her participation in this research study. Specifically, there is the possibility that
      ovarian cryopreservation will not result in successful pregnancy in the future.

      There are alternatives to taking part in this study and those alternatives are addressed in
      the study informed consent document.

      Costs: All expenses related to the research procedure will be covered by the research funds
      and include the oophorectomy, anesthesia, pathologist's fees and infectious disease testing.
      If the participant elects to contribute tissue to the research pool at time of consent, and
      later it is found that they do not have enough tissue to contribute to the research pool,
      they will not be charged for the cryopreservation.

      Either the participant or their insurance company, Medicare or Medicaid will be responsible
      for the costs of all care and treatment that the participant would receive during this study
      that she would normally receive for her condition. These are costs that are considered
      medically reasonable and necessary and will be part of the care she receives if she does not
      take part in this study. This includes the confirmatory HIV testing and the follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) testing.

      There are also costs associated with the handling, processing, shipping and storage of
      ovarian tissue. Those costs are outlined in the study informed consent document.

      In the unlikely event that the participant is hurt or injured while participating in this
      study the medical costs related to their care and treatment will be their responsibility or
      submitted to their insurance. Also, the University of Kentucky or Norton Healthcare will not
      pay for any wages they may lose if they are harmed by this study.
