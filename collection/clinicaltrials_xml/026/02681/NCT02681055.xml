    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, proof-of-principle, open-label study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of MN-001 in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) subjects with hypertriglyceridemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist a Screening Phase (up to 4 months) followed by a Treatment Phase (12
      weeks), and a Follow-up visit (within 1 week after the last dose). A total of 40 male and
      female subjects ≥18 years of age are planned to be enrolled. During the Screening Phase,
      subjects will be assessed for study eligibility. After signing the informed consent form,
      the following assessments will be performed: medical history including review of prior and
      current medications, physical examination including height and body weight, waist
      circumference, vital signs and an electrocardiogram. Clinical labs, routine chemistries,
      hematology, coagulation profile, urinalysis and a serum pregnancy test will be collected as
      well as cytokeratin-18 (CK-18), a biomarker for NASH diagnosis. An alcohol consumption
      questionnaire will be administered and a MRI scan of the liver will be performed. Serum
      fibrosis markers, the Fib-4 index (age, AST, ALT, PLT) and NAFLD fibrosis score (age, BMI,
      AST/ALT ratio, IFG/DM, PLT, Albumin) will be calculated.

             subject if they were to participate in the study or that might confound the results
             of the study. Note: Active medical conditions that are minor or well-controlled are
             not exclusionary if, in the judgment of the Investigator, they do not affect risk to

             consulted.

             prior to screening. The only exceptions include caffeine or nicotine
             abuse/dependence.

          -  Poor peripheral venous access that will limit the ability to draw blood as judged by
             the Investigator.

             marketed compound or device within 3 months prior to signing the informed consent.
