      This clinical research study tests the Uronav system. Patients with prostate cancer will be
      asked to take part in this study.

      Uronav system is an investigational device that is used on this study to help place markers
      in the patient. These are called fiducial markers and they are placed in the patient to help
      plan radiation treatment. Radiation therapy treatment will be planned by the treating
      physician and will not be experimental or part of this research study.

      This study will also test the similarities and differences of biopsy tissue structures and
      the findings from the intraprostatic MRI (internally guided MRI).

      Study Objectives

      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate final pathology post-operatively for histopathology confirmation of
      multiparametric MRI targets detected during treatment planning. This will be accomplished by
      using transperineal biopsies obtained prior to interstitial brachytherapy during the
      procedure, while under anesthetic just prior to the placement of the brachytherapy needles
      and sources.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the ability of the Uronav system in a transperineal setting to
      guide biopsy needle placement using the electromagnetic guidance system and transperineal
      ultrasound probe stabilization device and stepper.

Patients will be prepped in a dorsal lithotomy position with insertion of a Foley catheter. The perineum will be shaved as needed, and cleansed with antiseptic solution, and the scrotum will be elevated with a towel roll to expose the perineum.</description>

    <description>An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a scan that uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to provide images of internal organs and tissues. This is not part of the study but will have been done per standard treatment. An MRI will occur at the screening visit and last visit of the study.</description>

             increased risk for urinary obstruction.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.
