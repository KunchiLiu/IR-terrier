  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, non-randomized, single institution, observational study investigating the
      effect of dramatic weight loss secondary to bariatric surgery on biomarkers of breast cancer
      in tissue and blood as well as on imaging in women at elevated risk for breast cancer.
      Twelve months after bariatric surgery, 50% of excess weight is generally expected. Eligible
      women at elevated risk for breast cancer who are already planning to undergo bariatric
      surgery will be consented to undergo imaging (MRI and mammogram), breast tissue biopsy, and
      fasting blood draw prior to bariatric surgery, approximately 14 days after bariatric
      surgery, and approximately 1 year after bariatric surgery.

      In parallel we will also be assessing 40 normal breast tissue specimens as well as blood
      samples from the Komen Tissue Bank (elevated risk but normal BMI) to establish a normal BMI,
      elevated risk control group for our study. The KTB samples will be matched for general risk
      of breast cancer (&gt;20%), age, race and menopausal status.

      Primary Objectives

        1. The effect of bariatric surgery on Background Parenchymal Enhancement (BPE) in breast
           MRI through comparative analysis of images of women pre- and 1 year post-bariatric
           surgery.

        2. The effect of bariatric surgery on breast density as seen on standard four view
           mammograms and processed with a commercial volumetric breast density measurement
           software (volpara®density™) through comparative analysis of images of women pre- and 1
           year post-bariatric surgery.

           Secondary Objectives

        3. The impact of bariatric surgery on obesity associated immune markers in breast tissue
           by:

             -  Comparing the cellular immune components in normal breast tissue lobules by
                looking at immune infiltrates [B cells (CD20), cytotoxic T cells (CD8), helper T
                cells (CD4), dendritic cells (CD11c), leukocytes (CD45), and monocytes/macrophages
                (CD68)] in normal breast of lean women and obese women pre- and 14 day and 1 year
                post-bariatric surgery.

             -  Assessing the presence of crown like structures (CLS) in normal breast of lean
                women and obese women pre- and 14 day and 1 year post-bariatric surgery.

        4. The effect of bariatric surgery on aromatase expression in breast tissue of women pre-
           and 14 day and 1 year post-bariatric surgery as compared to levels in breast tissue of
           lean women from Komen Tissue Bank (KTB).

        5. The effects of bariatric surgery on other blood correlatives pre- and 14 day and 1 year
           post-bariatric surgery including: 1) PGE2, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, IL-8 and IL-10 in the
           inflammatory pathway; 2) adiponectin, leptin, insulin, IGF1, and IGFBP3 in the insulin
           pathway; and 3) estradiol, SHBG, E2, T and DHEAS in the hormonal pathway.

        40 total patients will be enrolled to the high risk/BMI &gt; 30 cohort. 20 patients must be
        pre-menopausal and 20 patients must be post-menopausal women. Post-menopausal women are
        defined as: (1) those ≥ 50 years of age who had not menstruated during the preceding 12
        months or who had castrate follicle-stimulating hormone levels (&gt;40IU/L), (2) those who
        had undergone a bilateral oophorectomy.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patient must be at elevated risk for breast cancer, with more than 20% lifetime risk
             calculated by any one of the known risk models (Gail, Claus, Tyrer-Cusick or Hughes
             models) or based on a personal history of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or
             atypical hyperplasia.

          2. Patients must have a BMI ≥ 30 as calculated by the formula:

             Weight in pounds / height squared x 703 = BMI

             A BMI of:

               1. 18.5-24.9 is considered normal;

               2. 25.0-29.9 is considered overweight;

               3. 30.0+ is regarded as obese.

          3. Patients must be willing to provide a core tissue biopsy at baseline and with repeat
             tissue collection after 2 weeks and 12 months post-bariatric surgery.

          4. ECOG Performance Status of 0 - 1 within 28 days of registration. (Appendix I)

          5. Aged 18-75 years

          6. Subjects must be accessible for treatment, adverse event tracking and follow-up as
             determined by the treating physician.

          7. Subject consent and authorization for the release of health information must be
             obtained according to local institutional guidelines.

          8. Patients must be planning to undergo primary bariatric surgery (no revisions).

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. No history of any malignancy except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer,
             curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumors curatively
             treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5 years.

          2. No concurrent or planned participation in randomized trials of weight loss or
             exercise interventions or trials targeting insulin, IGF-1 or their receptors. These
             interventions would interfere with the endpoints.

          3. Weight cannot exceed 500 lbs at the time of imaging.

          4. Known allergy to gadolinium which is used for MRI contrast.
