  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the safety and clinical effect of combined checkpoint
      inhibition administered after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in each of
      six clinical cohorts of high risk and recurrent disease. In addition to assessing the
      incidence and severity of adverse events and rates of complete response and progression free
      survival, investigators intend to monitor immune reconstitution, phenotype and TCR
      repertoire throughout treatment and at the time of disease progression. Investigators will
      also analyze the gut microbiome prior to conditioning, throughout treatment, post-transplant
      and at time of relapse.

      This is a phase Ib-IIA study of post-transplant combined check point inhibitors for patients
      with a high risk of relapse (&gt;50%) after an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

      Patients will accrue to study by disease groups and followed separately by group for
      incidence and severity of toxicity, ability to receive intended schedule of combined check
      point inhibitors and for complete response and progression free survival (PFS) rates.
      Complete response and progression free survival rates will be compared to published
      standards for each disease group. Expected PFS at 18 months for all post-transplant groups
      without check point inhibitors is less than 50%. Each group with PFS at 18 months in 4 or
      more patients (57%) will be considered for eligibility in a successor phase IIB expansion
      trial.

          -  Be 18 years or older and 80 years or younger on the day of signing consent

          -  Have a confirmed diagnosis of:

               -  De novo diffuse large B cell lymphoma that failed to achieve a PET negative
                  complete response to primary rituximab and anthracycline based multi-agent
                  chemotherapy and at least maintain stable disease after salvage chemotherapy.
                  Stable disease (SD) for lymphoma is defined as no progression and failure to
                  achieve at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of
                  up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses
                  should be selected according to all of the following: they should be clearly
                  measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions; if possible they should be
                  from disparate regions of the body; and they should include mediastinal and
                  retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.

               -  Recurrent high risk diffuse large B cell lymphoma defined as relapsing within
                  one year of initiation of rituximab and anthracycline based multi-agent
                  chemotherapy or a sAAIPI (second-line age-adjusted International Prognostic
                  Index) intermediate or high at relapse and at least stable disease after salvage
                  chemotherapy.

               -  De novo high risk T cell lymphoma with at least stable disease after primary
                  therapy. High risk T cell lymphoma is defined as Stage III or IV disease at
                  presentation; failure to achieve CR after frontline chemotherapy.

               -  Recurrent T cell lymphoma with at least stable disease after salvage therapy.

                  GEP 70 scores, t(4;14), t(14;16) and t(14;20), hypodiploidy. For patients with
                  both cytogenetic aberrations and a GEP 70 score, the GEP 70 score will supercede
                  the cytogenetics for the purpose of risk stratification.

               -  Recurrent myeloma within 3 years after a single autologous transplant and at
                  least stable disease after salvage therapy. Stable disease for multiple myeloma
                  is defined as failure to achieve at least 50% reduction of serum M-protein and
                  reduction in 24h-urinary M-protein of at least 90%.

          -  Be deemed eligible for an autologous stem cell transplantation as per institutional
             guidelines of the Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program at John Theurer Cancer

          -  Have a performance status of 2 or lower on ECOG performance scale

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to receiving the first dose of ipilimumab and
             nivolumab. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum
             pregnancy test will be required. Female subjects of childbearing potential should
             agree to ongoing pregnancy testing, to be performed prior to each dosing of
             ipilimumab and nivolumab

          -  Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control
             or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the
             study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 2 years.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with females of
             childbearing potential even if they have had a successful vasectomy starting with the
             first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

             abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the
             subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best
             interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.
