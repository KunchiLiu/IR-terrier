      This study will focus on enhancing future smoking cessation treatment effectiveness by
      piloting a potentially more powerful combination of three FDA-approved pharmacotherapies:
      varenicline plus combination of two types of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) treatment
      (nicotine lozenge and nicotine patch). Data from this pilot study will help inform the
      design of future studies that would use this combination treatment as a cessation tool
      within the chronic care arsenal of treatments.

      Recent research suggests that a new combination therapy may be especially effective in
      increasing long-term abstinence from smoking. A key purpose of the proposed study is to
      examine what types of tolerability concerns, if any, emerge from the simultaneous use of
      three FDA-approved cessation medications (varenicline, nicotine patch, and nicotine lozenge)
      and the timing of those events, in order to better assess how the use of this combination of
      tobacco cessation medicines can be most effectively and safely delivered and monitored.
      Study participants will take the three medications for 12 weeks in a manner consistent with
      labeling. Adverse events will be assessed at all study visits.
