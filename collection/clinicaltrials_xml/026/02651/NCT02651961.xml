  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic infection after total joint arthroplasty generally requires implant exchange. Two
      stage exchange is considered as the gold standard procedure. However, some authors suggest
      that one stage exchange may be as effective. No consensus exists in the current literature.
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the cost of both strategies in comparison to their
      success rate.

      The primary criterion will be the cost-utility ratio (ICER) at 12 months follow-up.

      The secondary criteria will be:

        -  quality of life;

        -  pain;

        -  persistence or recurrence of infection;

        -  occurrence of complications ;

        -  necessity for reoperation.
