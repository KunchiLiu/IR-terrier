      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study of REGN2810 and REGN1979 in
      patients with lymphoma or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The study treatment period
      will be from 6 to 12 months, depending on how an individual patient responds to treatment.
      The follow-up period will be 6 months for all patients.

             options exists.

          2. Must have at least 1 bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (≥1.5 cm) documented by
             diagnostic imaging (CT, PET-CT or MRI).

          4. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation

          5. Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the programmed death-1/ programmed

          4. Adequate organ function

          5. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

          6. Provide signed informed consent

        Key Exclusion Criteria for ALL:

          1. History or current central nervous system (CNS) pathology

          2. Burkitt's leukemia

          3. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation less than 3 months of treatment

          4. Concurrent active malignancy for which the patient is receiving treatment

          5. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or chronic/active infection
             with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus
