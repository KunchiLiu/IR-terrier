      Comparison of an optical method to continuously measure blood pressure against an invasive
      arterial catheter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of blood pressure during anesthesia is commonly performed by the inflation
      of a brachial cuff providing only intermittent blood pressure measurements. In some case, it
      is required to add a continuous invasive monitoring of blood pressure, via the insertion of
      an arterial catheter. Unfortunately, the related morbidity is not negligible. To limit the
      consequences of such a gesture, some developments have been done in the past to allow for
      continuous non-invasive measurements of blood pressure during anesthesia. Unfortunately,
      most of these devices are subject to important limitations and constraints of use.

      A new system has been designed by CSEM consisting of an optical system fixed on patient's
      skin, absolutely non-invasive and easy to use. In order to study the reliability of this
      device, the investigators plan to compare its blood pressure estimates against gold-standard
      arterial catheter measurements during induction of general anesthesia on 40 patients.

    <description>The signals recorded by the optical blood pressure device will be retrospectively analysed (offline analysis) in order to test the hypothesis that mean blood pressure values as derived by the new device is comparable to blood pressure values as measured by an arterial catheter within the limits of agreement in mmHg stated by ISO 81060-2 2013.</description>
