  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Flemish version of the Life Balance Inventory (LBI), measuring central constructs of
      life balance, will be validated in a stroke population. Upon approval by the ethical
      committee, stroke patients will be recruited when they are at least six months post stroke
      (n = 30). The LBI will be administered twice with one week interval, and demographic,
      socio-economic variables and other measures of health related quality of life will be
      collected.

      Next, an observational prospective longitudinal study will be set up. We will recruit stroke
      patients in three rehabilitation centers within one week after admission in the
      rehabilitation center. Patients will undergo a baseline evaluation and will be re-assessed
      at discharge from the rehabilitation center, at six months and at 12 months post stroke. A
      standardized clinical assessment battery, measuring motor, sensory, cognitive, mental and
      functional outcomes as well as personal and environmental factors will be administered. This
      observational study will explore recovery patterns of bimanual activities after stroke from
      baseline evaluation to six and 12 months after stroke. Also the predictive value of motor,
      sensory, cognitive and mental outcomes on bimanual activities at six and 12 months post
      stroke is studied, based on data collected on admission to the rehabilitation center.
      Finally, changes over time in life balance and its determinants will be examined at six and
      12 months post stroke. The predictive value of motor, cognitive and functional outcomes on
      life balance at one year post stroke will be examined, based on data collected on admission
      to the rehabilitation center. Furthermore the influence of bimanual activities on life
      balance will be explored in the chronic stage after stroke.
