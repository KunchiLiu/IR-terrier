    <textblock>
      Multicenter phase 1/2 study of neoadjuvant Ibrutinib in men with localized prostate cancer
      undergoing RP as their initial locally directed therapy with curative intent. To assess the
      immune response following neoadjuvant treatment, tissue from RP specimen will be compared to
      tissue from core biopsy specimen obtained prior to treatment, with each subject serving as
      his own control. Immune infiltration will also be compared to a reference cohort of 12
      patients who had undergone RP, matched to the study population using the UCSF CAPRA-S score.

          -  Platelet count &gt;100,000 cells/mm3

          -  Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine &lt;2 mg/dL or CrCl &gt;30 mL/min

          -  Adequate liver function, defined as:

          -  Serum bilirubin &lt;1.5x institutional ULN

          -  Adequate coagulation function, defined as normal PT/INR and PTT

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Available evaluable archival tumor tissue for correlative studies including
             assessment of immune infiltration and Btk expression is required. If archival tissue
             is unavailable, patients must be willing to undergo repeat prostate biopsy. Tissue is
             considered sufficient for correlative endpoint analyses if they are obtained from at
             least 2 prostate cores and consist of at least 15 unstained slides from the largest
             tumor volume and/or highest Gleason score. The availability of archival tissue or
             consent for repeat prostate biopsy is required for study eligibility; determination
             of tissue sufficiency is not required for study eligibility.

          -  The effects of ibrutinib on the developing human fetus is unknown. Men treated or
             enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the
             study, for the duration of the study participation, and for 3 months after completion
             of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with neuroendocrine or small cell features are not eligible.

          -  Any evidence of metastatic disease. Pre-operative staging will be undertaken per
             urologic standard of care.

          -  Any prior use of hormonal therapy, including:

          -  GNRH agonists or GNRH antagonists (e.g., leuprorelin, degarelix)

          -  Antiandrogens (e.g., bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide)

          -  Novel androgen-directed therapies (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide)

          -  Any estrogen containing compounds

          -  5-alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride)

          -  PC-SPES or PC-x products. Other herbal therapies or supplements will be considered by
             the Principle Investigator on a case by case basis based on their potential for
             hormonal or anti-cancer therapies.

          -  Prior use of immunotherapy or chemotherapy for prostate cancer

          -  Prior radiation therapy for prostate cancer

          -  Prior investigational therapy for prostate cancer

          -  Patients may not receive any other concurrent investigational agents while on study.

          -  Use of systemic steroid therapy within 28 days of study screening. Patients on
             inhaled or topical steroids are eligible.

          -  Major surgery requiring the use of general anesthetic within 4 weeks of study
             enrollment

          -  HIV, active hepatitis B (HBV) or active hepatitis C (HCV)

          -  Patients with past HBV infection or resolved HBV infection, defined as the presence
             of hepatitis B core antibody (HBc Ab) and absence of hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg) are eligible. HBV DNA must be obtained in these patients prior to day 1 of
             ibrutinib therapy, but detection of HBV DNA in these patients will not exclude study
             participation.

          -  Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is
             negative for HCV RNA.

          -  Inability to swallow capsules or presence of malabsorption syndromes, disease
             significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, history of resection of the
             stomach or small bowel, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis,
             or partial or complete small obstruction.

          -  Currently active, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, such as uncontrolled
             arrhythmia or Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure as defined by the New York Heart
             Association Function Classification; or a history of myocardial infarction, unstable
             angina, or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness, or any underlying medical condition, which in the
             Principal Investigator's opinion will make the administration of ibrutinib hazardous
             or obscure the interpretation of adverse events.

          -  Concurrent active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers. Patients are
             considered to be free of active malignancy if they have completed curative therapy
             and have a &lt;30% risk of relapse.

          -  Moderate or severe hepatic impairment defined as Child-Pugh Class B or C.

          -  History of congenital bleeding diathesis.

          -  Concomitant use of anticoagulants including warfarin, other Vitamin K antagonists,
             and enoxaparin.

          -  Patients who require treatment with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor.

          -  Vaccination with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.

          -  Patients on anti-platelet agents including clopidogrel and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
             inhibitors. Aspirin is allowed, but should be held before surgery according to
             standard practices.
