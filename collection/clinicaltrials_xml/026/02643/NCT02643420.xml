    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of a single dose of SPI-2012 with
      pegfilgrastim (Neulasta [NDC 55513-190-01] manufactured by Amgen) in patients with
      early-stage breast cancer receiving docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC), as measured by the
      Duration of Severe Neutropenia (DSN) in Cycle 1.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study to compare
      the efficacy and safety of SPI-2012 (a long acting myeloid growth factor) with pegfilgrastim
      (Neulasta [NDC 55513-190-01] manufactured by Amgen) in breast cancer patients treated with
      TC chemotherapy.

      Approximately 580 patients will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment
      arms.

      Each cycle will be 21 days. Only 4 cycles will be evaluated for this study. On Day 1 of each
      cycle, patients will receive TC chemotherapy. On Day 2 of each cycle, patients will receive
      study drug (SPI-2012 or pegfilgrastim).

      After Cycle 1, all patients who have received at least one dose of study drug will be
      followed for 12 months after the last dose of study treatment for safety follow-up.
