    <textblock>
      Primiparae with a live singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation past 34 gestational
      weeks will be randomized to lateral episiotomy or no episiotomy when operative vaginal
      delivery is indicated. Primary outcome is obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) of any
      degree.

      Women giving birth at Danderyd Hospital will be included. Danderyd Hospital is a large
      teaching hospital affiliated to the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. Danderyd
      Hospital attends approximately 6 000 deliveries annually, of which 300 are vacuum
      extractions in primiparae. Other hospitals in Stockholm County and other parts of Sweden
      will also be invited to participate in the study.

      Lateral episiotomy will be performed according to the intervention description. Total sample
      size has been calculated to 700 women, if a reduction in sphincter tear frequency from
      today's 14.6% to 7.3% in operative vaginal deliveries is to be detected (estimated drop-out
      rate 30%). The women will be recruited over a maximum of 48 months. An interim analysis will
      be performed after 120 randomized women to each arm, since a reduction to less than 5%
      sphincter tears could be detected with less than 5% risk of a type-1 error at this sample
      size. If such a large reduction is seen, the study will be closed.

      Data will be collected prospectively through Case Record Forms and the obstetrical medical
      file Obstetrix (Cerner Sverige AB), which covers approximately 98% of deliveries with
      complete data, and the Swedish Pregnancy Register covering the whole of Sweden from 2015 as
      well as the (optional) Swedish Obstetrical Tear Register, which Danderyd Hospital is a part
      of since 2014. From the Obstetrical Tear Registry, questionnaires are sent out in paper form
      or electronically to patients with a diagnosed anal sphincter tear at delivery, 8 weeks and
      12 months after delivery. The same questionnaires will be used in the follow-up of the study
      participants regardless of randomization or result (sphincter tear or not). In addition, the
      participants will be sent questionnaires regarding birth satisfaction at 8 weeks after
      delivery.
