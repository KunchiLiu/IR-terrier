      The study will include three (3) phases: Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Follow-up
      Phase. Subjects who qualify to participate will apply study drug to their feet three times
      daily and will record their daily pain scores using an interactive voice response system
      (IVRS) during the Treatment Phase for 12 weeks. Approximately 100 adult subjects will be
      randomized to receive Clonidine Gel or Clonidine Gel Comparator.

      Study CLO-291 is a randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled, parallel-group,
      multicenter study of 0.1% clonidine topical gel (Clonidine Gel) for the treatment of pain
      associated with painful diabetic neuropathy. The study will include three (3) phases:
      Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Follow-up Phase. Subjects who satisfy all eligibility
      criteria will apply Clonidine Gel Comparator to their feet three times daily and will record
      their daily pain scores using an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Approximately 100
      adult subjects will be randomized to receive Clonidine Gel or Clonidine Gel Comparator
      during the 12 week Treatment Phase.

          3. Subject has Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus with a hemoglobin A1C value &lt; 10% and
             has been stable on therapy (diet, oral anti-hyperglycemic, and/or insulin) for at
             least six (6) months prior to the Screening Visit.

          4. Subject is a male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female. Females must be practicing
             an acceptable method of birth control or be surgically sterile or postmenopausal
             (amenorrhea for ≥12 months). A negative pregnancy test at the Screening and Day 1
             visits is required for females of child-bearing potential. Double-barrier methods,
             hormonal contraceptives, and abstinence are acceptable birth control methods for this
             study.

          5. Subject has chronic pain attributable to a symmetrical stocking distribution
             neuropathy in the lower extremities for at least six (6) months. Pain should be
             clearly localized to the area of neuropathy (feet), and subjects should be able to
             distinguish the target pain from other painful areas and conditions.

          6. Subject has an average pain score relevant to the target pain in the feet of ≥4 on an
             11 point numerical pain rating scale over the previous 24 hours at the Screening
             Visit.

          7. Subject meets a pre-specified, minimum numerical pain rating scale score following
             capsaicin skin challenge.

          8. Subject must satisfactorily complete Accurate Pain Reporting and Minimizing Placebo
             Response Training.

          9. Subject must have moderate to severe pain during the Screening Run-in Phase.

         10. Subjects must be 75 to 110% compliant with application of study drug during the
             Screening Run-in Phase

         11. Subject has been medically stable for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit,
             and in the opinion of the Investigator, is in otherwise good general health based on
             medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has neuropathy secondary to non-diabetic causes in the opinion of the

             hepatitis, malignancy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [CIDP],
             human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], medication-induced neuropathy, vitamin B12
             deficiency).

          2. Subject has a significant neurological disorder or condition that might confound
             assessment of painful diabetic neuropathy (e.g., stroke with distal neurological
             deficit, mononeuritis multiplex, lumbar radiculopathy).

          3. Subject has a confounding disorder as determined by the Algorithm for Excluding
             Disorders that Masquerade as Painful Diabetic Neuropathy.

          4. Subject has other sustained pain with intensity at or greater than the bilateral
             neuropathic pain in the feet.

          5. Subject is using an implanted medical device (e.g., spinal cord stimulator,
             intrathecal pump, or peripheral nerve stimulator) for treatment of pain.

          6. Subject is hypotensive with a resting diastolic blood pressure &lt;60 mm Hg or a
             systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg at the Screening or Day 1 Visit.

          7. The subject has recent history (within the past 3 months) or current symptoms of
