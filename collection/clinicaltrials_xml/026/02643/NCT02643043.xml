      This comprehensive genomic analysis and biospecimen repository study incorporates Next
      Generation Sequencing (NGS) of archival tumor tissue from 200 subjects with metastatic
      urothelial cancer in support of several parallel goals. The immediate goal involves
      generation of a comprehensive report identifying subject specific genetic mutations and/or
      alterations based on NGS. Once NGS is complete, DNA and RNA extracted from the specimens and
      any remaining blocks/slides/curls will be stored for future research. Long-term, the goal of
      this endeavor is to support collaborative translational research projects in metastatic
      urothelial cancer by allowing investigators to interrogate abstracted coded clinical data
      linked to data from any biospecimen studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      STUDY PLAN:

      SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION AND CONSENT:

      Sites may approach all subjects who attend an appointment for evaluation of metastatic
      urothelial cancer for inclusion. Study staff review consent documents with potential
      subjects and answer any and all questions. A subject is allowed to delay enrollment in the
      study and informed about how to ask questions or enroll at a later date.

      BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION AND PROCESSING:

      When subjects are consented for entry into this study, they consent to access of any
      archival tumor tissue (whether from the primary or any metastatic site) for genetic
      analysis. Further, subjects consent to the indefinite use of their specimens and linked
      clinical information for ongoing or future biomedical research. Additionally, sites inform
      subjects during the consent process that researchers may use their information for genetic
      research including research on somatic or germline mutations. Analyses will be performed on
      coded (de-identified) data/specimens

      Collection of Archived Tumor Samples:

        -  After the subject is consented, sites will request primary and/or metastatic archived
           tumor tissue. At least 60μm of tissue with at least 20% tumor content is needed for the
           analyses. Ideally, the tissue submitted will contain ≥ 40% tumor content. Sites will
           send tissue directly to Paradigm.

        -  Sites will also request corresponding pathology report(s). Each institution can use its
           own standard operating procedure for the preparation of the FFPE material. Each
           participating site will ship specimens accessed under GU15-217 directly to Paradigm.

      Collection of Blood for Research Purposes Only:

        -  Whole blood for research purposes only (including germline analysis) is collected from
           each subject. Any DNA analysis of blood is for research purposes only and will be
           performed on coded (de-identified) samples. Blood samples collected under UC-GENOME is
           shipped from each participating site to the BCAN Biobank at HCRN .

      PARADIGM TESTING:

      Upon receipt of a tumor specimen from each enrolled subject, Paradigm can enrich each sample
      for tumor via Laser Capture Enrichment (LCE), a proprietary high throughput process, if
      required, prior to isolation of DNA and RNA. Paradigm will then perform comprehensive DNA
      analysis (including mutations, gene fusions, and copy number variations) via its Paradigm
      Cancer Diagnostic (PCDx) test.

      Report Generation:

        -  Following NGS analysis, Paradigm generates a subject specific report that includes a
           summary of genomic alterations highlighting those variations considered potentially
           actionable, a concise discussion of the molecular analyses by Paradigm pathologists and
           oncologists as well as a BCGC expert panel, a list of potential clinical trials
           incorporating relevant targeted agents, and potential therapeutic options based on the
           specific alterations discovered along with associated levels of evidence for each. The
           BCGC expert panel works with Paradigm to ensure that all potential clinical trials are
           represented in the individual subject reports.

      Storage for Future Research:

        -  The BCAN Biobank at Hoosier Cancer Research Network (HCRN) will store DNA and RNA
           isolated for the study, and any biospecimens remaining after this isolation, for future
           biomedical research. If at any point a subject wishes to withdraw from the study, HCRN
           will destroy any specimens that it may link to the subject. We are unable to stop the
           use of any specimens that have been stripped of all identifying information or links to
           identifying information.

      COMMUNICATION OF NGS RESULTS TO PROVIDER AND SUBJECT:

      After testing with PCDx is complete, Paradigm provides a subject specific report to the
      subject's treating physician (typically in 4-5 business days from receipt of tumor tissue)
      and HCRN. During the informed consent process, sites inform each subject that his or her
      physician will communicate results of the genetic testing on their tumor specimens. Along
      with the results that are communicated, the subjects' treating physician will explain the
      implications of their testing results, including whether their genetic profiles render them
      potentially eligible for a specific therapy or clinical trial. Sites also inform subjects
      that researchers will store any specimens remaining after genetic profiling of their tumor
      is complete. Storage continues indefinitely for future biomedical research. This may include
      development of commercial products from their specimens.

      Sites must explain to subjects that although a blood sample is being obtained, this study is
      not aimed at discovering germline mutations. Sites must emphasize that genetic analyses
      performed within this study should not be construed as genetic testing for genetic mutations
      associated with hereditary cancer susceptibility. Nevertheless, because NGS may be performed
      on blood, it is possible that a germline mutation that predisposes a subject to cancer will
      incidentally be discovered. Subjects will not receive any information about such mutations,
      however, as this analysis will be performed on de-identified samples.

      ABSTRACTION OF MEDICAL RECORDS:

      Research staff at each site abstracts clinical information from each subject and enters the
      information into the web based clinical research platform, OnCore®. Data abstracted includes
      details on the following: demographics, cancer diagnosis, cancer stage, surgical and medical
      management, any treatment decisions made in response to the NGS results communicated to the
      physician and any response/longer term outcome data as a result of these treatment
      decisions.

      ACCESS TO DATA/SPECIMENS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH:

      The database links coded clinical and genetic data, creating a biospecimen and data
      repository. These data, along with biospecimens stored at HCRN, will ultimately be available
      for researchers with BCGC-approved and IRB-approved studies allowing access to these
      data/specimens, and with HCRN managing the data, protecting the confidentiality of study
      subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in
        this study:

          -  IRB-approved written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and
             Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) authorization for release of personal health
             information; NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or
             obtained separately.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial cancer of the bladder, urethra,
             ureter, or renal pelvis.

          -  Metastatic urothelial cancer as defined by M1 (distant metastatic disease) and/or N3
             (nodes outside of the true pelvis) at the time of enrollment.

          -  Tumor tissue available and suitable for molecular analyses from at least one of the
             following sources:

               -  Tissue previously stored at enrolling institution

               -  Tissue previously stored at an outside institution (other than enrolling
                  institution)

          -  Available tumor tissue must be from a FFPE block with minimum tumor content of 20%
             (optimally ≥ 40%). To best meet tumor content requirements, the FFPE block should
             contain 75mm of tissue. The tissue specimen may come from blocks/slides/curls
             accessed under UC-GENOME from enrolled subjects. NOTE: Prior to trial registration,
             the tumor content will be confirmed by central pathology review at Paradigm (a Next
             Generation Sequencing Company). If the tissue submitted does not meet the tumor
             cellularity requirements, additional tissue will be requested. If no further tissue
             is submitted or available, the subject will be ineligible to participate.
