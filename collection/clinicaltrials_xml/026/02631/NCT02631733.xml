      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together
      with liposomal irinotecan in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other
      parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Liposomal irinotecan and
      veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of MM-398 (liposomal
      irinotecan) + veliparib combination.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the
      combination of MM-398 + veliparib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To characterize the preliminary efficacy
      of the combination using key efficacy indicators, such as objective response rate, clinical
      benefit rate defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease
      (SD) at 24 weeks, and progression free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES I. Imaging, tumor, and blood biomarkers to assess the sensitivity or
      resistance to each drug and correlation with clinical response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation of veliparib.

      Patients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15
      and veliparib orally (PO) on days 5-12 and 19-25 or 3-12 and 17-25. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
