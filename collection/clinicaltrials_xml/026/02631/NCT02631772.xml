  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The predominant remaining questions for post-transplant treatment of HCV in the DAA era are
      whether a ribavirin-free regimen is possible and whether pre-emptive treatment is now a
      potential option to prevent long-term damage to the allograft.

      Our aim is to provide answers to these primary questions with our multicenter, prospective,
      randomized, open-label intent-to-treat phase IV study

      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label phase IV study including two
      subgroups:

        1. Early Cohort -- Compare ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment for 8 weeks vs. 12 weeks in
           patients within 90 days of liver transplant

        2. Late Cohort -- Compare ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin for 12 weeks vs
           ledipasvir/sofosbuvir alone for 12 weeks in patients over 90 days post-liver transplant
