  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the LoS from treatment of oral
      anticoagulant initiation to hospital discharge of patients hospitalized and subsequently
      treated with dabigatran or warfarin for non-valvular atrial fibrillation in a real-world
      Japanese clinical practice. The secondary objective of the study is to compare LoS of
      patients hospitalized with 1) acute ischemic stroke, and 2) due to non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation. Other objectives are (1) to compare the in-hospital direct and
      indirect-related costs between dabigatran and warfarin, and (2) to compare the rates of
      patients directly discharged at home after the index hospitalization between dabigatran and
      warfarin.

        Inclusion criteria:

        1. Hospitalized patients among patients having a visit record with a confirmed diagnosis
        of NVAF (ICD-10 Code: I48) and prescribed dabigatran or warfarin in the hospitalization
        period

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Having a record with a diagnosis of atrial flutter, valvular atrial fibrillation or
             postoperative atrial fibrillation diagnosis as standard disease name during the study
             period.

          2. Having a record with a diagnosis of rheumatic atrial fibrillation (ICD-10 code I05 to
             I09 [chronic rheumatic atrial fibrillation])or mechanical-valvular atrial
             fibrillation (ICD-10 code T820 [artificial cardiac valve mechanical complication])
             during the study period.

          3. Having a record with a confirmed diagnosis of cancer (ICD-10 code C00-C97 [malignant
             neoplasm]) during the study period.

          4. Having a record of dialysis (class J038 artificial kidney) during the study period.

          5. Having a record of dabigatran use for a purpose other than prevention of ischemic
             stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients.

          6. Having a record of dabigatran or warfarin before the hospitalization

          7. Having a record of new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation after the initiation of
             dabigatran or warfarin treatment in the hospitalization period.
