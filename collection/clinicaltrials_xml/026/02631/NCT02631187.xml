  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study that aims to evaluate the feasibility of undertaking a United Kingdom (UK)
      multi-centre randomised controlled trial of BET for the treatment of moderate (grade 2 or 3)
      retraction pockets (RPs). This future study will aim to address the question: Does BET
      improve symptoms scores, audiometry and otoscopic appearance of Grade 2-3 pars tensa RPs in
      adult patients?

      Currently conservative treatments for this condition has been shown to be ineffective; there
      is a significant risk of progression to hearing loss or more serious complications in
      untreated retraction pockets; and the surgical treatments available to us in the UK not only
      have a number of risks and drawbacks, but also do not aim to treat the underlying cause
      (Eustachian Tube dysfunction (ETD)).

    <description>Thematic analysis of Patient Focus Group discussions. Standardised questions and focus group discussion with patients with (i) un-operated asymptomatic Retraction Pockets (RPs), (ii) un-operated symptomatic RPs, (iii) RPs treated with cartilage tympanoplasty, and (iv) RPs treated with BET. These will qualitatively assess (as appropriate) positive and negative aspects of patient experience, such as living with the RP, the procedure itself, their recovery, any after effects, and participating in the study. Focus groups will consist of 6 patients in each group.</description>
