    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance profile of a modified
      surgical procedure and custom Delivery System and also to assess the effects on best
      corrected visual acuity of a single subretinal administration of CNTO 2476.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study) study which includes an initial unmasked safety phase, followed by a
      randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), masked treatment efficacy
      phase for participants who have Geographic Atrophy. The study consists of 2 Phases: Open
      label safety Run-in Phase followed by double-masked randomized treatment Phase. The duration
      of participation in the study for each participant is approximately 5 years. Efficacy will
      be evaluated at 6 months, 12 months and annually thereafter. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration
             (AMD) confirmed within 45 days prior to initial randomization verified by the central
             reading center

          -  Study eyes will have a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/80 to 20/800 [Early
             Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) log of the minimum angle of resolution
             (logMAR) value 0.6-1.6]. The treatment eye will be that with the worse BCVA at
             Screening. If BCVA is clinically equivalent, the eye with the larger GA determines
             the study eye

          -  Participant is a suitable candidate for ophthalmologic surgery, is willing and able
             to comply with the surgical procedure, scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory
             tests and other study procedures. Participant has met criteria of the surgery center
             anti-coagulation protocol, if applicable

          -  Each participant must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she
             understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to
             participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a history of neovascular (&quot;wet&quot;) AMD in the treatment eye, including
             evidence of retinal pigment epithelium rips or evidence of subretinal or choroidal
             neovascularization or fluid. In cases where imaging is inconclusive, review of the
             case with the study site, considering history and imaging will determine eligibility.
             History or evidence of neovascular AMD in the fellow eye is allowed, if anti-vascular
             endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has not been required for at least 8 weeks
             prior to Screening

          -  Geographic atrophy secondary to any causes other than AMD in either eye

          -  A diagnosis of glaucoma with an intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than or equal to
             (&gt;=) 25 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) while being treated with an ocular hypotensive
             drug. Treatment should be no more than 1 drug preparation/combination, which can
             contain 1 or 2 ocular hypotensive active ingredients; participants receiving more
             than 2 ocular hypotensive active ingredients are excluded

          -  Nuclear sclerotic cataract, cortical spoking, posterior subcapsular cataract above
             Grade 2 per Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) scale or any other ophthalmologic
             condition that reduces the clarity of the media that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or reading center, interferes with ophthalmologic examination (example,
             corneal abnormalities, inadequate pupillary dilation), surgery or imaging in the
             study eye

          -  Myopia greater than minus (&gt;-) 8 diopters and participants with greater than (&gt;) 4
             diopters of astigmatism, and greater than plus (&gt;+) 10 diopters of hyperopia
