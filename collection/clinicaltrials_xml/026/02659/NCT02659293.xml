    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 randomized trial of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone versus
      lenalidomide alone after stem-cell transplant for multiple myeloma, eligible to subjects who
      completed autologous stem cell transplant for symptomatic myeloma who are considered for
      lenalidomide maintenance.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To compare progression free survival between Kyprolis (Carfilzomib), Revlimid
           (lenalidomide), Dexamethasone (KRd) arm and lenalidomide arm

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the rate of minimal residual negative disease (MRD) at 6 and 12 months
           after randomization

        -  To compare the efficacy (rate of partial response, very good partial response, complete
           response, and stringent complete response) of KRd vs. Lenalidomide alone after
           randomization

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who completed single autologous stem cell transplant after completion of at
             most 2 induction regimens (excluding dexamethasone alone) and are in at least stable
             disease in the first 100 days after stem cell transplantation.

          2. Patients must be within 12 months of initiation of induction therapy and must have
             had not more than 2 prior induction regimens.

          3. Bone marrow specimen will be required at study entry; available DNA sample will be
             used for calibration step for MRD evaluation by gene sequencing.

          4. Males and females ≥ 18 years of age

          5. ECOG performance status of 0-1

          6. Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN and aspirate aminotransferase
             (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3 x ULN

          7. ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L, hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL, platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L.
