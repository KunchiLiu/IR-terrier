      This pilot, partially randomized clinical trial studies how well glycosylated recombinant
      human interleukin-7 works in increasing low cluster of differentiation (CD)4 counts after
      concurrent radiation and temozolomide treatment in patients with gliomas that tend to grow
      rapidly and spread (high-grade). Treatment with radiation and chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, may cause an abnormal decrease in CD4 cells, which are an important part of
      the immune system. Glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 may increase CD4 cell counts
      and improve survival.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the effect of CYT107 (glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7) on CD4 counts
      compared to control.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the optimal dose of CYT107. II. To evaluate the effect of concurrent
      dexamethasone. III. To evaluate the duration of effect on CD4 counts (up to 6 months). IV.
      To evaluate the total lymphocyte counts over time and serial lymphocyte subtypes (up to 6
      months).

      V. To evaluate the serial cytokines levels (up to 6 months). VI. To evaluate the impact of
      adjuvant temozolomide on CYT107 effects on CD4 counts.

      VII. To evaluate anti-drug antibodies. VIII. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of CYT107
      in patients with high grade glioma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore overall survival in patients. II. Tumor infiltrative lymphocytes could be
      studied in patients undergoing resection of recurrent or progressive tumor.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups depending on their use of dexamethasone.

      GROUP A (NON-DEXAMETHASONE): Patients not on dexamethasone or on a dose lower than a
      physiologic dose (=&lt; 0.75 mg daily) are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A1: Patients receive placebo intramuscularly (IM) once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM A2: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 at 10 ug/kg IM once
      weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM A3: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 at 20 ug/kg IM once
      weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP B (DEXAMETHASONE): Patients requiring dexamethasone at more than a physiologic dose (&gt;
      0.75 mg daily) are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM B1: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 as in Arm A2.

      ARM B2: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 as in Arm A3.

      In all arms, patients receive adjuvant temozolomide on days 1-5 as per standard treatment
      beginning 2 weeks post-glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 treatment. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

    <description>The optimal dose will be selected based on the highest absolute increase of CD4 counts compared to the control if toxicity profiles are similar between the two dose levels. Otherwise, safety will be the first consideration for dose selection. The results of the two concurrent dexamethasone groups will be summarized with standard descriptive statistics. The dose selection criteria will be similar to the non-dexamethasone groups with priority on safety rather than the highest absolute increase of CD4 counts.</description>
