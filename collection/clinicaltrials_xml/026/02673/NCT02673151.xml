      This trial studies how well gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA ligand Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC
      (68Ga-PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) works in detecting
      prostate cancer that may have come back in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA) after initial treatment. A rise in blood level of PSA, a protein made by the prostate,
      after treatment with surgery or radiation in patients without symptoms indicates that the
      cancer may have come back (recurrence). PSA however cannot determine whether the disease is
      located only in the prostate or other places in the body. 68Ga-PSMA is a radioactive tracer
      that targets and specifically binds to tumor cells expressing PSA making them lighting up.
      PET and CT make computerizing pictures of areas inside the body where the radioactive
      substance is lighting up. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT may be able to see smaller tumors than standard
      imaging and may help determine whether prostate cancer has come back and where it is in the
      body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial
      therapy in patients with elevated PSA and non-contributory bone scintigraphy, computed
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA ligand Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC intravenously
      (IV). Beginning 45-60 minutes later, patients under whole body (skull base to mid-thighs)
      PET/CT scan.

      After completion of study procedure, patients are followed up every 12-24 weeks for 12
      months.
