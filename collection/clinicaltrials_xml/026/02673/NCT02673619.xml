  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Umeclidinium (UMEC) is a potent pan-active long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). It is
      anticipated that topical administration of UMEC will block stimulation of muscarinic
      receptors, thereby reducing the overproduction of sweat in subjects who suffer from
      hyperhidrosis. This study will assess the clinical effect, pharmacokinetics, safety and
      tolerability of topically applied UMEC following once daily topical administration, for 28
      days, to the palms, in subjects with primary palmar hyperhidrosis. The study will also
      investigate if topically applied UMEC, at the highest possible concentration, will decrease
      palmar hyperhidrosis with a systemic anticholinergic adverse event profile similar to or
      below that observed with inhaled administration. This is a double blind (Sponsor unblind),
      repeat dose, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled study. Study will enrol up to 55
      subjects.

A single dose of study treatment will be based on the size of the subject's hand in order to provide coverage of approximately 2µL/ cm^2. If certain pre-specified criteria for safety and tolerability are met, consideration will be given to decreasing the dose by decreasing the concentration of the topical formulation to 1.15% for the remaining subjects.</description>
