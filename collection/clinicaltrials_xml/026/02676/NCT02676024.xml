  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest is an important public health problem affecting almost
      6000 children a year in the United States. As many as 3% of patients admitted to a
      children's hospital require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Only a minority of children
      survive, of which around 35% go on to have a poor neurological outcome. International
      consensus guidelines on science and treatment recommendations for the management of
      pediatric resuscitation have existed for decades and are revised periodically by the
      International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) based on available evidence. This
      consensus is then used by national councils such as the American Heart Association (AHA) and
      the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada (HSFC) to make guidelines for care. These
      guidelines focus on a structured approach to resuscitation, which emphasizes the rapid
      implementation of key interventions such as starting chest compressions, administering
      epinephrine and defibrillation. The goal of this study is to improve outcomes after cardiac
      arrest in children by improving adherence to consensus guidelines. The investigators aim to
      achieve this by conducting a multi-center, prospective, factorial randomized study with
      participating sites from the International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric
      Innovation, Research and Education (INSPIRE).

      The specific aims of this study are to:

        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge-based cognitive aids, namely the Pediatric
           Advanced Life Support (PALS) algorithm cards, in healthcare teams.

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of teamwork-based cognitive aids, namely the Cognitive
           Aids with Roles Defined (CARD) system, in healthcare teams.

        3. To determine if there is a synergistic effect when adding the CARD system to the use of
           knowledge-based cognitive aids or indeed whether using both these tools together has
           unintended consequences and reduces the added value of each technique.

        4. A secondary aim is to identify whether additional simulation-based team training in the
           use of cognitive aids results in a significant improvement in performance over an
           e-learning module.

      The investigators hypothesize that (i) knowledge-based cognitive aids will significantly
      improve the performance of healthcare teams in providing PALS in a simulated setting, (ii)
      that teamwork-based cognitive aids (CARD) will significantly improve the performance of
      healthcare teams in providing PALS in a simulated setting, and that (iii) adding the CARD
      system to knowledge-based aids will have an added and synergistic effect, (iv) that the team
      performance in all study arms will improve after simulation based training, but that that
      the groups with cognitive aids will continue to out-perform the groups without cognitive
      aids.

    <textblock>
      This study utilizes a prospective, randomized controlled, factorial study design, which
      examines the effect of integrating different elements of cognitive aids for training
      pediatric resuscitation team members. Recruited participants will be asked to perform as
      members of a multi-professional pediatric resuscitation team. The study uses
      simulation-based training as the primary method to evaluate the effect of both knowledge-
      and team-based cognitive aids on team performance, as measured by adherence to PALS
      guidelines. Participants will be teams of multi-professional (physician, registered nurse,
      registered respiratory therapist) resuscitation pediatric healthcare providers. All
      participants will undertake a pre-test scenario, without access to either cognitive aid,
      regardless of group allocation. Participants will then be randomized to one of the four
      study arms using a list generated by an independent statistician. Randomization will be
      stratified by institution so that there are equal numbers of teams in each study arm in each
      participating institution of the multi-center study.

      In study arm 1 (control), resuscitation teams will participate in a simulated pediatric
      cardiac arrest scenario, and provide standard CPR without being provided cognitive aids.
      Participants in this group will be allowed to use any cognitive aid that they happen to keep
      with them and would normally use in their practice, for example, flash cards or smart phone
      apps. In study arm 2 (knowledge-aid), resuscitation teams will participate in the same
      scenario without using the CARD system but will be trained in the use of a knowledge-based
      cognitive aid, which will be used by a dedicated team member (the cognitive aid &quot;reader&quot; or
      &quot;co-pilot&quot;). In study arm 3 (CARD), participants will be trained to use the cognitive aids
      with roles defined (CARD) system but will not be given knowledge-based cognitive aids and
      there will be no dedicated cognitive aid reader in the team. In study arm 4 (integrated
      cognitive aid), participants will be trained to use the CARD system and also in the use of a
      protocol-based cognitive aid, which will be used by a dedicated cognitive aid reader.

      All groups will then undertake a 30-minute e-learning module. E-learning modules will be
      developed to illustrate the principles of crisis resource management using text, images and
      short videos (of simulated scenarios) illustrating high- and low- performance in leadership,
      teamwork and task management. For the control group, the content will focus on team training
      principles and the PALS algorithm. For the knowledge-aid group, the content will also focus
      on team training principles and the PALS algorithm adding an introduction of the principle
      of using the knowledge-based cognitive aids provided with a cognitive aid &quot;reader&quot;
      designated by the team leader who will use a &quot;do-verify&quot; approach to the cognitive aid. For
      the CARD group, the content will also focus on team training principles and the PALS
      algorithm adding an introduction of the principles of the CARD system. For the integrated
      cognitive aid group, the content will focus on team training principles and the PALS
      algorithm adding an introduction of the principles of the CARD system and the principle of
      using the knowledge-based cognitive aids provided with a cognitive aid &quot;reader&quot; designated
      by the team leader who will use a &quot;do-verify&quot; approach to the cognitive aid.

      All participants will then undergo a post-test scenario, with cognitive aids provided as per
      group allocation. All study arms will then undertake 2 simulation-based training scenarios,
      with cognitive aids as per group allocation, followed by a standardized, scripted debriefing
      by an expert facilitator including a focus on how to use any cognitive aids provided, in
      order to delineate the additional effect of simulation-based learning on the e-learning
      module. All groups will then undergo a second post-test scenario, with cognitive aids
      provided as per group allocation. Participants will be asked to complete a demographic
      questionnaire and a questionnaire on the use of cognitive aids.

      In order to standardize scenarios between sites, the investigators will script the content
      of each scenario, including set transitions from one clinical state to another, programmed
      responses to expected interventions, and a pre-set duration. The scenarios will be piloted
      at the main study site and videos circulated to all other sites before piloting at those
      locations.

      Scenario for assessment (pre-test, post-test 1 and post-test 2)

      One 12-minute pediatric cardiac arrest resuscitation scenario will be developed to address
      PALS-based cognitive and clinical performance, as well as compliance with American Heart
      Association guidelines. This scenario has two phases: the first being a non-shockable rhythm
      arrest (six minutes) and the second being a shockable rhythm arrest (six minutes). The case
      history before the arrest and the exact rhythms will be different in each phase to prevent
      over familiarity with the scenarios but the expected management of the arrest is the same in
      each to minimize variations in difficulty of scenario from pre-test to post-test:

        1. Pre-test: myocarditis; asystole/ventricular fibrillation

        2. Post-test 1: respiratory failure; pulse-less electrical activity/ventricular
           fibrillation

        3. Post-test 2: sepsis; pulse-less electrical activity/ventricular tachycardia

      The scenario is designed to test clinical performance during both cardiac arrest algorithms.
      To ensure consistency in delivery of the scenario between recruitment sites, each site will
      be provided with a pre-programmed scenario and a script for the simulation facilitator,
      outlining specifically how to run the scenario, how to introduce the patient, and how/when
      to provide verbal cues to the resuscitation team. During a pre-study run-in phase, each
      recruitment center will have to conduct and transmit 2 successful case scenarios using this
      format to the research coordinating center. This will allow the investigators to confirm
      adequate quality of audiovisual content and sound before the site is allowed to conduct and
      submit data from their site. Videos and data collected during the run-in phase will not be
      analyzed for inclusion in the main study. Participants recruited during this phase will not
      be eligible for inclusion in the study.

      Scenarios for teaching (teaching scenario 1, teaching scenario 2)

      The investigators will use different scenarios for teaching scenario 1 and 2, than for the
      assessment scenarios. The investigators want to ensure that the learning effect seen in the
      post-test is due to either (a) the use of the different cognitive aids, or (b) learning from
      the debriefing after the simulation scenarios and not just familiarity with having done the
      same scenario three times in a row. The investigators acknowledge that in real life there
      are many different clinical scenarios and therefore many appropriate knowledge-based
      cognitive aids. Therefore, the investigators will plan for the knowledge-based cognitive aid
      group and the integrated group to have to select the appropriate cognitive aid for each
      scenario. The scenarios for teaching will be:

        1. Pediatric tachycardia with a pulse and poor perfusion

        2. Pediatric bradycardia with a pulse and poor perfusion

      All recruitment sites will utilize the same make/brand of pediatric simulator for this
      study. The Laerdal SimBaby is widely used across Canada and the Unites States and is capable
      of reproducing physiological responses to medical interventions. This simulator is connected
      to a monitor where vital signs (heart rhythm, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood
      pressure, temperature) are displayed. Through a computer interface, an operator can run
      pre-programmed scenarios where vital signs on the monitor and physical findings on the
      simulator change in real time. The mannequin is capable of producing heart sounds, breath
      sounds and palpable pulses. The simulator can be bag-mask ventilated, the trachea intubated
      and the heart defibrillated. Our cardiac arrest scenario will be pre-programmed into the
      simulator to ensure consistency between recruitment sites and study groups. The
      investigators will ensure as much standardization as possible between centers in the
      physical environment for the scenario, including the same availability and location of
      equipment, including a similar sized room.

      Video rating will be by multiple independent raters with expertise in both simulation and
      pediatric resuscitation, who will be blinded to the research question. Raters will be
      trained in the use of the assessment tools by the primary investigator and co-investigators
      using video conferencing technology. The rater training process will consist of (i) a short
      tutorial on how to use the rating tools, (ii) each rater independently rating similar
      scenarios to those used in the study (which will not be used in the analysis), (iii) a group
      discussion of the ratings led by the principle investigator in order to resolve differences
      and obtain consensus. Approximately 10% of the videos will be rated in duplicate in order to
      establish inter-rater reliability.
