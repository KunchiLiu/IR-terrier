  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being carried out to see if the antiandrogen enzalutamide has antitumour
      effects in early breast cancer.

      Enzalutamide blocks the action of androgens on the androgen receptor (AR) and may slow down
      or stop breast cancers growing. Enzalutamide is approved for the treatment of prostate
      cancer.

      The trial will be offered to patients who have just been diagnosed with early breast cancer
      and who are planned to have surgery in the next few weeks. The treatment will bridge the
      time between the diagnosis and surgery and will be given for 2- 4 weeks. To assess the
      effect of the treatment, small samples of breast cancer tissue will be analysed before the
      start and after treatment. The pre-treatment assessment will be done on archived tissue but
      patients might require an additional biopsy, if sufficient stored tumour tissue is not
      available. The end of treatment samples will be taken during surgery, unless the patient
      will receive medical treatment first instead of surgery which might mean additional biopsies
      of the breast cancer have to be taken. The trial has two cohorts. The cohort of patients
      with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer will test if adding enzalutamide to
      exemestane is better at slowing the growth of breast cancer than exemestane alone. This
      cohort will recruit 141 evaluable post-menopausal patients with a tumour size of at least 1
      cm. The aromatase inhibitor exemestane is approved for the treatment of ER positive breast
      cancer. Blocking aromatase decreases oestrogens but can increase androgens. Enzalutamide is
      therefore added to block the action of androgens on the AR.

      In the second cohort of patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), enzalutamide
      will be given alone to see if it can slow the growth tumours with androgen receptors. As
      only approximately 30% of TNBCs express the AR, a pre screening step will be included to
      test the tumour AR expression, before patients are approached for the ARB trial. The TNBC
      cohort will comprise 55 patients.

                  tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes);

          7. Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of
             a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an IMP, may affect the
             interpretation of the results, render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications or interferes with obtaining informed consent.

          8. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the study protocol.

             trial with any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to study entry.
