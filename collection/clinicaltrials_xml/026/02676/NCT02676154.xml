    <textblock>
      This study will be investigating the effects of fesoterodine on autonomic dysreflexia (AD)
      in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI). The goal of the study is to examine the effect
      of increasing daily use of fesoterodine on episodes of high blood pressure triggered by
      urinary bladder contractions.

      This is a Phase 2, open-label exploratory study investigating the efficacy of fesoterodine
      for treatment of adult patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI) with autonomic dysreflexia
      (AD) triggered by neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO).
