    <textblock>
      Hallux Vagus is a common deformity which affects the first metatarsalphalangeal joint. The
      current diagnostic tool is using X-ray which is expensive and includes radiation exposure.
      The current study is aimed at using the foot pressure platform as an alternative method for
      diagnosis and evaluation of the deformity. The main subjects will be recruited from
      orthopaedic outpatient clinics.

      The recruited subjects will undergo the non-invasive and radiation free study by walking on
      a pressure platform. Then their pressure data will be correlated with their radiological
      study which has already been done in the clinic. The aimed outcome of the study is use the
      foot pressure platform as first line of diagnosis and evaluation of the Hallux Valgus
      deformity.

        Participants will come from an existing list of patients referred to the Foot Pressure
        Analysis Clinic and will include any patients who are diagnosed with HV. They will be
        recruited with the knowledge of the consultant orthopedic surgeons who are the direct care
        providers for these patients. The surgeons will write to eligible participants and include
        a Patient Information sheet about the project (which does not require to record data
        beyond what is normally performed as part of the Foot Pressure Analysis Clinic) If the
        participant is interested in taking part he/she will contact the department.
