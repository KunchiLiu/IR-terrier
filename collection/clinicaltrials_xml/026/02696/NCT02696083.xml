          2. Subject has documented Kellgren-Lawrence radiograph score of 2, 3, or 4. Attempts
             will be made to include at least 3 subjects in each category.

          3. Subject is on a stable analgesic regimen for at least two weeks prior to the
             Screening Visit and anticipates being able to remain on that regimen throughout the

             and/or male partner sterilization).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has documented Kellgren-Lawrence radiograph score of 1.

          2. Subject has undergone viscosupplementation treatment for the knee within 2 months of
             the Screening Visit.

          3. Subject has had a total or partial knee replacement.

          4. Subject has used topical or oral steroids within 2 months of the Screening Visit.

          5. Subject has undergone any anesthetic injection into the knee within 30 days prior to
             the Screening Visit or within 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit for long acting
             lidocaine injection products.

          6. Subject has other diseases of the knee joint including inflammatory arthritis (i.e.,
             rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, gout and pseudogout), autoimmune disease
             (i.e., connective tissue disorders), septic arthritis, previous knee injury or
             intra-articular fracture.

          7. Subject will be unable to treat daily over the course of the 90 day treatment period
             (e.g., travelling without the ability to take Provant).

          8. Subject has received any investigational drug or device within 30 days or 5
             half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer, prior to the Screening Visit or is
             enrolled in another clinical trial.

          9. Subject has a history of a solid tumor that is not in complete remission for greater
             than 2 years other than successfully treated non-metastatic basal cell or squamous
             cell carcinomas of the skin in the treatment area.

         10. Subject has a history of blood cancer (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma).

         11. Subject has an ongoing painful condition, other than osteoarthritis, that in the
             opinion of the investigator might have a confounding influence on the safety or
             effectiveness analyses for this study.

         12. Subject has a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 38 kg/m2.

         13. Subject has a serious psychosocial co-morbidity.

         14. Subject has a history of drug or alcohol abuse within one year prior to screening.

         15. Subject has an implanted pacemaker, defibrillator, neurostimulator, spinal cord
             stimulator, bone stimulator, cochlear implant, or other implanted device with an
             implanted metal lead(s).

         16. Subject is currently pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant prior to Day 90.

         17. Subject is unwilling or unable to follow study instructions, or comply with the
             treatment regimen, study visits, and diary entries.

         18. Subject is in current litigation regarding knee pain or is receiving Worker's
             Compensation.
