      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Provant Therapy System in
      improving localized nerve growth and skin perfusion in subjects with painful peripheral
      diabetic neuropathy of the foot.

      The study is multi-site, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study of the safety and
      efficacy of multi-dose Provant therapy to evaluate neuronal and vascular response in the
      treatment of subjects with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive therapy with an active device or an identical inactive
      sham device. Subjects will treat at home twice daily for 60 days after which they will
      return to the clinic for final evaluations. Subjects will be evaluated at the research
      center for a Baseline/Enrollment visit and again at Day 61 where assessments for safety,
      concomitant medications, Sympathetic Skin Response (SSR), Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV),
      Skin Perfusion Pressures (SPP), and Skin Biopsy will be completed. Subjects will be
      contacted via telephone at Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42 to assess adherence, safety, and
      concomitant medications. Subjects will also complete a Response to Study Device form which
      will capture their daily pain score.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject age is greater than or equal to 22 years and less than 80 years of age.

          2. Subject has documented Type 2 diabetes.

          3. Subject has an HgbA1c &gt; 7% and &lt; 10%.

          4. Subject has peripheral diabetic neuropathy with pain, numbness, tingling, and/or
             burning in at least one foot confirmed by a positive provocative sign and a positive
             Tinel's sign. If both feet are involved, the one with the greatest severity will be
             selected as the index foot.

          5. Subject is in pain Phase 2, 3, or 4 (Appendix C).

          6. Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent and to comply with all
             parts of the study protocol including diary entries.

          7. Female subjects must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile, abstinent, or practicing
             (or agree to practice) an effective method of birth control if they are sexually
             active for the duration of the study. (Effective methods of birth control include
             prescription hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, double-barrier methods,
             and/or male partner sterilization).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has Type 1 diabetes.

          2. Subject is in pain Phase 1 or 5 (Appendix C).

          3. Subject has an active, open ulcer on either lower extremity of arterial, venous or
             mixed disease origin.

          4. Subject has peripheral arterial disease as determined by an Ankle-Brachial Index
             (ABI) of &gt;1.40 or &lt; 0.80. See Appendix E for details on obtaining the ABI.

             NOTE: If the difference in the brachial pulse pressure between the right and left
             arms is &gt; 10 mmHg, the subject will not be eligible for enrollment and will be
             referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation.

          5. Subject has venous insufficiency classified by the Venous Insufficiency
             Classification System (CEAP) of grades C3, C4, C5, or C6. See Appendix F for
             description of the venous insufficiency grading.

          6. Subject has undergone decompression surgery on the index foot to treat peripheral
             neuropathy within 2 years of the Screening Visit.

         15. Subject has a history of malignancy within the past five years other than
             successfully treated non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the

         16. Subject has a serious psychosocial co-morbidity.

         17. Subject has a history of drug or alcohol abuse, as confirmed by urine drug screen,

             stimulator, bone stimulator, cochlear implant, or other implanted device with an
             implanted metal lead(s).

         19. Subject is currently pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant prior to Day 60.
