  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of two commercially-available
      silicone hydrogel contact lenses in normal and low humidity environments after at least 7
      days of wear.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After randomization, subjects will attend a baseline visit to include a 3 hour exposure to
      reduced humidity (RH) environment. The subject's habitual lenses will be worn for the
      baseline visit. This trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must sign an informed consent form;

          -  Adapted, current soft silicone hydrogel daily disposable contact lens wearer during
             the last 2 months;

          -  Prescription within power range of both study contact lenses, as stated in the
             protocol;

          -  Cylinder equal or lower than -0.75 diopter (D) in both eyes;

          -  Willing to wear lenses every day or at least a minimum of 5 days per week, 6 hours
             per day;

          -  Willing to discontinue artificial tears and rewetting drops on the days of study
             visits;

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular anterior segment infection, inflammation, abnormality, or active disease that
             would contraindicate contact lens wear;

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated as determined by the investigator;

          -  Monocular (only 1 eye with functional vision) or fit with only 1 lens;

          -  History of herpetic keratitis, ocular surgery, or irregular cornea;

          -  Pregnant or lactating;

          -  Current AO1D or AO lens wearer;

          -  Other protocol-specified exclusion criteria may apply.
