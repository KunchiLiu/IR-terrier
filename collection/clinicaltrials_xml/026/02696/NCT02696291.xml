  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending dose
      study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of UV-4B oral solution when administered
      to healthy subjects TID for 7 days. Three cohorts of 8 subjects each (6 active, 2 placebo)
      are planned and up to 2 additional cohorts may be added pending safety review of the initial
      cohorts. Safety review will occur after each cohort. Safety is evaluated through Day 15 on
      the basis of adverse event (AE) monitoring, clinical laboratory testing (hematology, serum
      chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), vital signs, physical examinations (PE),
      electrocardiograms (ECG), and fecal occult blood testing. Blood samples are collected at
      specified intervals up to Day 10 for pharmacokinetic assessment.

    <description>Results are recorded in a supine position (for at least 10 minutes) as ventricular heart rate, wave intervals (PR, QRS, QT, QTcF), interpretation (normal; abnormal, not clinically significant; abnormal, clinically significant), and specification of any abnormal result. Triplicate ECGs are collected on Day 1 predose and single ECGs at other time points. Baseline is calculated from the average of the triplicate ECGs on Day 1 predose. If a subject experiences more than one episode of abnormality for the same parameter, the subject is counted only once for the parameter.</description>
