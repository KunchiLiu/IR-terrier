      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common inherited cardiac diseases, with
      a prevalence of âˆ¼0.2%. The disease affects all age groups, with marked clinical
      heterogeneity, ranging from a normal life span without symptoms to poor outcomes such as
      sudden cardiac death (SCD), advanced heart failure, or stroke.

      The investigators' research group determined the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
      in China via epidemiologic investigation was performed in 8080 adults from nine communities
      across nine provinces in China from October 2001 to February 2002, and started to
      investigate the Genotype-phenotype correlations by then. The investigators not only found
      out the hot mutations in Chinese and new related gene which were different from other races,
      but also uncovered the presence of multiple rare variants in sarcomere genes is a risk
      factor for malignant outcomes in HCM. The investigators intent to observe and refining the
      clinical and genetic feature in Chinese patients of HCM and reveal the risk factors for
      prediction model of prognosis.
