      The investigators plan to test an innovative, home-based, short duration, high intensity
      exercise program designed for application in the immediate post-hospitalization period in
      older Veterans. Preliminary data suggest a more intensive approach to physical therapy in
      older adults after hospitalization is safe and maximizes mobility more than usual care. The
      Veterans participating in the high intensity exercise program will receive therapy utilizing
      higher resistance exercises. Outcomes from this group will be compared to data collected
      from the patients receiving standard, lower resistance therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital associated deconditioning is a common and profound contributor to functional
      decline in older adults. Skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy are commonly observed in older
      adults with deconditioning after a hospitalizations, leading to chronic functional deficits.
      This is especially concerning for elderly Veterans, a population who tends to suffer from
      more chronic conditions and have decreased physical function than the general older adult
      population. Therefore, Veterans may be at even higher risk for developing disability in
      activities of daily living after hospitalization and be homebound. Home health physical
      therapy may be the ideal venue for addressing this functional decline as around 3 million
      older adults receive home health services following hospital discharge. These services,
      however, tend to be low intensity and do not appear to adequately address deficits in
      function or performance of home and community mobility. To address these concerns, the
      investigators have developed and tested an innovative, short-duration, home-based, high
      intensity exercise program designed for application immediately following hospitalization.
      This protocol will dose twelve therapy visits over the course of 30 days to determine
      whether visit frontloading has any effect on outcomes. The investigators are using a series
      of high resistance therapy exercises following acute hospitalization to determine if
      progressive high intensity therapy sustainability improves physical function more than
      standard home health physical therapy after an acute hospitalization in older Veterans.
      Outcomes will spotlight physical function, community mobility, Activities of Daily Living,
      quality of life, and cognition.
