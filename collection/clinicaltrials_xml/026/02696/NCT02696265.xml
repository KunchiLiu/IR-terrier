      Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of complex
      fractionated atrial electrocardiograms (CFAEs) guided ablation to pulmonary vein isolation
      based ablation in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).

      Hypothesis: CFAE guided ablation will increase atrial fibrillation free survival compared to
      a PVI guided ablation.

      Patient population: Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation will be randomized based on
      a 2:1 ratio into one of two study arms:

        -  CFAE guided ablation: CFAE mapping and ablation during AF aimed at restoring sinus
           rhythm during ablation, according to methods by Nademanee9. PVI will be checked before
           and after ablation using a mapping catheter

        -  PVI guided ablation: wide antral pulmonary vein isolation during mapping catheter
           control of pulmonary vein signals

      Design: A prospective, multicenter, randomized unblinded clinical study. Objective: The
      purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of complex fractionated atrial
      electrocardiograms (CFAEs) guided ablation to pulmonary vein isolation based ablation in
      patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).

      Hypothesis: CFAE guided ablation will increase atrial fibrillation free survival compared to
      a PVI guided ablation.

      Enrollment: 120 patients will be enrolled in this study in 2:1 CFAE vs PVI group
      randomisation Clinical Sites: International (including non EU-countries), Multicenter study.
      Patient population: Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (defined as atrial
      fibrillation which is sustained beyond 7 days but no more than one year, or lasting less
      than 7 days but necessitating pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, but lasting longer
      than 48 hours) should be documented either on 12-lead ECG, transtelephonic monitoring (TTM),
      ambulatory holter monitoring (HM) or telemetry strip and a physician's note showing
      continuous AF. Furthermore patients who have failed at least one antiarrhythmic drug (AAD)
      (Class I or III) as evidenced by recurrent symptomatic AF or intolerable side effects of the
      AAD.

      Eligible patients who sign the study informed consent form will be randomized based on a 2:1
      ratio into one of two study arms:

        -  CFAE guided ablation: CFAE mapping and ablation during AF aimed at restoring sinus
           rhythm during ablation, according to methods by Nademanee9. PVI will be checked before
           and after ablation using a mapping catheter

        -  PVI guided ablation: wide antral pulmonary vein isolation during mapping catheter
           control of pulmonary vein signals Primary Endpoint: Freedom from recorded atrial
           fibrillation or atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia recurrences (&gt;30 seconds) without
           the use of AADs through 18 months follow-up, post-blanking, on either a 12 lead ECG on
           visits or on 24 hour holter monitoring or on symptom driven event monitoring.

      Additional risks: No additional risks are anticipated for patients enrolled in this study
      compared to patients undergoing ablation of symptomatic AF outside of the study, because the
      same catheter is used as in patients outside the study, and both methods (PVI and CFAE) are
      part of daily practice. Although none reported in the literature so far, CFAE ablation may
      cause more extensive lesions than other ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation,
      especially in the posterior wall. This in turn may cause pericardial effusion, myocardial
      rupture and atrio-esophageal fistula. All of these are potentially life threatening.
      However, energy settings are changed according to myocardial wall size and pressure
      recordings, in order to prevent these complications. Furthermore, also in the group of wide
      antral ablation, the posterior wall is targeted, possibly resulting in the same events. For
      prevention of posterior wall injury, temperature monitoring in the oesofagus may be used.

      Thrombus formation is a complication that can occur with any ablation technique. Thrombi may
      dislodge and embolize, causing a stroke, myocardial infarction or other ischemic event.
      Therefore, it is required that activated clotting time (ACT) is kept above 300 seconds. This
      should be monitored every 30 minutes, and heparin should be administered depending on the
      outcome. The operator is responsible for maintaining an adequate ACT.

      Radiation exposure during the fluoroscopic imaging of the catheters may result in an
      increase in the lifetime risk of developing a fatal malignancy (0.1%) or a genetic defect in
      offspring (0.002%).

      Potential Benefit: The direct benefit for patients undergoing ablation is the potential
      elimination of AF episodes. It is furthermore expected that quality of life will improve and
      less frequent hospitalization will be needed. Whether further morbidity as cerebral vascular
      events are prevented is subject to discussion. The information gained from the conduct of
      this study may benefit patients with AF by improving future treatment modalities.

             malfunction of the lungs or respiratory system that produces chronic symptoms.

         22. Significant congenital anomaly or medical problem that in the opinion of the
             investigator would preclude enrollment in this study.

         23. Women who are pregnant (as evidenced by pregnancy test if pre- menopausal).

         24. Enrollment in an investigational study evaluating another device, biologic, or drug.
