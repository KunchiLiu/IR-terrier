  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of steady state pirfenidone
      on the pharmacokinetics of nintedanib and its metabolites following oral administration of
      2403 mg/day pirfenidone and to investigate the effect of steady state nintedanib on the
      pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone at steady state following oral administration of 150 mg bid
      nintedanib. There will be two cohorts of patients; the first one will consist of patients
      not treated with pirfenidone or nintedanib, while the second one will consist of patients on
      pirfenidone treatment.
