  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm trial of pamrevlumab (FG-3019) to estimate
      pamrevlumab's safety and efficacy in non-ambulatory subjects with DMD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will receive pamrevlumab (35 mg/kg) every two weeks by intravenous infusion for
      at least one year. Subjects may continue on the study for an additional 6 months (for a
      total of a year and a half) if their pulmonary function tests show stabilization or
      improvement in the first 52 weeks of treatment and the FibroGen Medical Monitor approves of
      their continuing. All subjects will be closely monitored for safety. Efficacy assessments
      will be performed routinely over the course of the study.
