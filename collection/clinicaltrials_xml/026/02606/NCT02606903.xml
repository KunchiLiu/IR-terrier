             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator.

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator including gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,
             metabolic, immunological, hormonal disorders or diseases of the central nervous
             system (including but not limited to any kind of seizures or stroke), and other

             than 5 half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication.

          -  Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial.

          -  Previous exposure to a biologic drug.

          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another trial within 2 months prior to intake of
             trial medication in this trial or intake of an investigational drug during the course
             of this trial.

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day).

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking during days of confinement at the trial site.

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because he is considered not able to understand and comply with trial requirements,
             or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the trial.

          -  Subjects with any immunological disorders or auto-immune disorders, (e.g., RA, lupus
