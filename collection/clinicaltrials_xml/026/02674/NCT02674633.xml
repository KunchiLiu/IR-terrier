    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of videogame-like digital therapies on
      attentional functioning and symptoms in children diagnosed with ADHD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, parallel group, controlled trial of two videogame-like
      (iPad-based) digital therapies. The study will consist of 3 primary phases: Screening,
      Washout/Baseline, and Treatment. During the Screening Phase (Day -28 to Day -7),
      participants will undergo screening to evaluate eligibility for the study. Screening may
      take place up to 28 days before the Baseline Visit (Day 0). For those children currently on
      medication for ADHD the Washout period will begin 7 days prior to Baseline where treatment
      will be discontinued. On Day 0, the Baseline visit will occur wherein additional eligibility
      criteria will be established. The Treatment Phase (Day 1 to Day 27) will involve using the
      digital therapy at home for each participant followed by an In-Clinic assessment on Day 28
      to assess key outcomes. Compliance with treatment/use requirements will be monitored
      remotely during this phase.
