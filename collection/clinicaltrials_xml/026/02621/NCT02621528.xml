      The purpose of this multi-center, interventional, prospective, post-market study is to
      collect real world data on patient outcomes and evaluate the procedural success and
      performance of the Lifetech CeraFlex™ occluders for patients with secundum type Atrial
      Septum Defect (ASD), Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) or Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA).

      The Lifetech CeraFlex devices are CE marked and shall be used in this study within its
      intended use as described in the approved corresponding Instructions For Use (IFU).
      Approximately 120 patients will be included in this study. The patient population will
      consist of 40 consecutive patients with a confirmed secundum type ASD, 40 patients with PFO
      and 40 patients with PDA resulting in a significant shunt requiring intervention. This study
      will be conducted in up to 12 investigational centers located in Europe and in the Middle
      East. Subjects will be followed for 12 months post-procedure, with follow-ups as per local
      hospital standard which is expected to be at discharge, between 1 and 3 months, 6 months and
      12 months.
