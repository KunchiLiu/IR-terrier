      1. Sample size：Referring to previous studies and Classic statistics textbook, sample size
           will be 100 cases in each group, half males and half females. Considering Lost losing
           follow-up and exit, the actual sample size will be 120 cases in each group, 30
           cases(15baby boy, 15baby girl) in each hospital.

        2. Data records 2.1 Original records: Subjects' follow-up care cards are original files in
           this clinical trial in duplicate. One copy should be saved in hospital. Original
           records shall be traceable. Each researcher must strictly follow the principle of GCP.
           It must be ensured that he will record any observation and discovery into follow-up
           care card and case report form (CRF).It must be ensured that all data are no
           difference, not getting optional change. When he make any correction, he must not
           change the original record, only add description and explain the reason, correction
           need to be signed and dated.

           Case report form (CRF): In triplicate, it will be de delivered to sponsor, main
           institution of clinical research and participating institution of clinical research
           .Following the principle of GCP, subjects' name should not appear for In order to
           ensure their privacy. Subjects' name must be filled in the initials.

           All of the project will be marked × in □. If some inspection items are not examined for
           some reason, it should be filled in: not examined. If the specific formula dosage is
           unknown, it should be filled in: unknown. When filled in the numbers, it should be
           filled in □. If left side is empty, it should be filled by 0.No null term or missing
           item. Researchers must ensure that all data must be consistent with the original
           record. If digit is not enough, it should be filled on right side. If left side is
           empty, it should be filled by 0.No null term or missing item. Researchers must ensure
           that all data must be consistent with the original record.

           If modifying, he should draw a horizontal line in the middle of the original record
           text, sidenote modified, and then sign the names of the modifier and the date. He must
           not smear or cover original record.

           Data of subjects' guardian: It should be recorded, according to the design and
           definition of observational data table project.

           Extremum principles: The data, deviated significantly or outside the acceptable range
           clinically, must be verified. Clinical doctors must make the necessary instructions.

           Data registration and preservation: Every time after the visit, researchers should
           record the required information into the case report timely. After the end of each
           subjects' observed period, researchers should accurately record relevant information
           formed of data into CRF from original data within 7 days. CRF, informed consent and
           other data should be examined and signed by project leader，then saved into archive
           office of institution. If the problem is found, researcher should Timely deal with it
           and record.

           2.2 Data monitoring Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Evidence-Based Pediatrics
           (CJEBP) will be in charge of data monitoring of the clinical trial. During the trial,
           CJEBP will investigate to 8 research centers for their quality of practice at least
           once, without any announcement. The monitoring objects include doctors, nurses and
           guardians of the objects enrolled in this trial.

           2.2.1 Monitoring to the doctor: the quality of explaining of research to objects'
           guardian and whether they sign the papered notice; Random of distribution; the accurate
           measurement of body length, weight and head-circumference; judgement of gut
           intolerance; record of stool frequency; the pictures of stools and eye secretions.

           2.2.2 Monitoring to the nurses: the accurate of the measuring equipment; the
           correctness of the measuring method; the rightness of data recording (mean of 2
           measurements); the management of trial formula (reception time, check lot number,
           distribution objects, date and signature, recovery objects, date, quantity of formula
           and signature) 2.2.3 Investigator's responsibility: random inspection 1-2 hospitals,
           including whether mixed feeding or mixed with other brand formula; the usage of trial
           formula; regularly follow-up; to take photo of fresh stools and eye secretions.

           2.3 Data management 2.3.1 According to the project of the CRF，administrator will
           establish WeChat client, test and modify this client, and entry data ensuring the
           accuracy of this client. Each researcher in each hospital uploads the measured data to
           administrator by WeChat client on that day when he completes one case observation and
           measurement. In order to ensure the accuracy of the data. Administrator should compare
           data uploaded by WeChat client with original CRF .Subjects' guardians will upload
           photos of stool character and Eye secretion to administrator by WeChat client at 3
           point of follow-up time.

           2.3.2 Generation and correction of doubt, quality control (QC) and database shutdown:
           After completing data input and proofreading, data managers will verify the
           reliability, integrity and accuracy of data in accordance with the requirements of
           clinical trial scheme. If he find lack of content or logic contradiction or fill in
           wrong or uncertainty of data, clinical arbitrator will send it to clinical trial center
           In the form of data question table(DQF).Researchers will answer to questions as soon as
           possible and return it. Data administrator will modify, confirm and correct data
           according to researcher's answer. After solving all of problems, Quality control person
           will check the quality of database according to QC plan. Then he will close the
           database after check clear.

           2.3.3 Data check lock and transmit blindly: Data administrator submit data management
           reports, and request meeting instance about data-check blindly attending by principal
           investigator, statistical analyst, data managers, arbitrator, and sponsors. Checking
           data blindly, signing blindly data-check resolution after meeting, lock in the
           database; locked data will be analyzed by person of statistical analysis.

        3. Statistic analysis 3.1 Analysis sets 3.1.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS): It Includes
           randomly into all group and taken once experimental formula at least and one follow-up
           record at least. The lack of primary outcome endpoint will be evaluated by last
           observation carry forward (LOCF).

           FAS: Crowd used to analysis of primary and secondary efficacy indicators. 3.1.2 Per
           Protocol Set (PPS): It includes all of cases conformed to the trial plan, good
           compliance, not use other formula during the period of trial, completeness in CRF and
           content. The missing cases that treatment time reaches certain time during the period
           of trial can enter into PPS data set. Missing data will be transferred by worst
           observation carried forward (WOCF).After completion of the trial, data set will be
           determined blindly.

           Crowd used to analysis of primary and secondary efficacy indicators. 3.2 statistical
           analysis plan 3.2.1 General principle: All of the statistical test must be two-sided
           test .P&lt;0.05 is considered to be statistically significant difference for all tests.
           Mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, 25% and 75% quintile are used for
           statistical description of measurement data. Count data or level data is described by
           frequency.

           SAS 9.1.3 statistical software is used for statistical analysis. 3.2.2 Analysis of
           missing cases lists the cases into group, falling off and completed. Analysis sets of
           case number, loss rate and comparison between groups should be analyzed by chi square
           test or Fisher's exact probability method.

           3.2.3 Effectiveness evaluation: Normal distribution was tested for measurement index
           (the growth rate of height, body weight and head circumference, stool frequency at the
           end of 4, 8 and 12 weeks after feeding) . If data accord with normal distribution, the
           difference between the experimental group and the control group will be calculated by t
           test, otherwise by t' test. If the data do not conform to the normal distribution, the
           Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used. Test level is a =0.05 (bilateral).

           The count data (constipation and Eye secretions at the end of 4, 8 and 12 weeks after
           feeding) will be expressed as the number of cases and the percentage. If the percentage
           was below 5% or the number of case was less than 30, Fisher exact probability method
           will be used, otherwise chi square test will be used. Test level is a =0.05
           (bilateral).

        4. Quality control Standardized operation procedures should be established in all of
           research process.

      4.1 Qualification of research institution: Research institution must be community health
      service centers qualified for baby healthy check-up.

      4.2 Qualification of researcher: The researchers need GCP training and work under the
      guidance of senior professionals.

      4.3 Test quality control measures: ①Before the start of clinical trials, researchers
      (including paramedics) must receive training for measurement of height, weight and head
      circumference; ②checking measurement bed before measurement; ③researcher must compare scale
      on plastic flexible rule with that on standard steel rule and change plastic flexible if
      error&gt;0.1cm.③The pictures of the feces and eyes will be scored by 2 specialists under the
      condition of unknowing the group. ④The specialist must be responsible for experimental
      formula, counter locked, storage at room temperature away from light. The remaining
      experimental formula will be stored separately, registering number. At the end of trial, the
      remaining experimental formula will be sent back to sponsor.⑤Monitor: Monitor will be
      appointed by sponsor, ensuring subjects' interests during period of trial. Trial record and
      data report must be true, accurate, complete and correct, ensuring that trial must comply
      with both approved plan and Relevant laws.
