      treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis after 3, 7, and 14 days of treatment.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a multicenter (approximately 30 sites), randomized, vehicle-controlled,
      double-blind, and parallel group design. Approximately 264 subjects with moderate to severe
      plaque psoriasis will be randomized to treatment with DFD-06 Cream or Vehicle Cream.
      Subjects will use study product twice daily for 14 days. Subject visits are scheduled at
      Screening, Baseline (Day 1) and Days 4, 8, and 15. Clinical determinations of disease
      severity will be performed using the total sign score (TSS) for the target lesion and
      Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) for overall severity.

             plaque-type psoriasis.

          4. Subject with psoriasis involving 3% or greater BSA, not including the face, scalp,

             urine pregnancy test (test must have a sensitivity of at least 25mIU/ml for human
             chorionic gonadotropin) at the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) and the test result must be
             negative to be eligible for enrollment.

          7. Subject must be in good general health as determined by the investigator and

             therapy, 3) systemic anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil,
             sulfasalazine, 6-thioguanine), or 4) UVB therapy. Inhaled, intraocular, and
             intranasal steroids are allowed.

         10. Use within 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit of: 1) topical antipsoriatic drugs
             (e.g., salicylic acid, anthralin, coal tar, calcipotriene), 2) topical retinoids
             (e.g., tazarotene, tretinoin) or 3) topical corticosteroids.
