      This study will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 given orally
      in combination with intravenous MEDI4736. Secondly, the immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics,
      and preliminary anti-tumour activity will be determined in patients with refractory solid
      tumours

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-center, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics of oral therapy with AZD1775 when combined with a fixed-dose of
      MEDI4736. Immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumour activity in patients
      with refractory solid tumours will also be investigated.

      In the initial design of this study a novel combination of AZD1775 and MEDI4736 was tested.
      The starting dose of AZD1775 was 125 mg BID, over 5 days with 9 days off in 14-day cycles.
      This was designated Schedule A. This dose was not well tolerated. Two of six patients
      experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The protocol was amended to include two additional
      dosing schedules, designated Schedules B and C. In Schedule B patients will receive MEDI4736
      on Day 1, AZD1775 on Day 15-17 and Day 22-24 of a 28-day cycle. In Schedule C, patients will
      receive MEDI4736 on Day 1, AZD1775 on Day 8-10, Day 15-17 and Day 22-24 of a 28-day cycle.
      AZD1775 will be dosed on a maximum of 6 days (Schedule B) or 9 days (Schedule C) in each
      28-day cycle. In both Schedule B and C, dexamethasone will be administered as an anti-emetic
      on the first day of each of the AZD1775 consecutive dosing day blocks and AZD1775 will be
      administered at least 1 week after MEDI4736 administration.

      Three to six patients will be enrolled in dose level 1 of Schedule B and evaluated for
      safety over a 28 day cycle prior to opening Schedule C dose level 1 for enrolment. Following
      safety evaluation of three to six patients in Schedule C dose level 1, a decision will be
      made by the Safety Review Team (SRT) to move forward with one or both schedules for further
      dose escalation. Dose escalation will continue until identification of the Maximum Tolerated
      Dose (MTD). Once the MTD is determined this cohort will be expanded to a total of 18
      patients to collect further safety data and for preliminary assessment of efficacy.
      Alternative dose levels/cohorts and/or schedules may be explored if emerging data suggest
      these would be more appropriate.

      The first day of Cycle 1 in Schedules B and C will be preceded by a seven day lead-in of
      AZD1775 monotherapy to enable serial sampling for assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters.
