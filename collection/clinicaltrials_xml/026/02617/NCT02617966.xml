      Background:

      Retinal diseases cause the loss of rod and cone photoreceptors. Symptoms include vision loss
      and night blindness. Researchers want to learn about rod and cone function in healthy people
      and people with retinal disease. They want to know if how well a person sees in the dark can
      test the severity of retinal disease.

      Objectives:

      To find out if how well a person sees in the dark can test the severity of retinal disease.
      To find out if this can help detect retinal disease and track its changes.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 5 and older with:

      Retinal disease OR

      20/20 vision or better with or without correction in at least one eye

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical and eye history and eye exam. Those with retinal
      disease will also have:

      Eye imaging: Drops dilate the eye and pictures are taken of it.

      Visual field testing: Participants look into a bowl and press a button when they see light.

      Electroretinogram (ERG): An electrode is taped to the forehead. Participants sit in the

      dark with their eyes patched for 30 minutes. Then they get numbing drops and contact

      lenses. Participants watch lights while retina signals are recorded.

      Visit 1 will be 3 8 hours. Participants will have up to 6 more visits over 6 12 months.
      Visits include:

      Eye exam and imaging

      Time course of dark adaptation: Participants view a background light for 5 minutes then

      push a button when they see colored light.

      Dark adapted sensitivity: Participants sit in the dark for 45 minutes. They push a button
      when

      they see colored light.

      For participants with retinal disease, ERG and visual field testing

      Objective:

      The objective of this protocol is to investigate local changes in rod and cone photoreceptor
      function across the retina in healthy volunteers and participants with retinal disease.

      Study Population:

      Up to 80 healthy volunteers and 250 participants, age 5 or older, with retinal disease.

      Design:

      This single-center, observational, case-control study will be comprised of three related
      aims that all make use of a recently released commercial Dark Adapted Chromatic (DAC)
      perimeter. For aim 1 the normal ranges will be established for dark-adapted retinal
      sensitivities to blue and red stimuli of the DAC perimeter. For aim 2, the normal range will
      be established for describing the kinetics of dark adaptation following bleaching of retinal
      rhodopsin for the DAC perimeter. For aim 3, local changes in rod and cone photoreceptor
      function across the retina in participants with retinal disease will be examined from
      measurement of the kinetics of dark adaptation and/or dark-adapted retinal sensitivity to
      the DAC blue and red stimuli.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome for this study is to establish normal ranges for the kinetics of dark
      adaptation (time) and dark adapted retinal sensitivity (dB) for the Medmont DAC blue and red
      stimuli. The secondary outcomes will be to examine changes in the kinetics of dark
      adaptation and dark adapted retinal sensitivity in participants with retinal disease.
