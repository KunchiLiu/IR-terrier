    <textblock>
      The study investigators' aim is to determine the long term safety and efficacy of
      Metreleptin (Myalept,) in promoting amelioration of metabolic abnormalities in patients with
      all forms of partial lipodystrophy. Patients will be offered this protocol under the
      following condition: Subjects have completed University of Michigan research protocol
      MB002-014 and have shown improved clinical benefit as judged by clinical criteria set forth
      in this protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leptin is now an approved therapeutic in the form of Myalept in patients with generalized
      forms of lipodystrophy. However, it is still under investigation for patients with partial
      forms of the disease based on FDA decision on February 24, 2014. The study investigators
      have been carrying out a protocol in patients with partial lipodystrophy, specifically
      familial partial lipodystrophy. There have been a number of patients who have been treated
      under this protocol who are not covered by the currently approved label, but who have
      experienced significant clinical benefit.

      This study would allow continued treatment of patients with partial forms of lipodystrophy
      who volunteered and completed treatment under the investigators' ongoing protocol
      (MB002-014) and who have derived significant clinical benefit as judged by an amelioration
      of their HbA1c, triglyceride levels, and/or reduction in their baseline diabetes or lipid
      therapies that affect quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously completed study protocol:

             o CLINICAL PROTOCOL to investigate the efficacy of recombinant human leptin
             (METRELEPTIN) in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or nonalcoholic fatty liver
             disease (NAFLD) associated with lipodystrophy, MB002-014 (IRMBED: HUM00058708)

          -  Demonstrates clinical benefit as defined by meeting at least one of the following
             criteria upon completion of the above stated protocols:

               -  Reduction of HbA1c ≥ 1.0% or,

               -  Reduction of triglycerides ≥ 30% of baseline or,

               -  Decrease in insulin requirements ≥ 40% or,

               -  Reduction in total NASH score by ≥ 2 points,

               -  Significant worsening of metabolic parameters after discontinuation of
                  Metreleptin if discontinuation has been undertaken.
