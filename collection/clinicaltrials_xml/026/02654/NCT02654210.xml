    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine in what way infections, microbiome, and
      vaccinations during childhood interact in shaping the development of immunity and tolerance.
      The investigators collect and use data from a birth cohort focusing on infectious diseases
      during childhood and apply a life course perspective.

      The goal of the study is to capture the complete history of exposure towards microbial
      challenges in the first six years of life and to study interactions between different
      components of microbial exposure as well as effects on the development of immunity. The
      investigators apply a diary in which parents document symptoms of respiratory and
      gastrointestinal infections of their child, and collect nasal swabs and stool samples
      obtained on first day of symptoms. In addition, the investigators collect nasal swabs and
      stool samples once per year during asymptomatic period. The investigators intend to collect
      venous blood from children participating in the study at the age of six years. In a
      subsample (called intensive subcohort), the investigators collect asymptomatic probes three
      monthly during the first two years of life and obtain venous blood of the children at the
      age of one and two years.

      The intended study sample is 500-1000 participants, with at least 200 participants in the
      intensive subcohort.

      Symptomatic samples will be analyzed by means of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      In addition, the investigators will assess microbial compositions based on next generation
      sequencing and apply multiplex panels to study parameters of unspecific humoral immune
      response. The study will allow to assess homologous and heterologous effects of infections
      and vaccinations measuring specific humoral immune response. In collaboration with
      immunologists, immune phenotypes will be studied and functional tests will be conducted.

      The investigators will use allergic dermatitis at the age of two as a primary proxy outcome
      and target asthma at the age of six years as a definitive clinical endpoint.
