  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mepolizumab is an anti-interleukin-5 ( IL-5) monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-5 and
      reduces eosinophil counts in both sputum and blood. Omalizumab an anti-immunoglobulin E
      (IgE) monoclonal antibody (mAb) is effective in the treatment of moderate to severe allergic
      asthma. The aim of this study is to investigate whether subjects not optimally controlled on
      their current omalizumab treatment, who are eligible for therapy with mepolizumab can be
      effectively and safely switched to treatment with mepolizumab to improve asthma control. The
      study will provide data on the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability of
      mepolizumab when switched directly from omalizumab without any wash-out. The learnings from
      this study may help guide physicians when substituting one biologic with another for the
      treatment of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.

      The study will be a multi-centre, open-label single arm trial. Patients with severe
      eosinophilic asthma who are receiving omalizumab, but are not optimally controlled will be
      eligible to participate. Subjects will remain on their current maintenance therapy including
      omalizumab throughout the run-in period for a minimum of one week and up to 4 weeks. At
      Visit 2 (week 0) subjects will discontinue their omalizumab treatment and be switched to
      mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneous (SC) every 4 weeks for 28 weeks. The treatment period is 32
      weeks, including an Exit Visit/Early Withdrawal Visit, 4 weeks following the subject's last
      dose of mepolizumab.

             cells/microliter (uL) that is related to asthma demonstrated in the past 12 months
             prior to Visit 1 or a peripheral blood eosinophil count of &gt;=150 cells/uL at Visit 1
             that is related to asthma.

          -  Inhaled Corticosteroid: A well-documented requirement for regular treatment with

             levels consistent with menopause (refer to laboratory reference ranges for
             confirmatory levels)]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
             menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective
             contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise,
             they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to
             study enrolment. b) Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options
             listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in
             Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study
             medication and until at least five terminal half-lives or until any continuing
             pharmacologic effect has ended, whichever is longer, after the last dose of study
             medication and completion of the Exit visit/Early Withdrawal visit.The investigator
             is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these
             methods of contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent Respiratory Disease: Presence of a known pre-existing, clinically
             important lung condition other than asthma. This includes current infection,
             bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or diagnoses of
             emphysema or chronic bronchitis (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease other than
             asthma) or a history of lung cancer.

          -  Malignancy: A current malignancy or previous history of cancer in remission for less
             than 12 months prior to screening (subjects that had localized carcinoma of the skin
             which was resected for cure will not be excluded).

          -  Liver disease: Subjects must not be enrolled in the study if :At screening (Visit 1)
             Alanine Transaminase (ALT) &gt;2x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN); and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct

             Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver
             disease per investigator assessment). Stable chronic liver disease should generally

             meets entry criteria.

          -  Cardiovascular: Subjects who have severe or clinically significant cardiovascular
             disease uncontrolled with standard treatment. Including but not limited to: a) known

             in subjects with Bundle Branch Block at screening Visit 1.The QTc is the QT interval
             corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula
             (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or manually over-read. The specific
             formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
             individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other
             words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an
             individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the
             subject from the trial.For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT
             correction formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will be used.

          -  Other Concurrent Medical Conditions: Subjects who have known, pre-existing,
             clinically significant endocrine, autoimmune, metabolic, neurological, renal,

          -  Eosinophilic Diseases: Subjects with other conditions that could lead to elevated
             eosinophils such as Hypereosinophilic Syndromes, including Churg-Strauss Syndrome
             (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis [EGPA]), or Eosinophilic Esophagitis.
             Subjects with a known, pre-existing parasitic infestation within 6 months prior to
             Visit 1 are also to be excluded.

          -  Immunodeficiency: A known immunodeficiency (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus
             [HIV]), other than that explained by the use of corticosteroids taken as therapy for
             asthma.

          -  Other Monoclonal Antibodies: Subjects who have received any monoclonal antibody
             (other than omalizumab) to treat inflammatory disease within 5 half-lives of Visit 1.

          -  Smoking history: Current smokers or former smokers with a smoking history of &gt;=10
             pack years (number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of
             years smoked). A former smoker is defined as a subject who quit smoking at least 6
             months prior to Screening Visit 1.

          -  Alcohol/Substance Abuse: A history (or suspected history) of alcohol misuse or

          -  Hypersensitivity: Subjects with allergy/intolerance to a monoclonal antibody or
             biologic. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components
             thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Investigator opinion: Omalizumab treatment has provided significant clinical benefit
             despite experiencing 2 exacerbations in the past 12 months, and potential benefit
             from a switch to mepolizumab would not outweigh the potential harm after omalizumab
             withdrawal for the subject.

          -  Previous participation: Previously participated in any study with mepolizumab and
             received investigational product (including placebo).

          -  Investigational Medications: Subjects who have received treatment with an
             investigational drug within the past 30 days or five terminal phase half-lives of the
             drug whichever is longer, prior to Screening (V1) (this also includes investigational
             formulations of marketed products).

          -  Pregnancy: Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients should not be
             enrolled if they plan to become pregnant during the time of study participation.
