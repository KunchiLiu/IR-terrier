    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib works in
      treating patients with skin basal cell cancer that has spread to other places in the body or
      cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, blocks tumor
      growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Vismodegib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether
      pembrolizumab is more effective alone or together with vismodegib in treating skin basal
      cell cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of unresectable or metastatic basal cell
      carcinoma (BCC) patients to pembrolizumab monotherapy after disease progression on
      smoothened inhibitor monotherapy.

      II. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to
      pembrolizumab plus vismodegib after partial response or stable disease on smoothened
      inhibitor monotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the nature and severity of adverse events while on pembrolizumab for BCCs.

      II. Determine the nature and severity of adverse events while on pembrolizumab plus
      vismodegib for BCCs.

      III. Determine whether levels of lymphocytic infiltration and programmed cell death ligand
      (PDL)1 are increased after treatment with pembrolizumab, as well as additional search for
      immunologic biomarkers for response such as cluster of differentiation (CD)8 density in
      patients with unresectable or metastatic BCC.

      IV. Determine whether levels of lymphocytic infiltration and PDL1 are increased after
      treatment with pembrolizumab plus vismodegib, as well as additional search for immunologic
      biomarkers for response such as CD8 in patients with unresectable or metastatic BCC.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients experiencing disease progression during previous treatment with vismodegib
      receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses every 21 days for
      24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients achieving partial response or stable disease during previous treatment with
      vismodegib may continue to receive vismodegib orally (PO) on days 1-21 per standard of care
      and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for 24 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 90 days and
      then every 3 months thereafter.
