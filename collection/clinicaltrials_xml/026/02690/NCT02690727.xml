  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open label, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence,
      single dose crossover food effect study in 18 subjects. The subjects will receive the study
      medication under either fed or fast during each treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be conducted in healthy male volunteers. A single oral dose will be
      administered to the subject in each treatment period (under either fasting or fed state).
      Each treatment period will be separated by at least 7 calendar days. Post dose PK blood
      samples will be collected in each treatment period to evaluate the food effect on
      bioavailability of RP6530. The safety and tolerability of single dose will also be
      evaluated.
