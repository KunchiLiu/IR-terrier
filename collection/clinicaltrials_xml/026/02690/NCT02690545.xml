  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by
      bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which
      stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or
      cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with
      cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most
      patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more
      effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted
      against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration.

      In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will
      increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T
      cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma
      cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies
      have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most
      patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of
      floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a
      T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination)
      receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in
      the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.

      The purpose of this research study is to establish a safe dose of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to
      infuse after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and to estimate the number patients whose cancer
      does not progress for two years after ATLCAR.CD30 administration. This study will also look
      at other effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on the patient's cancer.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective (Phase Ib portion of study)

      To establish a safe dose (ie, number cells/m2) of ATLCAR.CD30 to infuse after
      lymphodepletion with bendamustine in patients with CD30+ refractory/relapsed Hodgkin
      lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)

      Primary Objective (Phase II portion of study)

      To estimate 2 year progression free survival (PFS) after administration of ATLCAR.CD30 in
      patients with CD30+ refractory/relapsed HL and NHL

      Secondary Objectives

      To estimate 2 year overall survival (OS) after administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL in
      patients with CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL and NHL

      To estimate the objective response rate as defined by the Lugano Classification for CAR.CD30
      transduced ATL when administered in patients with CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL and NHL

      To estimate duration of response after administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL in patients
      with CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL and NHL

      To further describe the adverse events associated with CAR.CD30 transduced ATL when
      administered in patients with CD30+ relapsed/refractory HL and NHL

      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of bendamustine as a lymphodepleting agent prior to
      infusion of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL

      To measure the survival of ATLCAR.CD30 in vivo

      To measure patient-reported symptom, physical function, and health-related quality of life
      at baseline and over time in patients treated with CAR.CD30 T cells

      Primary Endpoint (Phase Ib)

      Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0).

      Primary Endpoint (Phase II)

      PFS is defined from day of ATLCAR.CD30 infusion to relapse (in patients with a documented
      complete response after conditioning chemotherapy) or progression (in patients without
      complete response after conditioning chemotherapy), or death as a result of any cause per
      the Lugano classification

      Secondary Endpoints

      Overall survival will be measured from the date of administration of CAR.CD30 transduced ATL
      to date of death

      The objective response rate will be defined as the rate of complete responses (CR) + partial
      responses (PR) as determined by the Lugano classification

      The duration of response will be defined as time from documentation of tumor response to
      disease progression

      Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.0)

      Persistence of CAR.CD30 T cells in vivo will be determined by quantitative PCR and flow
      cytometry in peripheral blood samples

      Patient reported symptoms will be measured using selected symptoms from the NCI PRO-CTCAE.

      OUTLINE

      Cell Procurement

      Up to 100 mL per collection (up to 3 collections) of peripheral blood will be obtained from
      patients for cell procurement. In patients with low (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry
      less than 200/Î¼l) T-cell count in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to
      isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes.

      ATLCAR.CD30 Cells Administration

      ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be administered as described below 1-4 days (preferably 1-2 days)
      after lymphodepletion with bendamustine. ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be given by a licensed
      provider (oncology nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 1-10 minutes through
      either a peripheral or a central line. The expected volume will be 1-50cc. Patients with a
      partial response or stable disease at 6 weeks may receive a second infusion of ATLCAR.CD30
      if cells are available. Note: Lymphodepletion with bendamustine will occur for two
      consecutive days and will not be given prior to a second infusion of cells (if applicable).

      Duration of Therapy

      Therapy in LCCC 1532 involves 1-2 infusions of ATLCAR.CD30 cells. Treatment with one
      infusion will be administered unless:

        -  Patient decides to withdraw from study treatment, OR

        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

      Duration of Follow-up

      Patients will be followed for up to 15 years for Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR)
      evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for
      unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the
      adverse event.

    <description>Phase Ib: Two doses will be investigated 1x10^8 cells/m2 and 2x10^8 cells/m^2. The study team plans to use the 3+3 design. If there are no DLT in first 3 patients, the study team will go up to the dose of 2 x 10^8 cells/m2. If there is toxicity in 1/3 patients in the initial cohort, the study team would expand to enroll up to 6 patients. If there are dose limiting toxicities (DLT) at the dose of 2 x 10^8 cells/m^2, the study team will initially decrease the dose to an intermediate dose of 1.5 x 10^8 cells/m^.
Phase II: The study team planning to enroll 25 patients to contribute data. Sequential boundary will be used to monitor DLT rate.</description>
