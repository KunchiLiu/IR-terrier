  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      U3-1784 is a human monoclonal antibody specifically raised against the Fibroblast Growth
      Factor Receptor 4 (FGFR4). The purpose of this study is to assess safety and tolerability of
      U3-1784, an FGFR4 human monoclonal antibody, in advanced tumour and HCC patients. The study
      is designed to identify a safe and tolerated dose in advanced tumour patients using a 3+3
      dosing. The selected dose will then be used to assess safety and tolerability in HCC
      patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Part 1: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid
             tumours refractory to, intolerant of, or not eligible for standard treatment, or who
             decline standard therapy, or for whom no therapy with curative intent is available

          -  Part 2: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed HCC refractory to,
             intolerant of, or not eligible for standard treatment, or who decline standard
             therapy, or for whom no therapy with curative intent is available. If emerging Part 1
             data suggest that a particular tumour type or specific tumour histology might be
             responsive to treatment, then patients with this tumour type or histology will also
             be included in Part 2 of the study.

          -  Male or female patients, 18 years of age or older.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to initiation of treatment.

          -  Males and females of childbearing potential are permitted in the study so long as

             throughout the study and for up to 90 days after completion. Highly effective methods
             of contraception include: hormonal methods associated with inhibition of ovulation,
             intrauterine device; surgical sterilization (including partner's vasectomy) or sexual
             abstinence, if this is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Women of
