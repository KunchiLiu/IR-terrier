    <textblock>
      Newly diagnosed glioblastoma subjects who are eligible will be enrolled following surgery to
      remove the brain tumor. They will then undergo a leukapheresis to harvest cells for the
      generation of the study drug, Epidermal Growth Factor variant III Chimeric Antigen Receptor
      (EGFRvIII CAR) T cells prior to beginning standard of care (SOC) radiation therapy (RT) with
      temozolomide (TMZ). Once SOC RT with TMZ is completed, subjects will return for the post-RT
      brain imaging assessment, and if stable will start post-RT TMZ cycles. During the 3rd cycle
      of post-RT TMZ, the EGFRvIII CAR T cells will be infused in dose escalation cohorts.
      Following a one month delay between cycles, the subject will resume post-RT cycles of TMZ
      and be monitored with blood work and brain imaging as per SOC. Once the maximally tolerated
      dose (MTD) is reached in the dose escalation cohorts, an expanded cohort of 12 subjects will
      be enrolled to obtain a more precise estimate of the probability of unacceptable toxicity
      and to track the EGFRvIII CAR T cells using 111 Indium (111In) labeling. Computed Tomography
      (CT) will be done on days 1, 5, and 10 post-infusion to determine intracerebral (IC)
      localization.

      Following consent, subjects will be enrolled onto dose-escalation cohorts. Patients will
      undergo leukapheresis to harvest Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) for the
      generation of EGFRvIII CAR T cells prior to beginning RT and concurrent TMZ. T cells will be
      isolated from the patient's PBMCs and transduced to express S. Briefly, PBMC will be
      stimulated with Muromonab-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) (OKT3), an anti-CD3 monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) and transduced on RetroNectin® coated plates. Transduced cells will be
      expanded in interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 14 days.

      Patients will then complete 6 weeks of standard of care RT and concurrent TMZ at a targeted
      dose of 75 mg/m^2/d. Patients who experience progressive disease during radiation, who are
      unable to tolerate TMZ, or who require TMZ dose modification will be withdrawn from the
      study and replaced.

      The remaining patients will then receive the initial cycle of TMZ at 50-100 mg/m^2/day for
      21 days, followed by 2 more cycles of 100 mg/m^2/day for 21 days every 28 days, which is the
      standard dose-intensified (DI) TMZ regimen. If the patient is unable to tolerate DI TMZ or
      the CAR-specific T cells do not meet release criteria, the patient will be withdrawn before
      CAR treatment and replaced.

      On day 22 (+3 day window) of the third post-radiation cycle of DI TMZ, the total dose of
      EGFRvIII CAR T cells will be delivered intravenously. If sufficient CAR-specific T cells
      cannot be generated to meet the targeted assigned dose within the dose-escalation portion of
      the study, the patient will be treated at a lower pre-defined dose level using available
      CAR-specific T cells and replaced in the assigned higher dose. The administered dose will be
      the highest defined dose level for which there are sufficient CAR-specific T cells
      available. Within the expanded cohort, if sufficient CAR-specific T cells can't be generated
      to meet the MTD dose, all available T cells will be administered.

      Following the infusion of EGFRvIII CARs, blood samples for immune monitoring will be drawn
      1, 5, and 10 days after the infusion, then 1, 3, and 6 months, then yearly until progression
      (or death or lost to contact). The return visits for immune monitoring at the 3, 6, and
      yearly will coincide with standard of care clinic visits. Blood will also be taken for
      Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) per the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) at 3, 6 and 12 months during standard of care clinic visits. Lastly,
      blood for evaluation of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) will be drawn prior to cell
      infusion, 1 and 4 hours after infusion, and on days 1, 2, 5, 10, and at one month.
      Measurements for CRS include IL-2, IL-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα), interferon
      (IFN) gamma, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and C-reactive
      protein (CRP).

      Patients will return to clinic one month following the EGFRvIII CAR T cell infusion to be
      evaluated for cycles of standard of care 5-day TMZ at 150-200 mg/m^2/day for the first 5-day
      cycle, followed by 200 mg/m^2/day for 5-days every 28 days per the treating oncologist. This
      will result in a 28-day delay between TMZ cycles 3 and 4 in order to decrease the chance of
      study drug washout from TMZ.

      Tumor progression will be documented histologically, unless there are clinical
      contraindications, to exclude inflammatory responses presenting as radiographic or clinical
      changes, which could indicate a potentially toxic or therapeutic responses and not tumor
      progression. If tissue is obtained through Tissue Bank Consent Institutional Review Board
      (IRB) # 2635, it will be used to confirm tumor progression histologically, and to assess
      immunologic cell infiltration and EGFRvIII antigen escape at the tumor site. Patients will
      be eligible for additional adjuvant therapy at the time of tumor progression.

      A classical &quot;3+3&quot; study design will be used to estimate the MTD for CAR-specific T cells
      treatment among patients with newly-diagnosed GBM. Four dose levels will be considered: #1:
      4.5 x 10^6/kg, #2: 1.5 x 10^7/kg, #3: 4.5 x 10^7/kg, and #4: 1.5 x 10^8/kg.Starting with the
      lowest dose level, cohorts of 3-6 subjects will be accrued at each dose level. If a patient
      is lost to follow-up during the first 4 weeks after CAR treatment without experiencing a
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), then the patient will not be evaluable for the determination
      of DLT and will be replaced. The MTD is the highest dose level at which ≤1 of 6 patients
      experiences DLT during the 4 week observation period after CAR treatment.

      An expanded cohort of a total of 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD of EGFRvIII CAR T
      cells in order to obtain a more precise estimate of the probability of unacceptable
      toxicity. This cohort will also have the cells radiolabeled with 111In to track their
      distribution. Briefly, CARs will be counted and re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline
      (PBS). 4-6x10^8 cells will be labeled with 500 microCi of 111In. The cells will be washed
      and mixed with cold CARs to achieve the desired cell dose. The labeled CARs will be infused
      into the patient through an intravenous catheter within the Ambulatory Bone Marrow
      Transplant (BMT) Unit. Distribution of 111In-labeled EGFRvIII CARs will be evaluated at 1, 5
      and 10 days post-infusion using scintigraphy.

    <description>The name of the drug is CAR gene-modified T cells or abbreviated as EGFRvIII CARs. The class of action is a biological and the mechanism of action is cytotoxicity. The drug substance is autologous T cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding for a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) directed against the tumor specific antigen, EGFRvIII. EGFRvIII CARs are genetically engineered T cells that have been taken from patients with GBM ex vivo to express a CAR recognizing the GBM tumor-specific antigen EGFRvIII, which is expressed on a subset of GBMs but not in normal human tissues with the aim of mediating regression of their tumors. Patients' CARs will be radiolabeled with 111In for correlative studies in the expanded cohort.</description>
