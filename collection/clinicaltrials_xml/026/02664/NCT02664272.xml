          -  Advanced hip joint wear due to degenerative, post-traumatic or rheumatoid arthritis

          -  Fracture or avascular necrosis of the femoral head

          -  Follow-on conditions after previous surgery such as osteosynthesis, joint
             reconstruction, arthrodesis, hemiarthroplasty or total hip replacement.
