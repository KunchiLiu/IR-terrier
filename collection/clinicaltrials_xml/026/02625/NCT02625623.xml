    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from date of randomization until PD or death, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from date of randomization until date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, whichever occurs first. PFS will be assessed as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of longest diameter (SLD), taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response (BOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from date of randomization up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>BOR will be determined according to RECIST 1.1 and as adjudicated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC). BOR is defined as the best response of any of the complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) recorded from the date of randomization until disease progression or recurrence (taking the smallest measurement recorded since the start of treatment as reference). CR: Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. PR: At least 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of all lesions. Stable disease (SD)=Neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in European Quality Of Life 5-dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) Health Outcome Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 20 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L Health Outcome Questionnaire is a measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The EQ-5D-5L defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The 5 items are combined to generate health profiles. These profiles were converted to a continuous single index score using a one to one matching. The lowest possible score is -0.59 (unable to walk, unable to self-care, unable to do usual activities, extreme pain or discomfort, extreme anxiety or depression) and the highest is 1.00 (no problems in all 5 dimensions).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 20 months</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-question tool used to assess the overall quality of life (QoL) in cancer subjects. It consists of 15 domains: 1 global health status (GHS) scale, 5 functional scales (Physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), and 9 symptom scales/items (Fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial impact. The EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL score ranges from 0 to 100; High score indicates better GHS/QoL. Score 0 represents: very poor physical condition and QoL. Score 100 represents: excellent overall physical condition and QoL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Stomach Cancer Specific (EORTC STO22) Questionnaire Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 20 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-STO22 is a gastric cancer quality of life questionnaire. There are 22 questions concerning disease, treatment related symptoms, side effects, dysphagia, nutritional aspects, and questions about the emotional problems of gastric cancer (dysphagia, pain, reflux, eating restrictions, anxiety, dry mouth, body image, and hair loss). For the symptom scales or single items, participants will be assessed using a 4-point scale (1=not at all; 2=a little; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). All scales and single-item scores ranged from 0 to 100. For the symptom scales or single items, a higher score indicated a high level of symptoms and problems, i.e. 0=no symptoms, 100=most severe symptoms.</description>
