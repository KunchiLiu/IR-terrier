      This is a multi-site, dispensing, 4-visit, 2-arm parallel group, randomized, double-masked
      clinical trial using a Vistakon investigational contact lens (test) and a marketed monthly
      replacement contact lens (control). Each subject will be assigned randomly to either the
      test or control lens to evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of the investigational
      contact lens compared to the marketed contact lens over a period of six months of lens wear.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          -  The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          -  The subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in
             the range of -1.00 to -6.00 in each eye.

          -  The subject's refractive cylinder must be ≤ 1.00 Diopters (D) in each eye.

          -  The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye.

          -  The subject should own a wearable pair of spectacles and bring to initial visit.

          -  The subject must be an adapted frequent replacement daily wear spherical silicone
             hydrogel soft contact lens wearer in both eyes.

          -  The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

          -  The subject must have enrolled and completed all visits in clinical study CR-5726.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will
             be discontinued).

          -  Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere
             with contact lens wear. This may include, but not be limited to, diabetes,
             hyperthyroidism, recurrent herpes simplex/zoster, Sjögren's syndrome, xerophthalmia,
             acne rosacea, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and immunosuppressive diseases or any
             infectious diseases (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis).

          -  Use of any of the following medications within 1 week prior to enrollment: oral
             retinoid isotretinoin (e.g., Accutane), oral tetracyclines, topical scopolamine, oral
             phenothiazines (e.g. Haldol, Mellaril, Thorazine, Elavil, Pamelor, Compazine), oral
             and ophthalmic Beta-adrenergic blockers (e.g., Propranolol, Timolol, and Practolol),
             systemic steroids, and any prescribed or OTC ocular medication.

          -  Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion.

          -  Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
             photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK),
             etc.)

          -  Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to Opti-Free® PureMoist® multipurpose
             care solution or Eye-Cept rewetting drop solution

          -  Any ocular infection, allergy or clinically significant ocular disease (e.g., corneal
             edema, uveitis, severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca, ocular hypertension), or ocular
             conditions (e.g. strabismus), which might interfere with the study.

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          -  Daily disposables, extended wear, monovision or multi-focal contact lens correction.

          -  History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus.

          -  Employee or relative of employees of sponsor or investigational clinic (e.g.,
             Investigator, Coordinator, Technician)
