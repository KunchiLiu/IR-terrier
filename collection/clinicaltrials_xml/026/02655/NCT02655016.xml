  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled (2:1 niraparib:placebo) study
      in patients with Stage III or IV ovarian cancer. Patients must have completed front-line
      platinum based regimen with a physician-assessed response of Complete Response (CR) or
      Partial Response (PR). Stage III patients must have visual evidence of disease.
      Additionally, patients must have a normal or &gt;90% decrease in cancer antigen 125 (CA-125)
      following front-line platinum treatment. The study will assess the efficacy of niraparib as
      maintenance treatment, as measured by PFS.
