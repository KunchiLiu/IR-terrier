  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether improvement in P50 (a pharmacodynamic
      marker) in auditory sensory gating is demonstrated after administration of TAK-058 and
      ondansetron compared to placebo in participants with schizophrenia.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-058. TAK-058 is being tested to evaluate
      its effects on P50 auditory gating in people who have stable schizophrenia. This study will
      look at the effect of TAK-058 on P50 auditory gaiting of people with schizophrenia.

      This study will be performed in a sequential manner progressing from an optimization
      (screening) phase in healthy volunteers, to screening of subjects with schizophrenia in part
      1, to a 3 period crossover treatment phase in part 2. In the screening phase, 15 healthy
      volunteers will be enrolled to optimize the settings for the measurement of
      neurophysiological markers prior to any dosing in participants with schizophrenia. If
      optimization is not reached, the study will be terminated. In part 1 participants with
      schizophrenia will receive 2 P50 electroencephalography (EEG) sessions. A measurable deficit
      in auditory P50 gating S2/S1 ratio greater than (&gt;) 0.5 will be established during this
      phase. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be calculated for the P50 auditory
      gating S2/S1 ratios collected during the 2 sessions. If these P50 auditory gating S2/S1
      ratio measurements are found to have at least a fair level of agreement within individuals
      (that is, ICC &gt; 0.5), part 2 of the study will begin. 12 participants demonstrating P50
      impairment in part 1, will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of
      the six treatment crossover sequences â€”which will remain undisclosed to the patient and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Placebo + TAK-058 + Ondansetron

        -  TAK-058 + Placebo + Ondansetron

        -  Ondansetron + Placebo + TAK-058

        -  Placebo + Ondansetron + TAK-058

        -  TAK-058 + Ondansetron + Placebo

        -  Ondansetron + TAK-058 + Placebo

      All participants will be asked to take one dose of capsule, followed 1 hour later by one
      dose of solution on Day 1 of each intervention period.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately118 days. Participants will make be confined to
      the clinic for 3 days (Day -1 through Day 2 of each period), a final visit for schizophrenic
      participants in Part 2 after receiving TAK-058, on Day 2 of Period 3 (no final visit for
      optimization phase healthy participants), and a telephonic follow up assessment 21 days
      after last dose of study drug.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in P50 Ratio (Stimulus [S]2/S1) at Central (Cz) Electrode Following Administration of TAK-058</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 pre-dose and at multiple time points (up to 2 hours) in each period of Part 2 post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be checked for P50 gating ratio. Stimulus signal of 90 decibel pulses of 0.1 millisecond (msec) will be generated and recorded the event-related potential waveforms. 32 pairs of auditory clicks will be presented every 10 seconds, with a 500 ms interclick interval. S1 is defined as the conditioning P50 wave with the most positive peak between 30 and 90 ms after the conditioning stimulus. S2 is defined as the test P50 wave with the positive peak after the test stimulus that was closest in latency to the conditioning P50. Amplitude is the difference between the positive peak and the preceding negative trough for both waves. The data from the vertex (Cz site) is to be collected and the P50 gating ratio (S2/S1) is calculated as the ratio of the test P50 amplitude to the conditioning P50 amplitude.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Experience at Least one Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of Period 1 of Part 2, up to 21 days after last dose of study drug in Part 2</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
