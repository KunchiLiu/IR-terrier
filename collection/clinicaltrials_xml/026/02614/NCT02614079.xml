  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to objectively evaluate the success of a spinal cord stimulator (SCS) trial
      using testing (DSSEP) to determine if the paresthesia (tingling sensation) or pain reduction
      achieved correlates with the degree of stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SCS trial leads will be placed as per standard of care, using fluoroscopic guidance and
      leads will be checked for proper positioning. Leads will be tested for appropriate
      paresthesia coverage of the patient's painful area(s), using multiple electrode
      configurations and lead positions (dependent on the location of the pain). After the leads
      are secured, the patient will be sent to the recovery room where the DSSEP test will be
      performed. A technologist will glue/tape recording electrodes to the patient's head, neck,
      back or legs. One or two stimulating electrodes are also placed on the patient's leg. Each
      electrode is checked with a meter to ensure proper functioning. Pulsing stimulus will start
      in one of the stimulating electrodes. Each time a different area is tested, the pulsing will
      be started again. Each area tested will take 10-15 minutes. The painful dermatomal
      distribution area, specific to each patient will be used for dermatomal SSEP stimulation.
      Placement will be correlated with nerve roots involved with the corresponding dermatomes.
      Measurements will be obtained to determine collision criteria.

    <description>Positive collision: 75% or greater decrease in amplitude from the baseline waveform; moderate collision: 40-74% decrease in amplitude from the baseline waveform; poor or no collision: less than 40% decrease in amplitude from the baseline waveform. CPz (centroparietal)-Fpz (popliteal fossa) cortical montage (images) will be used as primary montage to evaluate collision results.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all the following criteria
        apply:

        A. Subject understands the procedures, agrees to participate in the study, and has signed
        and dated the informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study-related
        activities.

        B. Subjects are male or female greater than 18 years old at the time of screening visit.

        C. Pain in one or both lower extremities. D. Pain is not responding to conservative
        treatment such as physical therapy or medications.

        E. Average pain rating of at least 4 on a scale 0 to 10, on average, prior to enrollment
        in the study.

        F. Patient is mentally competent to make decisions.

        Exclusion Criteria

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following
        criteria apply:

        A. Female subject with childbearing potential (a premenopausal female, who is not
        surgically sterile).

        B. Subjects who poorly cooperate or have any cognitive impairment. C. Patient with severe
        concomitant depression. D. Inability to communicate adequately with physician and /or
        study coordinator.

        E. Patient is diagnosed with a psychiatric condition that will likely interfere with
        diagnostic accuracy of the workup protocol or with recovery following the anticipated
        procedure
