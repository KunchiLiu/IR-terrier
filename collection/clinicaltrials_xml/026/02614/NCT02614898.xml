    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label study with no patient randomization. Treatment for
      atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) will remain observational and at the discretion of
      the treating physician. The purpose of this study is to assess disease manifestations of
      complement mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and potential clinical predictors of
      disease manifestations and progression in patients with aHUS with or without eculizumab
      treatment in the clinical setting.
