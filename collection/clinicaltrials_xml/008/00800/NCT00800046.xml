    <textblock>
      Prospective single-arm study of the GDS Accucinch® System in the treatment of mitral valve
      regurgitation through subvalvular mitral repair.

      Purpose: To demonstrate the safety, feasibility and potential efficacy of using the GDS
      Accucinch System to reduce mitral valve regurgitation through subvalvular mitral repair.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with mitral regurgitation grade of ≥ 2+ (Germany) and ≥ 3+(Canada)

          -  Ejection Fraction ≥ 30%

          -  Patient is eligible for surgical mitral valve repair or replacement

          -  Confirmation by the Medical Monitor that patient has met all eligibility criteria and
             no exclusion criterion

          -  The patient has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions,
             and has provided written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Myocardial infarction within 90 days of the intended treatment with the device

          -  Prior surgical, transcatheter, or percutaneous mitral valve intervention

          -  Any intervention for coronary artery disease (CAD) within the last 3 months prior to
             treatment, or known requirement for revascularization within the next 12 months

          -  Hemodynamic instability or the need for emergent surgery

          -  NYHA Class IV symptoms of heart failure

          -  History of bacterial endocarditis

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          -  History of stroke within the prior 6 months

          -  Any angiographic or clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the
             patient at increased risk with the placement of the device or concurrent medical
             condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months

          -  Co-morbid conditions that place the subject at an unacceptable surgical risk or any
             contraindication to mitral valve surgery

          -  Subjects require concomitant cardiac surgical repair such as other mitral repair
             techniques, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), aortic valve replacement, tricuspid
             repair or replacement, left ventricular remodeling surgery and congenital repair

          -  Female patients who are pregnant, of child bearing potential or lactating

          -  Patients who are unable or unwilling to comply with the follow-up schedule
