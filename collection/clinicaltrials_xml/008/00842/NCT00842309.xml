      The purpose of the study is to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
      D-cycloserine (DCS) augmentation of behavior therapy in individuals with Body Dysmorphic
      Disorder (BDD). Specifically, we intend to randomize 50 individuals with BDD to receive
      either DCS (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25) one hour prior to 8 of 10 behavior therapy sessions.

      This treatment study also provides us with the opportunity to further explore the molecular
      genetics of BDD, as well as the genetic predictors of response to an extinction-based
      treatment. We will take a hypothesis-driven approach by focusing on genes and systems
      previously shown to mediate fear acquisition and NMDA-dependent extinction learning
      including NMDA-related glutamatergic loci (GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, DAAO, DAOA) and three
      other genes strongly implicated in fear extinction (BDNF, NTRK2, CNR1). Other loci of
      interest in the molecular genetics of BDD include: the serotonin transporter gene, dopamine,
      GABA-A, and cytochrome P450 genes.

          -  Primary diagnosis of Body Dysmorphic Disorder as determined by DSM-IV criteria

          -  BDD Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score greater than or equal to 24

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urinary beta-HCG test

          -  Subjects currently taking psychotropic medication must be on a stable does for at
             least two months prior to initiating study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women will be excluded

          -  People taking medications that may interfere with DCS

          -  History of seizure disorder or other serious medical illnesses such as

             disease

          -  Comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (alcohol dependence, bipolar disorder, psychosis,

             pethidine, and the following antibiotics in high dosage: penicillins, cephalosporins,
             amphotericin, and imipenem

          -  Those deemed to pose a serious suicidal or homicidal threat will be excluded

          -  Current psychotherapy or failure to benefit from ten or more sessions of previous ERP
             treatment is a rule-out
