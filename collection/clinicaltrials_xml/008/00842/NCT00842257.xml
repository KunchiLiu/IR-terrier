  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether panitumumab helps treat colorectal
      cancer in participants who have not responded to treatment with cetuximab. Panitumumab is a
      human monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are proteins that recognize a foreign substance in the
      body and then attach themselves to it making it exposed to destruction. Panitumumab attaches
      itself to a protein on cancer cells called &quot;epidermal growth factor receptor&quot; or EGFR. EGFR
      helps cancer cells to grow, and blocking EGFR helps prevent cancer cells from growing.

      -  Panitumumab will be given to the participants through a central line. A central line is
           a long, thin tube (catheter) that is inserted through the skin into a large vein in the
           chest. This is placed by a radiologist or surgeon.

        -  Panitumumab will be given in 4-week cycles. Panitumumab infusions will be given on days
           1 and 15 of each cycle (every 2 weeks).

        -  The following procedures will be performed on days 1 and 15 of each cycle, before each
           infusion: physical exam; questions about any symptoms or side effects; performance
           status; routine blood tests and CT or MRI (every 2 cycles).

        -  Participants can continue to receive panitumumab until their disease gets worse or they
           experience unacceptable side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma and
             measurable disease by RECIST criteria on CT or MRI

          -  Treated with cetuximab as part of their last treatment regimen for at least 4 weeks
             and must have been taken off cetuximab therapy for disease progression. Patients may
             or may not have been treated with 5-FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab.
             There is no maximal number of pre-existing treatment regimens. At least 2 weeks must
             have elapsed between previous anticancer therapy and the start of treatment on
             protocol, AND resolution of any skin rash related to prior treatment with epidermal
             growth factor receptor inhibitor

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0, 1 or 2

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Normal organ, metabolic, and marrow function as defined in the protocol

          -  A wild-type tumor K-RAS gene as determined by sanger sequencing of exon 2 from tumor
             DNA

          -  18 years of age or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of untreated and or progression central nervous system metastases

          -  History of another primary cancer except: curatively treated in situ cervical cancer
             or breast; curatively resected non-melanoma skin cancer; other primary solid tumor
             curatively treated with no known active disease present and no treatment administered
             for 3 years or more prior to enrollment

          -  Intolerance to cetuximab leading to drug discontinuation due to rash, GI toxicity, or
             other grade 3 or 4 toxicities

          -  Radiotherapy &lt; 14 days prior to enrollment

          -  Systemic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, or experimental or approved
             proteins/antibodies &lt; 14 days before enrollment

          -  Subjects requiring chronic use of immunosuppressive agents

          -  Any investigational agent or therapy 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             any study requirements
