      The purpose of this study is to determine if Plexur P grows bone in the iliac crest (where
      bone was removed or &quot;harvested&quot;) for the back surgery.

      The study will be focusing on patients who require back surgery. Often additional bone is
      required from the hip of the patient (iliac crest). When bone removed from the hip, a &quot;void&quot;
      is often created. This &quot;void&quot; will be filled in with Osteotech's Plexur P product.

      This prospective trial is designed to evaluate the ability of the Plexur P device (bone void
      filler) to reconstitute the iliac crest in patients requiring iliac crest bone harvesting
      procedures at one single study site.

      Plexur P Bone Void Filler is:

        -  A biocomposite of mineralized cortical allograft bone fibers and
           polylactide-co-glycolide co-polymer.

        -  Designed to fill bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system that are not intrinsic to
           the stability of the bony structure.

        -  Porosity is introduced into the Plexur P Biocomposites to create a cancellous-like
           structure that provides a scaffold for bone growth.

      In addition:

        -  Patients will be screened for study eligibility based on the need for iliac crest bone
           harvesting.

        -  Fifteen (15) eligible patients will be enrolled and will have an iliac crest harvesting
           defect backfilled with Plexur P to repair the iliac crest defect.

        -  As a part of routine follow up care, patient related outcomes including measurements of
           pain severity and pain relief will be determined using patient (IRB approved)
           questionnaires.

        -  Radiographic analysis will also be used to determine amount of bony ingrowth of the
           Plexur P device.
