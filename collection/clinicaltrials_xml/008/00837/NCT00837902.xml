  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to determine the genetic factors contributing to
      interindividual differences in response to beta-blockade.

  <detailed_description>

      The Aim is to define the contribution of genetic variation to the interindividual
      variability in response to β-blockade. The rationale for the study is as follows:
      Beta-blockers prevent the activation of β-ARs and thus form the cornerstone of treatment of
      pathological states such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease. Functional
      polymorphisms in cardiac beta-receptors have been shown to determine response to β-blocker
      therapy. A physiologic stimulus such as exercise causes sympathetic stimulation and
      activation of the cardiac β-ARs and genotypic differences in response to β-blockers are
      magnified under states of heightened sympathetic activity. Thus, in addition to measuring
      the response to β-blockers at rest, we will also determine the response to β-blockade after
      sub-maximal exercise on a supine bicycle ergometer. Genetic variations that may alter
      sensitivity to a beta blocker will be sought.
