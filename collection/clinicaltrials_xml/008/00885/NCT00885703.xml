  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal
      cord, caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. CM most often affects people with
      compromised immune systems, like those with advanced HIV infection. This study will explore
      the safety, tolerability, and therapeutic effect of a new treatment regimen with high-dose
      fluconazole for management of CM in HIV-infected patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CM is the most common central nervous system (CNS) complication of AIDS worldwide and
      accounts for up to a third of all deaths from AIDS in many developing countries. Current
      treatments for CM are lacking in both effectiveness and accessibility, particularly in
      limited-resources settings. Conventional therapies utilizing an amphotericin B deoxycholate
      (ampho B)-based regimen require maintaining intravenous access (IV) and monitoring and
      treating any associated complications. The price to acquire ampho B can also be prohibitive
      to successful treatment. Cumulatively, a treatment course with ampho B is neither cost
      effective nor administratively efficient, leaving patients either untreated or inadequately
      treated with low-dose regimens of fluconazole alone.

      Fluconazole is widely available, inexpensive, can be given orally, has a demonstrated safety
      profile over a broad range of doses, and has proven activity against the fungus that causes
      CM, Cryptococcus neoformans. All of these factors make fluconazole a potential treatment
      option for a wide range of people. However, at its present recommended dosage, fluconazole
      is only expected to be successful in 34% to 42% of patients. This rate is lower than
      regimens combining fluconazole with other treatments including flucytosine or ampho B.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether high-dose fluconazole is safe and effective
      for the treatment of CM for up to 10 weeks. This study will also collect information about
      treating CM with ampho B (either alone or with another drug, either flucytosine or
      fluconazole).

      For this study, up to 168 HIV-infected people with CM will participate for a duration of 24
      weeks. This study will proceed in 2 stages and each stage may consist of up to 4 steps.
      Participants may take part in only one stage of the study. Stage 1 will measure the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of fluconazole in participants. Stage 2 will be for the purpose of dose
      validation.

      Stage 1 of the study was completed in January 2014. The two higher doses of fluconazole that
      were tested in Stage 1 (1600 mg/day and 2000 mg/day) will be tested further in Stage 2 of
      the study.

      In Stage 1, participants were randomly assigned to receive either fluconazole only or an
      ampho B-based regimen (a regimen that is either ampho B alone or ampho B in combination with
      5-fluorocytosine or fluconazole, according to the local standard of care).Three doses of
      fluconazole were tested, and the MTD was found to be 2000 mg/day. The two higher doses of
      fluconazole tested in Stage 1 (1600 mg/day and 2000 mg/day doses) will be tested further in
      Stage 2 of the study.

      Participants enrolled in Stage 2 will be randomly assigned to Step 1 to receive treatment
      with either fluconazole only (at one of the 2 doses found to be safe in Stage 1) or an ampho
      B-based regimen.

      After randomization in Step 1, participants in either Stage 1 or Stage 2 may enroll in up to
      three additional steps. In Step 2, participants who were randomly assigned to receive the
      ampho B-based regimen and who are intolerant to the regimen (experience a treatment limiting
      toxicity [TLT]) will receive fluconazole only. Participants who are receiving study-provided
      fluconazole in Step 1 or in Step 2 may enroll in Step 3 if they have a negative
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture. Participants in Step 3 will receive fluconazole (at the
      same or a lower dose than in Step 1 or Step 2) until Week 10. At Week 10, all participants
      will enroll in Step 4 and receive a lower daily dose of fluconazole (i.e., less than
      received in Steps 1, 2, or 3) until the end of the study (Week 24). Participants in both
      stages beginning treatment with ampho B will receive daily ampho B intravenously for up to 2
      weeks. Fluconazole will be given orally.

      Before entering the study, potential participants will attend a screening visit where they
      will have their CM diagnosis confirmed with CSF collected via lumbar puncture. HIV testing
      will also be conducted, along with clinical assessments, and a health and medical history
      questionnaire. Participants will also have a blood collection, an electrocardiogram (ECG),
      and a pregnancy test (if applicable). Once accepted into the study, participants will again
      answer questions about their health and medication history; have a complete physical exam,
      blood collection, HIV testing, neurological exam, lumbar puncture, and ECG; and may have a
      pregnancy test (if applicable).

      Participants will have study visits during Weeks 1 (at Days 1, 4, and 7), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
      and 24, and may have extra visits for individualized reasons. Total study duration will be
      24 weeks. Plasma, urine, serum, and CSF samples will be collected from all participants and
      stored for possible future use.

             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by or within 10 days after study entry by a licensed Western blot or a
             second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, by

             infections, reasonable certainty that the site investigator will be able to perform
             CSF sampling and manage expected study drug toxicities. More information on this
             criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  For female participants of reproductive potential (defined as girls who have reached
