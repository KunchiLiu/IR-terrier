      The purpose of this study is to study how changes in the body during pregnancy influence the
      blood levels of TMC114 (darunavir) and ritonavir taken together, darunavir and cobicistat
      taken as a fixed-dose combination, TMC125 (etravirine) taken alone or with darunavir and
      ritonavir or rilpivirine in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). This study
      will examine how these drugs are absorbed in the body, how they are distributed within the
      body and how they are removed from the body over time. Any pregnant woman who is currently
      receiving darunavir with ritonavir, darunavir with cobicistat, etravirine or rilpivirine for
      HIV-1, and who meets the eligibility criteria for the study, will be allowed to enroll.
      Patients must be willing to remain on study medication during the course of their pregnancy,
      and 12 weeks postpartum. The information collected may help answer questions about how to
      best prescribe these three drugs for pregnant women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many biological changes that occur during pregnancy, some of which may affect the
      way HIV medications are absorbed, distributed and removed within the body. Some medications
      have been used for HIV treatment during pregnancy, but little is known about how pregnancy
      affects the class of drugs being used in this study. To participate in this study, patients
      must be receiving 600mg of TMC114 (darunavir) taken with 100mg ritonavir twice daily or
      800mg of TMC114 (darunavir) with 100mg of ritonavir once daily or 800 mg of darunavir taken
      with 150mg of cobicistat taken once daily or 200mg of TMC125 (etravirine) (with or without
      darunavir/ ritonavir) taken twice daily or 25mg of TMC278 (rilpivirine) taken once daily
      plus additional antiretroviral drugs needed to construct an active antiretroviral regimen.
      Darunavir and ritonavir, darunavir and cobicistat, etravirine, or rilpivirine will be
      supplied to study participants. Darunavir and ritonavir are human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV) protease inhibitors (PIs); cobicistat is a pharmacoenhancer which boosts the levels of
      darunavir but has no anti-HIV activity; etravirine and rilpivirine are non-nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV. Twelve-hour or twenty four-hour blood
      sampling will be done for each patient at each of three study visits: Visit 4 (2nd
      trimester), Visit 5 (3rd trimester), and Visit 8 (6-12 weeks postpartum). Eight blood draws
      will be taken during each visit: One prior to intake of study medication, and one for each
      of seven post-dose sampling time-points (hours 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12). The study is
      designed primarily to examine the pharmacokinetics of darunavir/ritonavir (darunavir/r),
      darunavir/ cobicistat, etravirine or rilpivirine during the second and third trimesters of
      gestation, as well as postpartum. Pharmacokinetics measures how the body absorbs,
      distributes and excretes medication. The study will also examine any changes in anti-viral
      activity during pregnancy, and the postpartum period. It will note any safety and
      tolerability of the medications used by the mother, and will measure the level of
      darunavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ cobicistat, etravirine or rilpivirine in the newborn's cord
      blood at the time of delivery; outcomes for both mother and child will be assessed as well.
      During the treatment period, patients will be seen at regular visits in the clinic, where
      the investigator will assess the patient's medical condition, any Adverse Events and study
      drug compliance. Laboratory evaluations for efficacy and safety will be done at regular
      visits as well as blood pressure monitoring. Up to forty-eight (48) HIV positive pregnant
      women will participate in this study. Study enrollment will be closed once 12 evaluable
      patients taking darunavir/ritonavir once daily, 12 evaluable patients taking
      darunavir/cobicistat once daily, 12 evaluable patients taking darunavir/ritonavir twice
      daily, 12 evaluable patients taking etravirine taking twice daily and 12 evaluable patients
      taking rilpivirine once daily have been enrolled. The study will be conducted at
      approximately 14 research centers in the United States and 1 in Puerto Rico. In order to
      participate, patients must be pregnant for 13-24 weeks. The primary purpose (or outcome) of
      the study is to assess the influence of pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics of
      darunavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ cobicistat, etravirine or rilpivirine during the second and
      third trimesters of gestation, as well as postpartum. Darunavir: One 600 mg or two 300 mg
      tablets taken twice daily by mouth (two or four tablets a day total). Ritonavir: 100mg
      tablet taken twice daily by mouth (two tablets a day total), together with darunavir.
      Darunavir: Two 400 mg tablets taken once daily by mouth (two tablets a day total).
      Ritonavir: 100mg tablet taken once daily by mouth (one tablet a day total), together with
      darunavir. Darunavir/ cobicistat: a fixed dose combination containing 800mg of darunavir and
      150mg of cobicistat. Etravirine: Two 100 mg tablets taken twice daily by mouth (four tablets
      a day total). Rilpivirine: One 25mg tablet taken once daily by mouth (one tablet a day
      total). Study medication will be given from the baseline visit (second pregnancy trimester)
      until Visit 8 (up to 12 weeks after delivery).
