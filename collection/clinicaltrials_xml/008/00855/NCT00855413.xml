      Procedures (methods): ARV treatment with Darunavir/ritonavir and Etravirine,

      Optional studies:

      Genital secretion samples, Cerebrospinal fluid samples, Leukapheresis, Endoscopy/colonoscopy

      Study Design

      This is a multicenter, single arm, 48-week open-label pilot study of DRV/R &amp; ETR in acute
      HIV infection. Study sites will be members of the Duke-UNC Acute HIV Infection Study
      Consortium. If baseline resistance is detected after treatment begins (e.g. evidence of
      pre-existing baseline resistance (genotypic or phenotypic) that may adversely affect the
      efficacy of the study regimen), the patient may elect to alter treatment as per best
      clinical practice. The new regimen will not be provided by the study, but will be obtained
      for the participant through available clinical resources.

      After patients are identified with acute HIV infection, they will be offered the opportunity
      to participate in the study. Patients will also be offered the opportunity to co-enroll in
      CHAVI 001 and 012, studies that follow the virological and immunological response of
      patients with AHI, regardless of the initiation of ART. An overall consent form will be
      signed for study participation, and separate informed consents with signatures will be
      obtained for optional studies. Patients will be eligible for participation after signing the
      overall consent - agreeing to participate in studies of other compartment specimens is not
      required for enrollment. At the initial visit, patient eligibility will be confirmed with
      appropriate laboratory testing (see &quot;STUDY POPULATION&quot;). When eligibility is verified, entry
      laboratory studies will be obtained, and the participants will be started on DRV/r, and ETR.
      All participants will be followed at regular intervals thereafter as specified in the
      schedule of evaluations. Participants meeting criteria for virologic failure will be offered
      the opportunity to switch to the best available regimen as selected by their HIV provider.

      Hypothesis

      Combination therapy with DRV/R &amp; ETR will suppress plasma viremia and improve immunologic
      function in antiretroviral (ART)-naïve, acutely HIV-infected (AHI) patients, and will limit
      replication in HIV-1 cellular compartments.

          2. Men and women age ≥18 years.

          3. Participants will be ART naïve, defined as ≤14 days of antiretroviral treatment at
             any time prior to entry. The only exceptions are: Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)

             completion of the PEP treatment.

         13. For women of reproductive potential, a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within
             7 days prior to initiating antiretroviral study medications. Reproductive potential
             is defined as females who have reached menarche and have not been post-menopausal for
             at least 24 consecutive months, or have not undergone surgical sterilization (e.g.,
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or salpingotomy). Acceptable documentation of

         14. If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, female study
             patients must use at least one form of contraception, which could consist only of a
             barrier method. All patients must continue to use contraception for 6 weeks after
             stopping the study medications. Acceptable methods of contraception include: condoms
             (male or female) with or without spermicidal agent, diaphragm or cervical cap with
             spermicide, or IUD. Female volunteers not of reproductive potential are not required

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          2. Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment or prior to study drug
             administration.

          3. Women of reproductive potential who are unwilling or unable to use acceptable methods
             to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period

          4. Use of immunomodulators (e.g., interleukins, interferons, cyclosporine), HIV vaccine,
             systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, or investigational therapy within 30 days prior to
             study entry.

               -  Prednisone at a daily dose of 10 mg or less (physiologic replacement dose) is
                  permitted.

          5. Known allergy/sensitivity to study drugs or their formulations.

          6. Difficulty swallowing capsules/tablets.

          7. Inability to communicate effectively with study personnel.

          8. Incarceration; prisoner recruitment and participation are not permitted.

          9. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements or confound the
             analysis of study endpoints.

         10. Any active psychiatric illness including schizophrenia, severe depression, or severe
             bipolar affective disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound
             the analysis of the neurological examination or neuropsychological test results.

         11. Active brain infection (except for HIV-1), brain neoplasm, space-occupying brain
             lesion requiring acute or chronic therapy. Participants with any fungal meningitis,
