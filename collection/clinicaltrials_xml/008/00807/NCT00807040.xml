  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with coronary artery disease (CAD) or people who have had a heart attack may develop
      a leak in the mitral valve of their heart and may therefore need to undergo surgery to fix
      the valve. The best way to fix the mitral valve remains undetermined. This study will
      evaluate whether it is better for people with severe mitral valve leakage to undergo a
      mitral valve replacement procedure or a mitral valve repair procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAD occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become blocked as a result of
      plaque buildup. In severe cases, CAD can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart
      attack. After a heart attack, some people may develop a leak in the mitral valve of the
      heart. This condition is known as ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR), and it can cause
      blood to flow backward into the heart. If left untreated, severe IMR can lead to heart
      failure or serious heart rhythm irregularities, known as arrhythmias. People with severe
      mitral valve leakage routinely undergo one of two surgical procedures to fix the mitral
      valve: a mitral valve repair procedure, in which a surgical ring is used to repair the
      valve; or a mitral valve replacement procedure, in which the damaged valve is replaced with
      a new one. Currently, there is no consensus in the medical community as to which procedure
      is more beneficial. The purpose of this study is to determine whether people with severe
      mitral valve regurgitation should undergo a mitral valve repair procedure or a mitral valve
      replacement procedure.

      This study will enroll people with CAD who have severe mitral regurgitation. At a baseline
      study visit, participants will undergo a physical examination; blood collection;
      neurocognitive tests; and questionnaires regarding medical history, medication history, and
      quality of life. In the operating room, participants will be randomly assigned to undergo
      either the mitral valve repair procedure or the mitral valve replacement procedure. Blood,
      urine, and tissue samples may be collected from participants after the surgery; this is
      optional and will only be done with prior approval from participants. All participants will
      attend study visits at Day 30 and Months 6, 12, and 24. At each visit, participants will
      take part in a medication history review, a physical examination, an echocardiogram, a
      cardiopulmonary exercise test, neurocognitive tests, and quality of life surveys.

    <description>Mitral valve replacement will include complete preservation of the subvalvar apparatus. The technique of preservation, choice of prosthetic valve, and technique of suture placement will be dependent on the surgeon's preference. The prosthetic valve will be tested for paravalvular leaks by using the left ventricular saline infusion test.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic severe ischemic mitral regurgitation (often with tethering as a major
             mechanism) in the judgment of the clinical site echocardiographer, assessed by

             using an integrative method (Zoghbi W. et al. J. American Society of
             Echocardiography. 2003:16:777-802. see appendix). Quantitative guidelines as proposed
             would be: ERO â‰¥ 0.4 cmsq. If ERO &lt; 0.4, then the degree of mitral regurgitation will
             be guided by other color Doppler quantitative methods (jet area/left atrial area
