  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progerias are rare &quot;premature aging&quot; diseases in which children die of severe
      atherosclerosis leading to strokes and heart attacks. It is a multisystem disease with
      objective clinical markers for disease progression. These include abnormalities in growth
      and body composition, bone mineral density, join function, endocrine function, alopecia, and
      vascular disease. There is currently no therapy proven effective for any of the progressive
      and deleterious aspects of this disorder.

      Progeria is caused by a gene defect in the gene LMNA, coding for the nuclear protein lamin
      A. Lamin A is normally expressed by most differentiated cells, and requires
      posttranslational farnesylation to incorporate into the nuclear membrane. This trial
      proposes to use three agents (zoledronic acid, pravastatin, and lonafarnib) to inhibit
      farnesylation of abnormal lamin, the disease causing protein in Progeria. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of administering intravenous
      zoledronic acid, oral pravastatin and oral lonafarnib, to patients wtih Progeria for a
      minimum of 4 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label single arm feasibility trial. A combination of two oral agents
      (pravastatin and lonafarnib) and one intravenous (IV) agent (zoledronic acid) will be
      administered at doses and schedule currently applied in pediatrics. These agents all target
      farnesylation pathways at different points. Our goal is to inhibit farnesylation of abnormal
      lamin, the disease-causing protein in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and progeroid
      laminopathies (henceforth &quot;progeria&quot;). The drugs will include the intravenous bisphosphonate
      zoledronic acid, oral HMG co-reductase inhibitor pravastatin and the oral
      farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) lonafarnib (SCH 66336). Patients with genetically
      confirmed progeria will be eligible for this protocol. Treatment will be initiated for 4
      weeks duration and may be extended depending on tolerability. This study will assess the
      feasibility of this treatment regimen in the first 4 weeks. If tolerated for 4 weeks,
      patients can be treated with this regimen for up to 6 months.
