  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the addition of a drug called Avastin
      (avastin) to the two-drug combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel shrinks tumors better
      than the two-drug combination alone in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Avastin is a
      humanized monoclonal antibody (a type of protein that is normally made by the immune system
      to help defend the body from infection and cancer) produced by Genentech, Inc. Avastin is an
      antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. VEGF is a potent,
      specific growth factor with a well defined role in normal and abnormal blood vessel
      formation. It is present in a wide variety of normal tissues, but is produced in excess by
      most solid cancers (tumors). In the setting of cancer, VEGF promotes the growth of blood
      vessels that feed the tumor cells.

           peripheral vascular disease

        -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Blood coagulation parameters: PT such
           that international normalized ratio (INR) is less than 1.5 (or an in range INR, between
           2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a PTT less than
           1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal.

        -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
           prior to study enrollment or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during
           the course of the study.

        -  Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access
           device, within 7 days prior to study enrollment.

      -History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra- abdominal abscess
      within 6 months prior to study enrollment. Patients with clinical symptoms or signs of
      gastrointestinal obstruction and who require parenteral hydration and/or nutrition.

        -  Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

        -  Proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by:

        -  Urine protein:creatinine (UPC) ratio greater than or equal to 1.0 at screening

        -  Known hypersensitivity to any component of avastin.

        -  Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or lactating. Refusal to use of effective means of
           contraception (men and women) in subjects of child-bearing potential.
