      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a
      booster dose of pneumococcal vaccines (GSK 2189242A) in young adults.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT 00707798)

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history, clinical
             examination and clinical laboratory assessment before entering into the study.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential (defined as pre-menarche, current tubal

          -  Physical examination positive for acrocyanosis, jaundice, splenomegaly.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant anaemia, pulmonary, cardiovascular,
             hematologic, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical
             examination or laboratory screening tests, at the discretion of the investigator

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
