      This research is being done to study mechanisms of progression of COPD and to develop
      treatments for it. The investigators are doing the present study to identify people age 40
      and older with mild to moderate COPD who will qualify for such studies to include in a
      database. The study will include establishing a screening evaluation or characterization of
      the following two studies:

        -  Emphysema Progression in COPD- Losartan's Effects on Airway Parameters - NA_00009980

        -  Sleep-Related Physiology and Inflammation in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease -
           NA_00001771

      This is a program to recruit and screen participants for clinical trials or more detailed
      observational studies of COPD. There are no interventions or comparative results to be
      published from this study.
