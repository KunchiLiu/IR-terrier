  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if it is possible to deliver high dose
      radiation in one week while also giving the drug capecitabine for the treatment of
      pancreatic cancer prior to surgery, to determine if this treatment can be given safely for
      the treatment of pancreatic cancer prior to surgery and, to determine if this treatment can
      improve the local control pancreatic cancer prior to surgery compared to historical controls
      of standard treatment.

      -  Since we are looking for the best schedule and dose of radiation that can be
           administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants with
           pancreatic cancer, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive
           the same dose of radiation therapy. The dose participants will get will depend upon the
           number of participants enrolled in the study and how well they have tolerated their
           doses.

        -  Radiation treatment days will begin on a weekday and continue for a total of 7 to 12
           days. Capecitabine pills will begin on the morning of the first day of radiation and be
           taken twice a day for 10 consecutive weekdays, while the participant is receiving
           radiation.

        -  Blood tests, vital signs and a physical exam will be performed on day 1 and day 15 and
           either days 7, 8, or 9.

        -  Surgery will be performed 1 to 3 weeks after completion of radiation and capecitabine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cytologic or histologic proof of pancreatic ductal carcinoma is required prior to
             treatment.

             physical exam, chest CT, and abdominal CT with intravenous contrast.

          -  Only potentially resectable patients are eligible. Potentially resectable is defined
             as: a)no extrapancreatic disease, b)no evidence (on CT) of involvement of the celiac
             axis or superior mesenteric artery, and c)no evidence (on CT or MRI) of occlusion of
             the superior mesenteric vein or superior mesenteric-portal venous confluence.
