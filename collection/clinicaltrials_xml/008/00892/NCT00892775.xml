  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is undertaken to generate clinical data on GSK Biologicals' combined
      measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine manufactured with measles and rubella obtained from
      newly established working seed viruses which are one passage further than the current
      working seed viruses. The measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine manufactured with the
      current working seed viruses will serve as comparator.

      A seed lot system is a system according to which successive batches of a vaccine are derived
      from the same master seed virus. For routine production, a working seed lot is prepared from
      the master seed virus.
