  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the biggest threats to health in the 21st century. Rapid weight gain in
      the first year of life tends to lead to overweight in children, which in turn leads to
      overweight in adults. This rapid early weight gain occurs most often at weaning when eating
      patterns emerge. Infant sleep problems also appear to be associated with the risk of
      becoming overweight, and contribute to maternal post-natal depression. We propose to
      undertake a 4-arm randomised controlled trial to determine whether extra education and
      support for families around weaning and development of early food and activity habits, with
      or without intervention to improve infant sleep, will decrease the current risk patterns of
      rapid excessive early childhood weight gain in New Zealand. This would provide strong
      evidence for the value of such a strategy in the long term control of the obesity epidemic
      and its consequent complications.

      We plan on undertaking a 4-arm randomised controlled trial to test the following hypotheses:

        1. That anticipatory guidance and extra education and support in infancy around weaning
           and decreasing/avoiding TV watching will delay the timing of introduction of solid
           foods, will be associated with more successful introduction of nutrient dense foods
           with appropriate portion size and decrease small screen exposure leading to a lower
           number of children with excessive weight velocity in infancy and early childhood.

        2. That anticipatory guidance, education and extra support around the early development of
           infant sleeping patterns will decrease sleep problems, increase infant sleeping time,
           decrease arousals at night and lower sleep latency which will in turn influence rate of
           early infant weight gain.

        3. That interventions 1 and 2 will interact additively with regard to infant and early
           childhood weight gain.

        4. That intervention 2 will lead to lower rates of maternal depression and increased
           family well being.

    <description>Standard well child care plus 5 extra contacts focussed on Sleep with 1 before birth (anticipatory guidance), sleep problem prevention starting at 3 weeks and then sleep problem intervention starting at 6 months or if problems emerge upto 2 years of age. Main prevention advice focussed on placing baby to sleep awake, maximising night-day differences and use of sleep place in parents bedroom for first 6 months. Intervention after 6 months uses preferentially a technique called &quot;parental presence&quot;, and if this does not fit family a technique called &quot;camping out&quot; and finally, if neither of the first two fit family, controlled crying.</description>
