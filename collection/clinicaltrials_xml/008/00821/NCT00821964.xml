  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving topical imiquimod together with
      Abraxane (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) to see how well it works
      in treating patients with advanced breast cancer. Biological therapies, such as imiquimod,
      may stimulate the immune system to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      Abraxane, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving imiquimod together with Abraxane may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of chemoimmunotherapy with topical imiquimod and Abraxane in
      breast cancer patients with recurrent chest wall disease or cutaneous metastasis.

      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor effects of chemoimmunotherapy with topical imiquimod and
      Abraxane in breast cancer patients with recurrent chest wall disease or cutaneous
      metastasis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine whether treatment with chemoimmunotherapy consisting of topical imiquimod and
      Abraxane augments endogenous tumor specific immunity.

      II. To assess the effect of chemoimmunotherapy on circulating transforming growth factor
      (TGF)-beta levels.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Abraxane intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and apply
      topical imiquimod to cutaneous lesions once daily (QD) on days 1-4, 8-11, 15-18, and 22-25.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
