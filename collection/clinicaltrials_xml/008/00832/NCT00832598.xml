  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us understand gliomas, one type of brain tumor. This
      research protocol makes pictures of gliomas. We will take pictures of the glioma before and
      after treatment. The pictures are made with a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner.
      PET scans use radioactive markers to &quot;see&quot; cancer cells. We plan to use two different
      radioactive markers, [18F]FACBC and [18F]FLT, to &quot;see&quot; if the glioma responds to the
      treatment being recommended by the doctor. We are investigating whether one or both of these
      types of PET scans can help us to better understand gliomas and their response to treatment.

      We expect these pictures will give us information the your tumor and may help us to
      understand why the treatment that the patient is receiving is affecting the tumor the way
      that it is. We also hope to collect information about the amount of radioactivity exposure.
      We will measure radioactivity exposure to the tumor, brain and other organs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Registered patient at MSKCC.

          -  Child-bearing age females must be non-pregnant,(documented by a negative pregnancy
             test within the last 2 weeks), non-lactating, and must be using adequate
             contraception or be surgically sterile.

          -  Patients with gliomas

          -  Patients planning to start anti-AKT and/or anti-VEGF directed therapies .

          -  Patients with measurable disease on MRI or CT neuroimaging.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is incontinent of urine or stool (which would make them unable to tolerate
             lying still for 60 minutes).

          -  Patient cannot tolerate lying still for a 60 minute session in the PET tomograph.
