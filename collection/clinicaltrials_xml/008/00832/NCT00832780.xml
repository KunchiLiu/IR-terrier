    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the response of lung tumors to radiation therapy.
      This study will be using a type of radiation therapy called tomotherapy. Tomotherapy is a
      relatively new kind of therapy which is able to focus a large amount of radiation to a small
      area with relatively less radiation to the surrounding non-cancerous part of the organ. This
      study is being done to find out if this technique is able to control the cancer better or
      not than the standard radiation and also to study its safety.

    <textblock>
      The introduction of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has allowed safe dose
      escalation in treatment regimens for cancer. Several studies have shown a radiation
      dose-response relationship for survival and local control for tumors of the lung, including
      cancer that originates in the lung (such as non-small cell lung cancer) as well as cancer
      that metastasizes to the lung.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate and toxicity of SBRT treatment
      of patients with lung tumors. This study will use a dose of 60 gray (Gy) in 5 fractions of
      12 Gy. This provides a biological equivalent dose with alpha/beta ratio of 10 (BED10) of 132
      Gy with the anticipation of achieving local control without increased toxicity. Previous
      studies have shown that the response rate with SBRT across multiple studies is approximately
      50%, with an additional 25-40% of patients having stable disease. We hypothesize that this
      regimen will achieve a response rate of 70% with grade 3 toxicity of less than 5%.

    <description>RR is evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). Target lesions are assessed by computerized tomography (CT): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. RR is the sum of the percentage of patients who achieved a CR or PR. (RR = CR + PR)</description>

    <description>The time from treatment initiation to disease progression or death by any cause. Progression is evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). Target lesions are assessed by computerized tomography (CT): Progressive Disease (PD), 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>CBR is evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all evidence of target and non-target lesions. Partial response (P): &gt;= 30% reduction from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter of all lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. CBR is the sum of the percentage of patients who achieve a CR, PR or SD (CBR = CR + PR + SD).</description>
