    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies OPT-821 and vaccine therapy to see how well they
      work compared with OPT-821 alone in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer,
      fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cancer that has decreased or disappeared, but the
      cancer may still be in the body. Biological therapies, such as OPT-821, may stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines may help the
      body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether
      OPT-821 is more effective with or without vaccine therapy in treating patients with ovarian
      epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if a polyvalent vaccine (including GM2-keyhole limpet hemocyanin [KLH],
      Globo-H-KLH, Tn-mucin 1 [MUC1]-32mer-KLH, and Thompson Friedreich antigen [TF]-KLH plus
      OPT-821) decreases the hazard of progression or death compared to a vaccine containing
      OPT-821 alone in women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer in
      second or third complete clinical remission.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the treatment arms with respect to the incidence of toxicities. II. To
      determine if the polyvalent vaccine decreases the hazard of death compared to a vaccine
      containing OPT-821 alone in women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal
      cancer in second or third complete clinical remission.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the immune response (by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) in
      participants, in order to determine if the outcome correlates with antigen-specific immune
      titers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive polyvalent antigen-KLH conjugate vaccine and immunological adjuvant
      OPT-821 subcutaneously (SC) once in weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 23, 35, 47, 59, 71, and 83 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive immunological adjuvant OPT-821 SC as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <description>Characterized by treatment group with Kaplan-Meier plots and estimates of the median time until death or progression. A stratified log-rank test will be used to examine whether the two treatment groups are different after stratifying by second or third complete remission (CR). Second, a Cox proportional hazards model will be used to test the interaction of treatment arm and 2nd/3rd CR.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 83 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Analyses will be conducted on the measures of immune response to assess the effects of the study regimens on these endpoints and to determine whether these endpoints are associated with clinical outcomes (PFS and overall survival). Immune response will be measured at repeated time points (week 1 [prior to treatment], and weeks 11, 17, 23, 35, 47, 59, 71, and 83). Therefore, the relationship of immune response with PFS and overall survival will be examined with Cox proportional hazards models with immune response as a time-dependent covariate.</description>
