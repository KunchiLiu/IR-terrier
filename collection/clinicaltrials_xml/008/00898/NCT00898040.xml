      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at DNA samples from patients with multiple
      myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether there is an increased frequency of 1 or more polymorphic alleles that
           are associated with clinical endpoints using custom myeloma single nucleotide
           polymorphism (SNP) chip analysis of banked DNA samples from patients with multiple
           myeloma.

        -  Determine SNPs associated with toxicities caused, not by variations in tumor cell
           genetics, but by individual genetic variations affecting drug activation, distribution,
           metabolism, and export (ADME).

        -  Determine SNPs associated with response, influenced by the same ADME.

        -  Determine SNPs associated with bone disease (as a variable) among patients with
           multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine SNPs associated with epidemiology (i.e., risk factors for the development of
           multiple myeloma).

      OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, multicenter study.

      Banked DNA samples are analyzed using a custom single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to
      assess approximately 3,590 SNPs from 1,061 genes that are associated with myeloma growth and
      response.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients will be accrued for this study.
