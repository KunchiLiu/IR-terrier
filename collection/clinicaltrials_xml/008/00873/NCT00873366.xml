      RATIONALE: A breath test that measures enzymes may be effective in identifying women in whom
      tamoxifen may not be effective.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying a breath test to see how well it works in women
      receiving tamoxifen for the prevention or treatment of breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the operating characteristics of the ¹³C-dextromethorphan (^13 C-DM) breath
           test in identifying women with breast cancer (or at high risk) who are CYP2D6-genotypic
           poor metabolizers.

        -  To examine the correlation between CYP2D6 enzyme activity (as measured by the breath
           test) and plasma endoxifen (and 4-hydroxyTAM) levels in patients who carry one or more
           CYP2D6 functional alleles.

        -  To examine the change in CYP2D6 enzyme activity (as measured by the ¹³C-DM breath
           test), in patients who start a CYP2D6 inhibitor while taking tamoxifen.

        -  To determine whether CYP2D6 enzyme activity (as measured by the breath test) changes
           over time (either as a consequence of drug-induced inhibition or other).

        -  To measure genetic variation in additional genes that are later identified to affect
           the metabolism, uptake, or distribution of tamoxifen (e.g., SULT1A1, UGT).

      OUTLINE: Patients receive tamoxifen citrate for 6 months. ^13C-dextromethorphan breath tests
      are conducted at baseline and periodically during the 6 months.

      13C-dextromethorphan breath test: Patients receive oral Alka-Seltzer® Gold (ASG; citric
      acid, potassium bicarbonate, and sodium bicarbonate) in water, then, 15 minutes later,
      another ASG dose and oral ¹³C-dextromethorphan. Patients breathe into a bag 1-2 times, and
      the is bag sealed. ¹³CO_2 levels in the bags are measured.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically for pharmacogenetic and
      pharmacokinetic studies by reverse phase HPLC with fluorescence detection.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed annually for 5 years.
