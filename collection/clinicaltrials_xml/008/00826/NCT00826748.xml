  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of inhaled beclomethasone (an inhaled
      corticosteroid) on the pattern of the lung airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages gene
      expression of healthy smokers. We hypothesize that the administration of beclomethasone will
      result in reversibility of some of the airway epithelium and alveolar macrophage gene
      expression changes induced by cigarette smoking.

      The study will involve healthy smokers and non smokers enrolled in IRB approved protocol
      #0005004439 entitled &quot;Evaluation of the Lungs of Normal (Smokers, Ex-smokers, Non-Smokers)
      Individuals with Segmental Bronchopulmonary Lung Lavage, Bronchial Brushing, and Bronchial
      Wall Biopsy&quot;. They will be invited to participate in this protocol only if they meet the
      additional inclusion/exclusion criteria of this protocol (see inclusion/exclusion criteria,
      section A6). The Principal Investigator, Ann E. Tilley, MD or authorized representative will
      obtain consent from individuals for this study. Once enrolled, smokers will be randomized to
      either the Group A [320 micrograms (mcg) of beclomethasone; 2 puffs twice a day (each puff
      delivers 80 mcg) for 7 days] or Group B (no treatment). Beclomethasone is available as a
      metered dose inhaler [QVAR(TEVA Pharmaceuticals)] delivering 80 micrograms (mcg) of
      beclomethasone per one puff. We will be using QVAR HFA (TEVA Pharmaceuticals), which
      delivers 80 mcg per puff. QVAR will be purchased by the Department of Genetic Medicine. It
      will be dispensed as appropriate to each research subject recruited in the trial at the
      Department of Genetic Medicine at 1305 York Ave YAB-13th floor, New York, NY 10021 (a
      facility of Weill Medical College). It will be stored at The Arthur &amp; Rochelle Belfer Gene
      Therapy Core Facility located at 515 E. 71st St., S901, New York, NY 10021 under the
      supervision of Stephen Kaminksy, PhD, Co-Director of the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice).
      Each study individual will receive 1 package of the study medication which consists of 1
      canister of QVAR 80 MDI (metered dose inhaler). Non-smokers, defined as individuals who have
      never smoked, will be part of Group C. Group C will act as control like Group B and receive
      no treatment. For Group A, Group B and Group C participants, the screening, baseline
      bronchoscopy, and the bronchoscopies on Days 7±3 and 14±3 tests will be performed as part of
      IRB approved protocol #0005004439. No additional bronchoscopies will be performed under the
      current protocol.
