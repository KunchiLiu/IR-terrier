      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of acupuncture as a
      complementary therapy to pain medication for joint pain associated with aromatase inhibitors
      for breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer patients are living longer largely due to the
      benefits of hormonal therapy. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a new class of hormonal agents
      which block estrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women. However, musculoskeletal pain occurs
      in up to 50% of patients treated with AIs and often does not respond to conventional pain
      medications. AI-induced joint pain interferes with patient compliance and may cause major
      disability. Therefore, safe and effective treatments are needed to alleviate AI-induced
      musculoskeletal pain.

      Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese method of medical treatment and a popular modality for
      treating musculoskeletal pain. Acupuncture involves the use of thin needles to stimulate
      specific points of the body and leads to pain control through the release of endorphin in
      the central nervous system. Clinical trials have found a benefit of acupuncture for the
      treatment of knee and back pain. Given the lack of effective treatments for AI-induced joint
      pain and the safety and efficacy of acupuncture, it is therefore reasonable to evaluate
      whether acupuncture is effective in breast cancer patients who experience musculoskeletal
      pain related to AIs.

      This is a randomized controlled pilot study, twenty participants will be recruited in each
      arm directly by their oncologist from the Breast Oncology clinic of Columbia University
      Medical Center. The study will include postmenopausal women over the age of 45 years,
      currently taking an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of early stage breast cancer and
      experiencing musculoskeletal pain in one or more joints. We hypothesize that acupuncture
      will reduce AI induced joint symptoms

      This is aa randomized, controlled, pilot study to determine the safety and efficacy of
      acupuncture as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment compared to pharmacological
      intervention alone for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain related to aromatase inhibitors
      in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Twenty participants (20 in each arm) will be
      enrolled at the Breast Oncology clinic at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC).
      Patients in the treatment arm will receive acupuncture administered twice weekly for six
      weeks and will be allowed to take pain medication as necessary. The control patients will
      initially receive pain medication alone, then will cross-over to the acupuncture arm after
      six weeks.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the change in joint pain related to
      aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer patients treated with acupuncture and pharmacological
      therapy compared to pharmacological intervention alone before and after treatment. The
      primary efficacy endpoint will be a change in the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF)
      before and after treatment. Secondary objectives of this study include a change in the
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index, dosage of analgesics
      (acetaminophen, NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors) consumed, quality of life as measured
      by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), blood levels of IL and TNF,
      frequency and severity of adverse events according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
      Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0, and assessment of attitudes towards complementary and
      alternative medicine.

      The primary hypothesis is that acupuncture in conjunction with pharmacological treatment
      will decrease joint pain related to the use of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer
      patients compared to pharmacological therapy alone. This hypothesis will be tested using
      logistic regression with acupuncture (yes/no) as the predictor and the change in the BPI-SF
      score after treatment (at six weeks) compared to baseline as the outcome. The logistic model
      will allow for the adjustment of possible confounders such as age, body mass index and years
      since menopause. Secondary outcomes include change in the WOMAC index, FACT-B
      quality-of-life measure, dosage of analgesics consumed, and blood levels of IL-and TNF after
      treatment compared to baseline. The change in all efficacy outcomes will be assessed in all
      patients (including those who have delayed cross-over to acupuncture) before and after
      acupuncture treatment. For the patients who receive immediate acupuncture treatment, all
      efficacy outcomes will be reassessed at twelve weeks to examine the duration of effect upon
      completion of acupuncture. All treatment-related adverse events will be reported for both
      treatment arms. For the secondary endpoints, the differences between baseline, six weeks and
      twelve weeks will be studied for each efficacy outcome measure using descriptive statistics
      and graphical tools. Correlations between the biologic markers of inflammation and the
      efficacy measures will be evaluated by tabular and graphical form.

      The study will enroll a total of 40 patients, half of whom will be randomized to one of the
      two arms to receive acupuncture plus pharmacological treatment (arm A) or pharmacological
      treatment alone (arm B). Joint pain will be assessed by the BPI-SF score at baseline and six
      weeks. All patients will have a baseline BPI worst pain item (#2) â‰¥3 points on a scale of
      0-10.
