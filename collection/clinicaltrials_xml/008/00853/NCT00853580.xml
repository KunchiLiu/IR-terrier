  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether Lovastatin ™ significantly improves
      visual spatial learning and/or sustained attention in children with NF1.

      Secondary Aims:

      To evaluate the effect of Lovastatin ™ on measures of executive function, behavior and
      quality of life in children with NF1 and cognitive deficits.

      To further evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of Lovastatin ™ in children with NF1 and
      cognitive deficits.

      Hypotheses

      It is hypothesized that Lovastatin ™ will improve the visual spatial memory and/or attention
      deficits in children with NF1. This is based on studies demonstrating that Lovastatin ™ has
      significantly improved impairments in visual spatial memory and attention in the NF1 murine
      model.

      It is further expected that Lovastatin ™ will be safe and well tolerated over a 16-week
      period.

      Study Design

      This is a prospective multi-centre randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study to
      determine the efficacy of Lovastatin ™ on visual spatial learning and/or attention abilities
      of children with NF1 aged between 8 and less than 16 years. In addition, the effect of
      Lovastatin ™ on secondary measures of executive function, visual spatial skills, behavior
      and quality of life will be assessed. Participants will be randomized to 16-weeks of
      treatment with Lovastatin ™ or a matched placebo. It is plausible and ethical to employ a
      placebo group as no standard therapy with established efficacy is being withheld. There is
      no cross-over in this study due to a lack of data concerning the length of possible washout
      effects. The Lovastatin ™ dose will begin at 20 mg once daily/continuous dosing and escalate
      over a two-week period to 40 mg once daily/continuous dosing and continue at this dose for
      14 weeks. Participants will be carefully monitored for side effects. The safety of
      Lovastatin ™ will be evaluated using laboratory tests, clinical signs and adverse effects,
      which will be monitored at regular intervals over the 16-week period. Primary and secondary
      outcome measures will be administered at baseline, 16 weeks post-treatment and at follow-up,
      8 weeks after cessation of treatment to determine any carry-over effects. The safety of
      Lovastatin ™ will also be evaluated, with regular monitoring of side-effects during the
      trial.

      Study Population

      This is a Phase II study involving children with NF1 (aged between 8 years to 15 years 11
      months old at time of enrollment) with evidence of cognitive impairment, defined as having a
      score of at least one standard deviation or more below the population mean on a measure of
      visual spatial learning and/or attention.

      A total of 142 participants with NF1 aged between 8 years and 15 years 11 months will be
      enrolled in the study. The age limits were selected on the basis that Lovastatin ™ has been
      shown to be safe in children aged between 8 and 17 years old. In addition, one of the
      primary outcome measures (attention) only has normative data for up to 15 years 11 months.
      Therefore, the maximum age limit for participants at time of enrolment is 15 years 11 months
      so that normative data can be used to determine whether participants are impaired. The
      pediatric NF1 population is an ideal group in which to study the cognitive effects of
      Lovastatin ™ because it represents an opportunity for early pharmacological intervention of
      cognitive deficits.

             least one of these quotients is 70 or above

          -  Participants must have a cognitive impairment defined as having a score of at least
             one standard deviation or more below the population mean on one or more of the
             primary objective outcome measures (i.e., impaired on a measure of visual spatial
             learning and/or sustained attention)

          -  Participants must be medically stable

          -  Participants who are on a stable dose of methylphenidate and/or dextroamphetamines
             for at least one month prior to screening and who will remain on the same dose for
             the duration of the study.

          -  Hepatic function: Participants must have a bilirubin within normal limits and AST and
             ALT ± 2 times the upper limit of normal as determined by the standards at their
             institution

          -  Renal function: Participants must have an age-adjusted normal serum creatinine or a
             creatinine clearance of greater than 70 ml/m/1.73m2

          -  Hematologic function: Participants must have an absolute neutrophil count of greater
             than 1,500, a hemoglobin of greater than 9 gms/dl, and a platelet count of greater
             than 100,000 on study entry

          -  Participants must sign all required documents, including informed assent and HIPAA

             precautions to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Full-scale IQ less than 70; In cases where this is a statistically significant

             be associated with NF1

          -  Participants with a clinically significant unrelated illness, which in the judgment
             of the principal or associate investigator, would compromise the participant's
             ability to tolerate the medication or potentially interfere with the participant's
             ability to participate in the required testing
