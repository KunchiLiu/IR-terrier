  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to evaluate the use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic
      protein 2 (RhBMP-2) as compared to standard ICBG in the treatment of severe open tibia
      fractures with a critical size bone defect (at least one centimeter in length compromising
      at least 50% of the circumference of the bone).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open tibia fractures have a 15% or higher rate of not healing. Those fractures which do not
      heal are typically treated with bone from the hip (iliac crest autograft; or ICBG). The use
      of ICBG bone with the treatment of delayed unions/non-unions with critical defect, although
      successful, has its drawbacks. The bone graft sources are limited and the procedure is
      associated with additional operating room time plus a second incision with increased risk of
      infection, post operative pain and increased hospital stay. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if Rh-BMP2, a new bone graft substitute, is at least as effective as using bone
      from the hip (autograft) to help promote healing of open, tibia (shin bone) fractures.

      Research Questions:

      Primary:

      What is the relative effect of rhBMP-2 versus autogenous ICBG on rates of union in patients
      with critical size defects following tibial shaft fractures?

      Null hypothesis #1: rhBMP-2 has the same union rate when used in critical-sized defects as
      does ICBG.

      Secondary:

      What is the relative effect of rhBMP-2 versus autogenous ICBG on infection rates in patients
      with nonunion or critical size defects following tibial shaft fractures?

      Null hypothesis #2: The infection rate in open tibias with critical-sized defects treated
      with rhBMP-2 and autogenous ICBG are the same.

      What is the economic impact of the use of Rh-BMP 2 for tibial fractures with critical sized
      defects?

      Null hypothesis #3: There will be no difference in the economic cost of the treatment of
      critical sized defects using the RhBMP-2 versus iliac crest bone graft.

Clinical union as defined by pain-free full weight bearing and lack of tenderness ,swelling and pain at the fracture site on palpation. Pain will be documented using the VAS at each visit. Swelling will be defined as the absence of skin wrinkling.</description>
