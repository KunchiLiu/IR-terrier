    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of Zolpidem CR to that of
      placebo in improving sleep efficiency in people with dementia admitted to the hospital
      because of their symptoms. You can participate in this study if you have dementia of the
      Alzheimer's type or vascular dementia. This study involves placebo; a placebo is a tablet
      that looks exactly like Zolpidem CR, the study drug, but contains no active study drug. We
      will use placebos to see if the study results are due to the study drug or due to other
      reasons. Zolpidem CR is also called Ambien CR and is widely available by prescription.
      Zolpidem CR is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the short-term
      treatment of insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep).

      Sleep patterns normally change with age. Sleep/wake cycles appear to be compromised in
      people suffering from dementia. Most research involving sleep in dementia has involved
      community dwelling or nursing home residents. Relatively little is known about the sleep
      patterns of patients with dementia who develop acute behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and
      necessitate hospitalization. The relationship between sleep disturbances in these patients
      and behavioral/psychiatric symptoms is also insufficiently studied. The current study will
      examine these two sets of data (sleep/wake cycles and clinical symptoms) in a population of
      elderly subjects with Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) or vascular dementia (VD)
      during their hospitalization period. We will compare the sleep outcome measures (primarily
      sleep efficiency) and clinical outcome measures in subjects treated with Zolpidem CR or
      Placebo. We will utilize a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design to test our
      hypothesis that targeting sleep disturbances in hospitalized elderly subjects with DAT or VD
      leads to improvement in sleep and clinical outcomes.
