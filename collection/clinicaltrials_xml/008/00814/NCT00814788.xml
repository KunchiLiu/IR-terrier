      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy,
      such as bicalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Everolimus may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying bicalutamide and everolimus to see how well they
      work compared with bicalutamide in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To compare the PSA response rate in patients with hormone-independent recurrent or
           metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with bicalutamide and everolimus
           after first-line androgen deprivation therapy.

        -  To evaluate the time to treatment failure and overall survival of these patients.

        -  To assess the toxicity of bicalutamide and everolimus in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease status (metastatic disease vs
      biochemical recurrence without measurable disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      Patients receive oral bicalutamide and oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28-42 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Participants must be adult males &gt;18 years.

          2. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed CaP with a Gleason score
             available or interpretable.

          3. Patients must have CaP deemed to be androgen independent.

          4. Measurable disease is not required.

          5. Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated. If the method of
             castration was LHRH agonists (leuprolide or goserelin) or antagonists (degarelix),
             then the patient must be willing to continue the use of LHRH agonists or antagonists.
             Serum testosterone must be at castrate levels (&lt; 50 ng/dL) within 3 months prior to
             registration.

          6. Participant has not been on any previous therapy with androgen receptor antagonists
             or mTOR inhibitors. Note: patients who have taken an androgen receptor antagonist for
             a brief period (no more than 2 months) at the start of LHRH agonist therapy to
             prevent flare will be considered eligible.

          7. Men enrolled in this trial must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation.

          8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function.

          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

         10. ECOG performance status 0-2.

             study requirements.

          5. HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with RAD001.

          6. Patients currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer
             therapies within 4 weeks of the start of study drug (including chemotherapy,

             of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any
             major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or patients that may require
             major surgery during the course of the study.

          8. Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks.

             require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

         13. Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated basal or
             squamous cell carcinomas of the skin or other Stage 0 or I cancers.

         14. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of RAD001.
