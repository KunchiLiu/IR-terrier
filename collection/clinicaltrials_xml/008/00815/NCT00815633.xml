    <textblock>
      Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris (PRP) is a therapeutic challenge, and many different medication
      regimens exist to treat the condition. Clinical response is variable, and no single
      treatment has emerged as a leading therapy. Biologic agents have emerged as effective
      treatments for many skin diseases, including psoriasis. Given the clinical overlap between
      PRP and psoriasis, it is logical to attempt to use these agents for PRP. Since the majority
      of patients with PRP are unresponsive to current therapies, new treatment modalities must be
      evaluated. This study will evaluate the treatment of adult 30 years or older with a
      diagnosis of PRP, either subtypes 1 or 2. In this study, the safety and efficacy of
      alefacept will be evaluated in adult patients with PRP refractory to current treatments.
      Alefacept is a dimeric fusion protein containing the CD2 extracellular binding region of
      human leukocyte function antigen-3 (LFA-3) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. The drug
      binds to the T-lymphocyte antigen CD2 and blocks its interaction with LFA-3 on antigen
      presenting cells in the body. The CD2/LFA-3 interaction is a key co-stimulatory signal in
      the activation of T-lymphocytes central to the pathophysiology of psoriasis. It is theorized
      this interaction plays a role in the pathophysiology of PRP. Alefacept is currently approved
      for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe, chronic, plaque-type psoriasis. The
      medication is administered as weekly intramuscular injections for 12 week courses. In this
      study, a dose of 15mg alefacept will be administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for
      12 weeks. This is the dosing regimen currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis.
      Patients will be followed for a total of 24 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects may be male or female, 30 years old or older at time of consent

          2. Have a diagnosis of pityriasis rubra pilaris at least 6 months prior to
             administration of the first dose of the study medication

          3. Be a candidate for systemic therapy

          4. Women of childbearing potential and all men must use adequate contraceptive measures
             if sexually active. Examples include abstinence, oral contraceptives or other form of
             hormonal contraception, intrauterine devices, surgical sterilization, or barrier
             forms of contraception with spermicidal jelly. Subjects must agree to continue to use
             these contraceptive measures and agree not to become or plan a pregnancy within 12
             months of the date of the last study drug administration.

          5. Agree to adhere to the study visit schedule and protocol requirements, including
             blood draws and clinical photographs.
