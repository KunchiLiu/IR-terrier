    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is known to cause severe anaphylactic reactions.The goal of this proposal is
      to produce a new treatment that would benefit subjects who have peanut allergy by lowering
      the risk of anaphylactic reactions (desensitization), and changing the peanut-specific
      immune response in subjects who have peanut allergy (tolerance).

    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is known to cause severe anaphylactic reactions. Compared with other food
      allergies it tends to be more persistent and also its prevalence seems to be rising.
      Currently there is no proven treatment other than strict avoidance. We are attempting to
      decrease the risk of anaphylaxis on accidental ingestion by desensitizing subjects to peanut
      using peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT). We are also studying the effect of peanut OIT on the
      peanut specific immune response to determine if tolerance to peanut protein will develop.
      Children ages one to six years of age with peanut allergy will be randomized to peanut OIT
      or placebo (active subjects). Thirty subjects will also be recruited as controls. These
      subjects will not receive any peanut or placebo but only have skin prick testing and lab
      work in addition to a history and physical exam. Active subjects will undergo a modified
      rush immunotherapy on the first day and then increase the doses at least every two weeks up
      to a maintenance dose of 4 grams (equivalent to about 13 peanuts). Doses will be taken daily
      at home except for dose increases which will be done on the research unit. Outcome variables
      of interest include response to double-blind placebo controlled food challenge, skin prick
      testing, peanut specific IgE, and adverse events. These results will be compared between the
      start and end of peanut OIT using appropriate statistical analysis.
