  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to perform an exploratory study to investigate the effects of
      electro-stimulation of the legs on the symptoms and clinical findings of post thrombotic
      syndrome (PTS), as well as quality of life of patients with PTS. The investigators theorize
      that electro-stimulation will provide both a mechanical benefit via muscular contraction and
      increased venous outflow from the affected extremity, as well as an anesthetic effect, which
      the investigators anticipate will translate into improved symptomatic outcomes, quality of
      life (QOL) benefits.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal electrical stimulation intensity level
      at which subjects using the portable electrical muscle stimulator (VeinoPlus) have the
      largest benefit for relief of post thrombotic symptoms. To determine if the subjects
      reported benefit from the device and willingness to continue using the device.

      Subjects will be pre-screened on the phone for eligibility, and an initial appointment will
      be set. The subject will be given a device and complete a quality of life survey. The
      subject will also be assessed on the Villalta scale. After two months, the subjects will
      return for the final visit where the Villalta scale and quality of life survey will be
      reassessed, and the device taken back.

    <description>The Veinoplus® device electrically stimulates leg muscles via motor nerves, causing calf muscle contractions. The two electrodes are placed on the central part of the calf muscle on the back of the legs, and once the device is turned on, the length of treatment is 20 minutes. The device has a variable intensity setting which allows subjects to choose their own level and change the stimulations mid-cycle if desired. Subjects will use the device however they see fit for 2 months.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;18

          -  Presence of previously objectively documented unilateral, lower extremity deep venous
             thrombosis

          -  Presence of PTS (typical pain and swelling - worse after standing and vertical
             activity and relieved by rest and the horizontal position), severe enough that the
             patient is interested to explore a treatment option that might improve these
             symptoms. Symptoms had to have been stable for ≥ 3 months. Unstable symptoms are
             defined as: worsening, improving or variable symptoms over preceding months.
