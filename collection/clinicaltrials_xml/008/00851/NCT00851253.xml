      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and
      cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of stereotactic radiosurgery in
      treating patients with locally advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the feasibility and tolerability of CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery
           as boost therapy after standard chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced
           head and neck cancer.

        -  To determine the feasibility and tolerability of CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery
           as salvage therapy in patients with locally recurrent head and neck cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to disease status after
      prior standard therapy. Patients with residual disease after standard therapy are assigned
      to group 1. Patients with recurrent disease ≥ 6 months after standard therapy are assigned
      to group 2.

      All patients undergo placement of 3-6 gold fiducial markers within 1-2 weeks of beginning
      CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment.

        -  Group 1 (CyberKnife® SRS boost therapy): Patients undergo CyberKnife® SRS boost therapy
           (2 fractionated doses) beginning 4-8 weeks after completion of standard therapy.

        -  Group 2 (CyberKnife® SRS salvage therapy): Patients undergo CyberKnife® SRS salvage
           therapy (5 fractions) 3 times weekly.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.
