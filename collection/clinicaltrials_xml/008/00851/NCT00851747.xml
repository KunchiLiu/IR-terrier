    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of phosphatidylcholine and
      deoxycholate subcutaneous injections for localized fat removal.

      Subcutaneous injections of the study drug will be efficacious in decreasing localized fat
      deposits due to the known fat necrosis effects on fat tissue after study drug tissue
      incubation.
