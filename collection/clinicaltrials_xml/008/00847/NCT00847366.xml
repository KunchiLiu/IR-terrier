      Perifosine is an oral anticancer agent with limited toxicity and a novel mechanism of action
      that is distinctly different from cytotoxic chemotherapies. It has been shown to inhibit and
      otherwise modify signaling through a number of pathways including Akt, p21, and JNK.
      Perifosine has been tested in Phase I and Phase II settings in a variety of dosing schedules
      including daily, weekly, and daily following a loading dose. In general, it has been well
      tolerated with dose-related nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue being the most commonly
      observed toxicities.

      Perifosine has induced partial responses or stable disease in solid tumors including but not
      limited to renal cell, sarcoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Perifosine is currently being
      studied in multiple diseases as a single agent as well as in combination with other cancer
      therapies. As studies are closed there are patients that have achieved a partial response or
      stable disease.
