      The aim of this study is to evaluate a simple and rapid method in order to better define and
      treat Polymyalgia Rheumatica by measuring levels of muscle achiness and pain with a blood
      pressure cuff.

      This study is being conducted to evaluate a method for the quantifying of the proximal
      tenderness in patients with presumed diagnosis of Polymyalgia Rheumatica(PMR)using the
      measurements of pain thresholds(in both upper and lower arms) by the use of a standard blood
      pressure cuff.

      At the present time the diagnosis of PMR is based upon four classic criteria, History of
      sudden onset symmetric painful proximal myopathy, Physical demonstrating proximal tenderness
      without loss of motion passively, Laboratory evidence of significant inflammation: ESR&gt;50
      and treatment with a rapidly beneficial response to low dose prednisone.

      While the history, laboratory findings, and the response to prednisone are easily
      documented, the complaint of tenderness and the physical response to that tenderness is
      difficult to define and quantitate.

      By better quantifying the tenderness and the physical response to that tenderness will, it
      is hoped, lead to more rapid diagnosis as well as improved approach to treatment.

      Three groups of patients will be studied. Each patient, after written informed consent and
      procedure statement, will have pain threshold measurements taken and recorded by standard
      blood pressure cuff 4 times: one each on the lower and upper arms. The blood pressure cuff
      will be inflated to the level of maximum pain, then deflated, recording the maximum pain
      level. Absolute numbers will be used for each measurement. Blood pressure will not be
      recorded.

      This study is an attempt to add definition to the diagnosis of Polymyalgia Rheumatica with a
      both simple and rapid office exam.
