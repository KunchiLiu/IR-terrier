      RATIONALE: Breast-conserving surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for breast cancer
      and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying different breast-conserving surgery techniques in
      treating women with breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the percentage of histologically healthy margins maintained during resection
           in women with breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate local recurrence at 5 years.

        -  Evaluate aesthetic results.

        -  Evaluate quality of life using the QLQC30 and BR23 questionnaires.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo oncoplastic conservative surgery according to defined modalities across the
      various centers.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and
      then for at least 3 years.
