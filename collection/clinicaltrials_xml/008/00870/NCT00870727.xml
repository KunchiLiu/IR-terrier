    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a better tolerated and more effective pharmacologic
      treatment with individuals with Pervasive Developmental Disorder. This is a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of aripiprazole in the management of the maladaptive behaviors of
      Pervasive Developmental Disorder. The investigators hypothesize that aripiprazole will be
      more effective than placebo for reducing aggression,tantrum and self-injurious behavior in
      children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder.

    <textblock>
      Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are characterized by severe impairments in social
      interaction and communication in addition to restricted patterns of interests and
      activities. Research suggests that a dysregulation of the dopamine and serotonin systems
      contributes to these interfering behaviors in individuals with PDD. After benefits of
      typical neuroleptics were reported in subjects with PDD, research shifted to the atypical
      antipsychotic which have been shown to be better tolerated and effective in this population.
      However, the atypical antipsychotics have also been associated with adverse effects. Thus
      there remains a need for a novel pharmacotherapy that would be safe and effective for
      children and adolescents with PDD. The primary objectives of this study is to determine
      whether aripiprazole is effective and well tolerated for irritability in children and
      adolescents with PDD NOS during an 8-week acute phase and whether the effectiveness and
      tolerability of aripiprazole is maintained during a 16-week continuation phase.

          -  Psychotropic medication-free for at least 2 days prior to screening laboratory tests
             and electrocardiogram (ECG).

          -  Significant irritability as determined by a Clinical Global Impression Severity of
