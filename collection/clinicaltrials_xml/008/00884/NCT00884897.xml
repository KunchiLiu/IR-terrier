  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Social Cognition and Emotional Intelligence have been shown to be deficient in
      patients with schizophrenia and these are not remediated by antipsychotic medications or
      psychosocial interventions. Social cognition is associated with functional outcome, an
      important step in striving for recovery in this population. The hormone and
      neurotransmitter, oxytocin, which has been associated with social bonding and trust has been
      shown to improve measures of some aspects of social cognition in humans. The study will
      assess the effect of acute administration of intranasal oxytocin on measures of social
      cognition and functioning as well as on emotional intelligence and symptoms.

      Study population: The study population will include patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who have been on a stable medication regimen for 6
      weeks. We will enroll a total of 30 subjects (N=15 placebo and N=15 oxytocin groups).

      Experimental design and methods: After a one week lead in phase, participants will undergo 3
      weeks of oxytocin (20 IU BID) or placebo administration (double blind) in addition to their
      existing medication regimen. Outcome measures will be administered during the lead in phase,
      and at the end of the study drug administration phase (under the acute effect of OT). The
      primary outcome measure will be the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test
      (MSCEIT) and the Maryland Assessment of Social Competence (MASC). Secondary measures include
      rating from the domains of social cognition (emotion perception, attributional style, theory
      of mind and social perception), symptom rating and measures of social anxiety and quality of
      life. Side effects and symptoms will be measured weekly.

    <description>We will purchase OT from PharmaWorld, an international pharmacy located in Switzerland; the preparation of intranasal OT is manufactured by Novartis and sold under the trade name: Syntocinon.

    <description>We will be purchasing oxytocin placebo nasal spray through LABOSWISS located in Davos, Switzerland and distributed through PharmaWorld. LABOSWISS will manufacture the matching the placebo under GDP guidelines. The placebo will be in every way identical to the oxytocin formulation but will not contain OT.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

        All participants must:

          1. Be between age 18 and 55.

          2. Meet DSM-IV criteria for Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder.

          3. Treated with a stabilized antipsychotic regimen (i.e., have had no change in
             antipsychotic medication in the previous six weeks and no change in dose for the past
             30 days).

        Exclusion criteria:

        Participants will be excluded if they have evidence of:

          1. DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence in the last 6 months or DSM-IV criteria for
             abuse in the past 30 days.

          2. Cognitive impairment severe enough to preclude informed consent or valid responses on
             questionnaires. This is defined an as a score of less than 10 on the Evaluation to
             Sign Consent (ESC) and judged by the treating clinician.

          3. Medical illness that in the view of the investigators would compromise participation
             in research.

          4. History of polydipsia and/or hyponatremia

          5. Clinically significant endocrine disorders, as judged by the PI. Abnormalities in
             prolactin levels and thyroid function tests associated with the use of dopamine
             antagonist medications will not be exclusionary.

          6. Pregnancy, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. In addition, women of
             childbearing age are required to use an effective form of birth control for the
             duration of the study. Effective forms of birth control include:

               -  hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, injectable hormones, vaginal ring
                  hormones),

               -  surgical sterility (tubal ligation or hysterectomy)

               -  IUD

               -  Diaphragm with spermicide

               -  Condom with spermicide

               -  Abstinence

          7. Use of any drugs (prostaglandins, vasoconstricting agents or anesthetic medications,
             for example) that may interact with oxytocin. Justification: Avoidance of adverse
             interaction with oxytocin. Assessment tool(s): Clinical interview and toxicology
             screen

          8. History of hypersensitivity to oxytocin or vehicle, i.e. propyl parahydroxybenzoate,
             methyl parahydroxybenzoate, chlorobutanol hemihydrate. Assessment tool: clinical
             interview

          9. Presence of or history of clinically significant allergic rhinitis as assessed by the
             PI, M.D., or Nurse. Justification: Inflammation of nasal mucosa could interfere with
             mucosal absorption of intranasally administered OT. Current rhinitis from an upper
             respiratory infection should be resolved prior to enrollment in study.
