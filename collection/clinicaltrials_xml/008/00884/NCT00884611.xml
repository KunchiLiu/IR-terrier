      This research study, Development of Algorithms for a Hypoglycemic Prevention Alarm, is being
      conducted at Stanford University Medical Center and the University of Colorado Barbara Davis
      Center. It is paid for by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.

      The purpose of doing this research study is to understand the best way to stop an insulin
      infusion pump from delivering insulin to prevent a subject from having hypoglycemia. The
      investigators think that if they take into account how quickly your blood sugar (glucose) is
      dropping we can stop your basal insulin from your pump for 2 hours and keep you from going
      low. The investigators hope that what they learn from this study can be used to set up
      communication between a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump. However, the
      investigators do not currently know the best way to do this.

      The study is expected to include a maximum of 80 people who have type 1 diabetes and are
      between the ages of 12 - 46 years old.

      Your involvement in this research study is expected to take approximately 3-9 months
      depending on your decision to continue using the Navigator Continuous Glucose Monitor.

      Each subject will have one enrollment visit of approximately 2 hours. You will then return
      for one or two 14 hour overnight hospital admissions in the Clinical Research Center (CRC).
      After the CRC visit(s) you will be given the option to continue using a Navigator CGM at
      home for an additional 13 weeks. If you decide to continue use of the Navigator you will be
      scheduled for an additional phone consult or visit to Stanford one week after your hospital
      admission. In addition, you will be required to return to Stanford for a final 13 week
      visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The inclusion criteria for this study includes the following:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and using daily insulin therapy for at least
             one year.

          2. Age 12.0 years to less than 46.0 years old.

          3. Subject has used a downloadable insulin pump for at least 3 months

          4. Parent/guardian and subject understand the study protocol and agree to comply with
             it.

          5. Subjects &gt;12.0 years old and primary care giver (i.e., parent or guardian) comprehend
             written English.

          6. Subject has a home computer with email access.

          7. For females, subject not intending to become pregnant during the study.

          8. No expectation that subject will be moving out of the area of the clinical center
             during the study.

          9. Informed Consent Form signed by the parent/guardian and Child Assent Form signed by
             subjects ages 12 to 17 years.

         10. Subjects cannot have had a severe hypoglycemic event, as described as a seizure, loss
             of consciousness, severe neurological impairment, or neurological impairment
             suggestive of hypoglycemia and requiring an emergency department visit or
             hospitalization within 18 months of enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria for this study is the following:

          1. The presence of a significant medical disorder that in the judgment of the
             investigator will affect the wearing of the sensors or the completion of any aspect
             of the protocol

          2. The presence of any of the following diseases:

               -  Asthma if treated with systemic or inhaled corticosteroids in the last 6 months

               -  Cystic fibrosis

               -  Angina (recurrent heart pain)

               -  Past heart attack or coronary artery (heart vessel) disease

               -  Past stroke or impairment of blood flow to the brain

               -  Other major illness that in the judgment of the investigator might interfere
                  with the completion of the protocol Adequately treated thyroid disease and
                  celiac disease do not exclude subjects from enrollment

          3. Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months for either the subject or the
             subject's primary care giver (i.e., parent or guardian)

             judgment of the investigator would be a contraindication to participation in the
             study
