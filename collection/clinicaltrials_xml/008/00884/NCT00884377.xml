  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study serves to compare the effectiveness of treating cutaneous leishmaniasis with
      either intravenous sodium stibogluconate or direct heat therapy using the ThermoMed-TM
      device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 Department of Defense health care beneficiaries, 18 years of age or older and
      diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis, were planned to be treated with either intravenous
      sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam-TM) or the ThermoMed-TM device of Thermosurgery
      Technologies, Inc. at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Pentostam is the standard of care
      for this disease, but the i.v. administration and the many known side effects prompt the
      search for an improved method of treating this disease, especially for milder cases. This
      study compares the safety and efficacy of these two treatment approached.
