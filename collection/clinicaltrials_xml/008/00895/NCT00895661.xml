  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to see if increased doses of rituximab are safe and
      effective for the initial treatment of indolent B-cell lymphomas. Rituximab (Rituxan) is a
      type of drug called an &quot;antibody&quot; that specifically targets B-cell lymphoma cells, and is
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of indolent B-cell non-hodgkin lymphomas and certain
      other types of non-hodgkin lymphomas. Standard doses currently used may not be achieving
      maximal efficacy. Higher doses have been shown to be safe in other clinical trials, and may
      offer superior efficacy to the current standard dose. This trial also employs intermittent
      maintenance doses of rituximab at the standard dose, which has been shown to prolong
      remissions and survival in patients with relapsed indolent B-cell lymphomas. This trial is
      designed to show that higher dose rituximab plus maintenance rituximab can achieve similarly
      good results to chemotherapy approaches, but without chemotherapy-related toxicity.

      -  All participants will receive increased-dose rituximab through a vein in the arm once a
           week for 4 weeks (on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the initial 28-day study cycle). This
           first cycle of study treatment is called the Induction Phase. If the participant
           responds well to the Induction Phase, they then may continue to the Maintenance Therapy
           Phase, where they will receive a lower dose of rituximab once every three months for up
           to 2 years.

        -  During the Induction Phase, the following procedures will take place before the
           participant receives each dose of rituximab: medical review, physical exam, performance
           status, and ECG. Blood tests will be drawn about 30-60 minutes after the first dose of
           rituximab on Day 1. Samples will be drawn immediately before each dose and again 30-60
           minutes after each dose on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22.

        -  During the Maintenance Therapy Phase, the following procedures will take place before
           the participant receives each dose of rituximab: medical review, physical exam,
           performance status, ECG, blood tests and response assessments by CT scan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Indolent B-Cell NHL of the following histologies:

               1. Follicular lymphoma (grades 1-3A);

               2. marginal zone lymphoma (extranodal, nodal or splenic):

                    -  Extranodal marginal zone lymphomas (MALT lymphomas) may not be candidates
                       for cure with antibiotics or local radiotherapy. Patients who have failed
                       antibiotics or local therapy are eligible for the protocol as long as they
