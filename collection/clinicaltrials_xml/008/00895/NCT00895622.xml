      RATIONALE: Sometimes a tumor may not need treatment until it progresses. In this case,
      observation may be sufficient. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of
      radiation directly to the tumor, such as 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy, may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to
      normal tissue. It is not yet known whether observation is more effective than radiation
      therapy in treating patients with meningioma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying observation to see how well it works compared with
      radiation therapy in treating patients with grade I, grade II, or grade III meningioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the rates of progression-free survival at 3 years in patients with low-risk
           meningioma undergoing observation and in patients with intermediate- or high-risk
           meningioma undergoing radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To study the concordance, or lack thereof, between central and parent institution
           histopathologic diagnosis, grading, and subtyping.

        -  To estimate the rates of overall survival at 3 years in these patients.

        -  To estimate the incidence rates of acute and late adverse events â‰¥ grade 2 in patients
           with intermediate- or high-risk meningioma undergoing radiotherapy.

        -  To evaluate MRI imaging predictors by central neuroradiology review at diagnosis, at
           any failure, and at 3 years.

        -  To evaluate adherence to protocol-specific target and normal tissue radiotherapy
           parameters.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to
      risk.

        -  Group 1 (low-risk disease): Patients undergo observation.

        -  Group 2 (intermediate-risk disease): Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal
           radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily 5 days a week for 6
           weeks.

        -  Group 3 (high-risk disease): Patients undergo IMRT once daily 5 days a week for 6
           weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years
      and then annually for 10 years.
