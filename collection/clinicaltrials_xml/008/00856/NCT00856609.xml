      Background:

        -  Obesity can lead to a number of health problems, including diabetes, heart disease,
           stroke, low back pain, fatty liver disease, and osteoarthritis. The medical treatments
           currently available for obesity are limited.

        -  Exenatide is an injectable medication approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes that
           causes weight loss in some diabetic subjects. If exenatide works for weight loss in
           nondiabetic persons is not known.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether nondiabetic obese individuals treated with exenatide as compared
           with those treated with placebo will lose a greater amount of weight and have body
           composition changes over a 24-week period, and whether the loss and body composition
           changes will be maintained during a 24-week extension period.

        -  To determine whether exenatide leads to a decrease in food intake.

        -  To determine whether change in caloric intake correlates with exenatide-induced changes
           in stomach emptying time.

        -  To determine the effects of exenatide on energy expenditure.

        -  To determine the effects of exenatide on carbohydrate versus fat use by the body for
           energy needs.

        -  To determine the effects of exenatide on activity levels.

        -  To determine whether exenatide alters hormonal levels, and the association of any
           changes with energy intake and expenditure, future weight loss, and percent body fat
           changes.

        -  To determine whether exenatide alters responses to behavioral testing via
           questionnaires specifically addressing dietary restraint and stress-related eating
           behaviors and the relationship of any changes to food intake, hormone levels, weight
           loss, and fat loss.

        -  To assess the tolerability and safety profile of exenatide in nondiabetic obese
           subjects.

      Eligibility:

        -  Nondiabetic men and (premenopausal) women between the ages of 18 and 55 years who have
           a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2) and live in the Phoenix, AZ area.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be admitted for an initial 16-day period to the research unit, during
           which the following will occur:

        -  Instructions on lifestyle changes to promote weight loss

        -  Questionnaires to determine eating-related behaviors and attitudes toward food

        -  Laboratory testing to determine glucose tolerance, body composition, stomach emptying
           time, hormone levels, energy expenditure and food intake both before and after starting
           the study medication

        -  Instructions on self-injecting exenatide or placebo via a medication pen

        -  Instructions on the use of blood glucose monitors and logs

        -  Following release, participants will self-administer a set dose of either exenatide or
           a placebo 2 times per day for 24 weeks. Participants will not know whether they are
           receiving exenatide or placebo.

        -  Outpatient visits occur weekly for the first 4 weeks and then once every 4 weeks,
           during which weight loss, compliance with self-medication, side effects, and lifestyle
           modifications will be assessed.

        -  Participants will be readmitted to the metabolic unit during the 24th week of the
           study, during which the studies from the initial stay will be repeated.

        -  Participants wishing to continue into the 24-week open-label extension period will be
           seen as outpatients as described in the initial part of the study.

      Obesity can lead to a number of health problems including diabetes, heart disease, stroke,
      low back pain, fatty liver disease, and osteoarthritis. The medical treatments currently
      available for obesity are limited. Exenatide is an injectable medication approved for
      treatment of type 2 diabetes that causes weight loss in some diabetic subjects. The reasons
      exenatide is thought to cause weight loss include decreased food intake, increased feelings
      of fullness and nausea. Because levels of a human gut hormone (glucagon like peptide 1) that
      is similar to exenatide have been shown to be related to resting energy expenditure, it is
      also possible that exenatide may have effects on a person s metabolism, a.k.a. energy
      expenditure, but any effect of exenatide on energy expenditure has yet to be evaluated. Even
      though exenatide is used to treat diabetes, administration of exenatide to non-diabetic lean
      individuals did not cause frankly low blood sugars.

      The primary goal of this study is to investigate the way in which exenatide given twice a
      day to obese (BMI &gt;= 30 kg/m^2) people without diabetes might lead to weight loss. Because
      response to weight loss treatment can be highly variable between individuals, we will look
      at the role of exenatide in changing food intake and energy expenditure as possible
      explanations for weight loss. We will also assess the safety profile of exenatide in
      non-diabetic obese people.

      This study will involve the use of exenatide or placebo, determined randomly, in obese
      individuals without diabetes over a 5 week period. The primary measurements will include
      effects of exenatide on energy expenditure and food intake. We will also look at changes in
      body fat and the levels of hormones involved in the sensations of hunger and fullness. We
      will assess if any exenatide-induced changes can predict which individuals lose weight over
      the 5 weeks. The safety and side effects of exenatide in non-diabetic individuals during
      this time will also be determined. Findings from this study would help to determine how
      exenatide works to cause weight loss in people without diabetes, who might benefit most, and
      would help to improve understanding of why some people respond better to weight loss
      treatment than others.
