  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers hope to learn if adding rituximab with high doses of chemotherapy and stem cell
      transplantation will help patients get rid of their lymphoma cells from the bone marrow and
      stem cell collections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the first relapse, patients with follicular type of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may
      have an option to receive high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous (from you) blood
      stem cell transplantation. One of the common causes of relapse is persistence of lymphoma
      cells in the bone marrow and in the collected stem cell products.

      Patients who do not have a complete response after traditional chemotherapy, have a greater
      chance of the lymphoma returning even after receiving high dose chemotherapy with stem cell
      transplantation. In order to improve the response and decrease the relapse rate, additional
      therapy may be used to kill the lymphoma cells by using antibodies both before and after the
      transplantation. Antibodies are protein made by white cells in our body to fight off
      infection and sometimes tumor. Rituxan (rituximab) is an antibody that is effective against
      your type of lymphoma. Researchers have reported that patients show an improved response and
      a lower chance of relapse when using rituximab with high dose chemotherapy with autologous
      stem cell transplantation. It is unknown how effective rituximab is in clearing persistence
      of minimal remaining disease in patients with follicular lymphoma.

    <description>Patients will be treated IV with rituximab at the rate of 50 mg/hour for 1 hour. If patient tolerates the infusion, the rate is increased by increments of 50 mg/hour every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hour. If patient has a severe reaction, the infusion is stopped temporarily and the infusion rate is decreased by 50%. Subsequent infusions are started at the rate of 100 mg/hour, increased by 100 mg/hour every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hour if tolerated. Vital signs are monitored every 15 minutes for 2 hours and every 30 minutes thereafter.</description>
