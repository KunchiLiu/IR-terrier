      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor samples from women who have undergone
      chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To identify gene sets for risk of recurrence using molecular profiling in samples from
           women with lymph node-positive or high-risk lymph node-negative breast cancer on
           clinical trial ECOG-E2197.

      Secondary

        -  To define a set of significant genes as prognostic markers of recurrence.

        -  To compare the prognostic value of the Oncotype DX™ (ODX) 21 gene assay of clinical
           trial with gene sets determined in this study.

        -  To compare the DASL™ assay of the ODX 21 genes with ODX assay results of clinical
           trial.

        -  To compare the prognostic value of selected genes with gene sets determined in this
           study.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Samples are used in molecular profiling by applying a custom panel of breast cancer-related
      genes to a cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, Extension, and Ligation (DASL™) assay,
      immunohistochemistry, and other studies.
