  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are testing to see if Galantamine, a learning enhancing medication, will help methadone
      maintained cocaine abusers with their learning and memory specific to CBT using an
      innovative CBT computer program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are proposing a randomized double blind clinical trial of galantamine and our innovative
      computer-assisted version of CBT, alone and in combination, to improve treatment outcome and
      cognitive functioning among cocaine users. The proposed study will be the first to evaluate
      a cognitive enhancing medication as a means of enhancing the effects of an extremely
      promising empirically validated behavioral therapy for addiction, and hence bridge cognitive
      neuroscience and behavioral therapies development.

      The aim is to conduct a 12 week randomized placebo controlled trial, using a 2x2 factorial
      model, that will evaluate the efficacy of adding computer assisted training in CBT
      (&quot;CBT4CBT&quot;) and galantamine to standard treatment for 160 cocaine abusing or dependent
      methadone-maintained individuals. Participants will be randomized to (1) standard treatment
      (TAU) plus placebo, (2) TAU plus galantamine, (3) TAU plus CBT4CBT plus placebo, or (4) TAU
      plus CBT4CBT plus galantamine.

    <description>A composite using a carefully selected neuropsychological battery that includes measures of executive cognitive functioning frequently affected among cocaine users, likely to be important moderators of CBT4CBT, and sensitive to galantamine effects. These will include measures of multiple aspects of attention, memory, and inhibitory control (CANTAB) cognitive inhibition (classic Stroop), sustained attention (CPT), decision making (EDT, MIDT and BART), and attentional bias (cocaine Stroop).</description>

    <description>Standard Treatment plus placebo for cocaine abusing or dependent methadone-maintained individuals. This consists of daily methadone visits plus one individual and one group session per week, and patients may participate in additional treatments such as HIV education and treatment. The counseling program's theoretical orientation is described as client-centered.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Standard treatment plus Galantamine. In this study, we will use 8 mg galantamine extended release (ER). Galantamine ER is used once daily. The recommended initial dose is 8 mg/day and the maintenance dose is 16-24 mg/day.</description>

All participants assigned to this condition will also be offered up to 60 minutes per week to work with the CBT for CBT program, onsite at the clinic, in a private space and using a computer provided by the research project. Patients will have the choice of how they choose to use the computer, that is, in two 30-minute sessions or one one-hour session.</description>
