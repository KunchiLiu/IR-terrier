  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the investigational study product and
      see how well it works to relieve signs and symptoms of children with mild to moderate Atopic
      Dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, in comparison to that of a similar marketed product.
      This study is being done to see how safe the investigational new study product is and how
      well it will work to treat AD in children, by making AD visually better, and reducing the
      amount of itch.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial in children 2 to
      12 years of age with mild to moderate AD. A sufficient number of subjects will be screened
      to ensure that approximately 80 subjects are randomized, to yield 70 completed subjects.
      Subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups: the J&amp;J Device or
      Atopiclair®. All subjects will return to the clinical site for clinical assessments at
      baseline (Day 1) and at Days 3, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 43 after initial investigational product
      application. The investigational products will be used topically during the duration of the
      study.
