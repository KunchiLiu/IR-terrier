      The purpose of this study is to is to test increasing repeat doses of GSK249320 compared to
      placebo in patients with stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK249320 is a humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high specificity to
      myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and antagonises or neutralises MAG-mediated inhibition
      and has been shown to improve functional recovery after stroke in pre-clinical models,
      possibly by promoting neuroregeneration and plasticity. The present study is the first in
      patients with stroke. The main aim of this study is to select tolerated doses of GSK249320
      that can be used in future trials to evaluate its efficacy in improving clinical function in
      patients recovering from stroke. This clinical trial is designed as a placebo-controlled,
      single-blind, multicenter study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of escalating repeat IV doses of GSK249320. Three sequential dose
      escalation cohorts (1, 5 and 15 mg/kg) are planned, with 8 patients on placebo and 8 on
      active in cohort 1 and 4 patients on placebo and 8 on active in cohorts 2 and 3. Each
      patient will receive 2 repeat IV doses 9 ± 1 days apart and assessments will extend to at
      least 16 weeks.

          -  Stroke onset must be within the last 24-72 hours.

          -  Have a stroke that is either:

          -  radiologically confirmed to be ischaemic and supratentorial. The diameter of the
             ischemic lesion is &gt;15mm in any singlle direction or the volume is &gt;4cc. OR

          -  radiologically confirmed to be an intracerebral hemorrhage that is supratentorial,
             deep (i.e., blood must not directly contact cerebral cortex) and with minimal or no
             intraventricular extension. The Intracerebral Hemorrahage (CH) score must be 0-2 and
             is calculated based on age, Galsgow coma Scale score ad the initial CT or MRI
             findings for the index stroke. See the SOM for the full calculation procedure.

          -  Have a total NIHSS score of 3-21.

          -  Have an upper and/or lower limb deficit defined as:

          -  Score of 1-3 on the NIHSS Motor Arm question, and palpable and observable voluntary
             extension or flexion of the fingers. AND/OR b. Score of 1-3 on the NIHSS Motor Leg
