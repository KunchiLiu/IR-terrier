    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition in which the upper chambers of the heart, the atria,
      undergo an irregular beating rhythm. Despite the fact that AF is the most common type of
      sustained cardiac rhythm disturbance the investigators still do not understand it entirely
      and its current therapies are only marginally effective. The overall goal of our project is
      to determine the organization and mechanisms of electrical activation patterns during AF in
      humans.

    <textblock>
      Experiments in animal hearts demonstrated that some cases of atrial fibrillation (AF) may be
      maintained by a small number of drivers in the form of self-sustained, reentrant, electrical
      impulses located in the posterior left atrium (LA) wall, near the pulmonary veins (PV/LA
      junction). In those experiments, the fastest rotors acted as the highest frequency drivers
      that maintained the overall activity. This resulted in a hierarchy of local excitation
      frequencies throughout both atria. More recently, clinical studies have confirmed the
      existence of a hierarchical organization in the rate of activation of different regions in
      the atria of patients with paroxysmal and chronic atrial fibrillation. However, the
      mechanisms underlying such a hierarchical distribution of frequencies in human AF has not
      been explored. Our project will try to demonstrate the general hypothesis that both local
      activation frequency and degree of regularity, while different in different parts of the
      atrium, are distributed non-randomly, with different patterns of distribution in paroxysmal
      versus chronic AF patients. We further surmise that such patterns are the result of
      interrupted propagation of impulses emanating from the drivers localized at the site of
      highest frequency and organization activity, with a gradual reduction of activation
      frequency as the distance from the driver increases. To test our hypotheses we will use a
      combination of clinical and numerical studies. For the clinical part we will gather patients
      data in two collaborative sites at Bordeaux, France and Rochester, NY. The data obtained in
      those sites will be analyzed and interpreted at the Institute for Cardiovascular Research in
      SUNY Upstate Medical University. For the numerical part, simulations on computer models of
      AF will be performed solely in the Institute for Cardiovascular Research. Our Specific Aims
      are: 1. In patients with paroxysmal and chronic AF, to quantify with high resolution the
      rate and regularity of the electrical signals during AF. A novel online device will allow
      mapping with great details particular areas of interest with minimal increase in risk to the
      patients. 2. Characterize the frequency of activation during AF in patients after heart
      surgery and relate it to the presence of fibrosis. 3. In paroxysmal AF patients, to
      determine the &quot;breakdown frequency&quot; at which rapid pacing in the presence and the absence of
      adenosine results in wavefront fragmentation, reflected by a sudden change from continuous
      to interrupted activation. 3. In computer simulations, to study the mechanisms of initiation
      and maintenance of AF at the PV/LA junction using three different computer models with
      increasing anatomical complexity (the description of the computer simulations is available
      only in the grant application). Successful achievement of our specific aims should help us
      advance understanding of the mechanisms and manifestations of this complex arrhythmia and
      may help to directly improve the efficacy of pharmacological and ablative therapies of AF in
      patients.
