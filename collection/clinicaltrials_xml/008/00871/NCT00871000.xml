      This phase 3b study will compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the dTpa-IPV
      vaccine to that of a DTPa-IPV vaccine when administered as a booster dose in healthy
      children 5-6 years of age who have received three primary vaccination doses of DTPa-based
      vaccine according to the &quot;3-5-11&quot; month schedule recommended in Italy.

      In this study, MMRV vaccine will also be co-administered to all children.

          -  Subjects who received a complete 3-dose vaccination with a DTPa-based combined
             vaccine according to a 3-5-11 month schedule in line with recommendations in Italy.

          -  Subjects who received a first dose of a live attenuated measles-mumps-rubella vaccine
             in the second year of life, in line with recommendations in Italy.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will
             comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study.

             earlier immunisation against diphtheria and/or tetanus.

          -  Occurrence of any of the following adverse events after a previous administration of
             a DTP vaccine:

               -  Hypersensitivity reaction to any component of the vaccine;

               -  Encephalopathy of unknown aetiology occurring within 7 days following previous
                  vaccination with pertussis-containing vaccine;

               -  Fever &gt;= 40°C within 48 hours of vaccination, not due to another identifiable
                  cause;

               -  Collapse or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination;

               -  Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.

          -  Residence in the same household as a person high risk for varicella

          -  The following condition is temporary or self-limiting, and a subject may be
             vaccinated once the condition has resolved if no other exclusion criteria is met:

               -  Current febrile illness or axillary temperature ≥ 38.5 ºC or other moderate to
                  severe illness within 24 hours of study vaccine administration.
