  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ten to 50% of women with gestational diabetes (GDM), or glucose intolerance first recognized
      during pregnancy, develop diabetes within 5 years after delivery. Although intensive
      interventions can reduce diabetes incidence in women with impaired glucose tolerance, it is
      unknown if such strategies would be effective in women with GDM. Women with recent GDM, even
      though no longer pregnant, face significant barriers to lifestyle modification, including
      caregiving responsibilities and low perception of risk. Web-based programs can reinforce
      physical activity through visual feedback of pedometer output, tailored messaging,
      education, and on-line communities. Such a program is currently available for adults with
      chronic disease and is led by Dr. Richardson, a co-PI on this application. Using data from
      focus group and survey work conducted by Dr. Kim, the other co-PI, this program can be
      modified to women with recent GDM. For Specific Aim 1, we propose to adapt a chronic disease
      web-based pedometer program to women with recent GDM. For Specific Aim 2, we propose to
      conduct a pilot and feasibility study of the program. The intervention will last 12 weeks.
