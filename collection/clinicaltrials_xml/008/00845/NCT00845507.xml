    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and efficacy (how well it works) of
      exenatide as a treatment for weight gain associated with olanzapine in obese adults with
      Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder

      Exenatide has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.

      It has not been approved for the treatment of weight gain associated with olanzapine in
      obese adults with bipolar disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia or
      Schizoaffective Disorder

      Double-blind studies suggest that olanzapine is highly effective for the treatment of
      individuals with bipolar disorder. However, weight gain and impaired glucose tolerance
      remain significant concerns associated with olanzapine. Exenatide is an anti-diabetic
      medication that is associated with weight loss and improved glucose regulation. Therefore,
      the overall goal of the proposed study is to conduct a 16-week double-blind
      placebo-controlled study of exenatide for the treatment of weight gain associated with
      olanzapine in 60 obese adults with bipolar disorder treated with olanzapine. We propose to
      conduct the study over the course of 24 months, with an expected enrollment of approximately
      3 patients per month. The primary outcome measure will be change from baseline to endpoint
      in weight. The secondary outcome measures will include changes from baseline to endpoint, in
      body mass index (BMI), abdominal circumference, metabolic parameters, clinical global
      improvement of psychiatric symptoms, and change in manic, depressive and psychotic symptoms.
      Rates of adverse events also will be assessed.
