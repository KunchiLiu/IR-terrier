    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  evaluate the safety profile of a single intravenous administration of AIGIV (containing
           either 3.5 mg/kg, 7.0 mg/kg or 14.0 mg/kg anti-PA IgG) as compared with either 90
           mg/kg, 180 mg/kg or 360 mg/kg total IgG, GAMUNEX(R)(immune globulin intravenous (human)
           10% caprylate/chromatography purified). GAMUNEX is a trademark of Talecris
           Biotherapeutics.

        -  evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single intravenous administration of
           AIGIV (containing either 3.5 mg/kg, 7.0 mg/kg or 14.0 mg/kg anti-PA IgG) as measured by
           lethal toxin neutralizing antibody (TNA).
