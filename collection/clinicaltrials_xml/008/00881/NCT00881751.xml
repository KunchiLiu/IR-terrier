      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Erlotinib and sorafenib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Bevacizumab, erlotinib, and sorafenib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving bevacizumab together with
      erlotinib is more effective than giving sorafenib in treating patients with liver cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together
      with erlotinib works compared with sorafenib as first-line therapy in treating patients with
      advanced liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the overall survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
           treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride vs sorafenib tosylate.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the event-free survival and tumor response rate of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and oral
           erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. In both
           arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 1 year.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to estimate clinical efficacy outcomes (based on OS) of patients treated with B+E and patients treated with S. Forty-five patients in each arm who are evaluable for response will be sufficient for this analysis. A patient is evaluable for response if one 28-day cycle of therapy is completed. Enrolled patients who are not evaluable will be replaced, so there will be 45 patients in each arm evaluable for response.</description>
