      The aim of the study is to compare a multidisciplinary examination and follow up by
      rehabilitation program with a multidisciplinary examination, good advice and follow up by
      the family doctor.

      Further on we will examine if there were differing clinical characteristics between patients
      who attended a planned follow-up session and those that failed to and Prognostic factors in
      mild traumatic brain injury patients after discharge from hospital.

      2 months after an acute mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) defined as Glasgow Coma Scale
      between 13 and 15. The patient will get a clinical examination by a specialist in
      rehabilitation medicine. Patient who wish or need a further follow up, are out of work or
      school, will be included and randomized to either a multidisciplinary follow up or primary
      care follow by their family doctor.

      Both groups will got a multidisciplinary examination. The multidisciplinary team will work
      out a rehabilitation program and a report back to their family doctor.

      Patient who got a multidisciplinary follow up will then get individual appointments and they
      will follow an educational program for 4 days. The topics are physical and psychical
      problems after TBI and problems in daily living and return to work. We will teach a way to
      accept and deal with their problems. A cognitive behavioural treatment or a psycho educative
      approach will be central in the treatment. The follow up period will be until 2 years if
      needed.

      For booth groups we will make a registration of sick leave for 5 years. The Extended Glasgow
      Outcome Scale (GOS- E), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), Rivermead post
      concussion symptoms questionnaire and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) after 6 and
      12 months.

      Department of Economics at the University of Bergen will make cost-benefit analysis.

      Further on we will examine if there were differing clinical characteristics between patients
      who attended a planned follow-up session and those that failed to, if sick leave or return
      to work could make a difference and Prognostic factors in mild traumatic brain injury
      patients after discharge from hospital. We also include demographic data, CT findings and
      clinical data based on information from the medical records, pain drawings and numeric
      rating scale for pain, Quality of Life and Subjective Health Complaints inventory. We got
      data about days on sick leave, diagnosis for sick leave and income for the first year before
      and after the injury from The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Service (NAV) through a third
      accredited agency Statistics Norway. From Statistics Norway we got additional information
      about education level and income.
