  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is a prospective, randomized, cross-over study that is being done to compare
      the effect of morning only, evening only and twice daily insulin glargine (LantusÂ®) on
      hypoglycemia (blood glucose level &lt;70 mg/dL) as measured by continuous glucose monitoring
      (CGM) in patients with type 1 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the course of the 6 week study, patients will take insulin glargine in each of 3
      different times: only in the morning, only at night, and half in the morning, half at night.
      After 2 weeks taking the insulin in one regimen, patients will be switched to another
      regimen. Through the whole study, patients will be injecting themselves twice daily, and
      neither the patient nor the treating doctor will know which vials contain the insulin and
      which have only saline (placebo). The vials will be labeled MORNING or EVENING. Patients
      will continue to take their mealtime, short acting insulin doses.

      Additionally, patients will wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) which will be masked.
      Before the study, patients will be taught about how to use the CGM, and keep it taped to
      their abdomen. The site that the CGM inserts into their abdomen will need to be changed
      every 5 days. We will know if a patients' blood sugar goes low even if the patient did not
      feel the low. Patients will still have to self-monitor their blood sugar levels at-least
      four times in five days, to calibrate the CGM.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult men and women above age 18 with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus

          -  On multiple insulin injections, including a long acting or intermediate acting
             insulin preparation and mealtime short acting insulin preparation.

          -  Clinical history consistent with hypoglycemia

          -  Hba1c &lt;9.0%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  Patients on insulin pump

          -  Poor control of diabetes (HbA1c &gt; 9.0%)

          -  Pregnancy (women of childbearing age will undergo a pregnancy test at the start of
             the study and will be advised to use birth control methods during the study). Insulin
             glargine has been reported to have teratogenic effects in animal models, and
             therefore should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.

          -  Serious co-morbidities that, in clinical opinion of the investigators, could affect
             pharmacokinetics of glargine (e.g., CRF) or safety (e.g., recent CAD)
