    <textblock>
      The purpose of the pivotal IDE clinical study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
      of the SECURE®-C Cervical Artificial Disc for the treatment of symptomatic cervical disc
      disease at one level between C3 and C7, compared to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.

      The purpose of the Postmarket Approval Study is to evaluate the long-term safety and
      efficacy associated with the use of the SECURE-C Cervical Artificial Disc

          -  Loss of disc height.

          -  Age between 18 and 60 years

          -  Failed at least 6 weeks of conservative treatment

          -  Neck Disability Index (NDI) Questionnaire score of at least 30 (as percentage of 50

          -  Prior surgery at the level to be treated

          -  Clinically compromised vertebral bodies at the affected level(s) due to current or
             past trauma

          -  Radiographic confirmation of facet joint disease or degeneration, defined as apparent
             sclerosis and/or hypertrophy of the facets demonstrated on AP radiographs as a
