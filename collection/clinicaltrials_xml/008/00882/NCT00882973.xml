    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II
      dose of the combination therapy with Genexol-PM and gemcitabine (hereafter Genexol-PM plus
      gemcitabine) and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Genexol-PM regimens (monotherapy and
      combination with gemcitabine) and gemcitabine monotherapy in subjects with locally advanced
      or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who aged 18 years or older

          2. Subjects whose written informed consent was obtained complying with the local
             regulatory requirements prior to their participation in the trial

          3. Subjects who have histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or
             metastatic epithelial cancer of the exocrine pancreas. High-quality contrast-enhanced
             CT scanning is required to evaluate resectability. Measurable disease is not
             required.

          4. Subjects with no other malignancy diagnosed within past five years except for:

               -  Cured non-melanoma skin cancer

               -  Cured cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)

               -  Cured In-situ cervical cancer (CIS)

          5. Subjects who are ECOG performance status of â‰¤ 1
