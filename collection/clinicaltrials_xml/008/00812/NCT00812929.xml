      This study is intended to determine the dose response and duration of action of GSK2190915
      in mild asthmatic adult subjects who experience exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
      Subjects will be invited to complete a screening visit, during which time exercise induced
      bronchoconstriction must be demonstrated, defined as a decrease between 20-40% in FEV1
      compared to baseline immediately following exercise challenge. Eligible subjects will
      complete a randomized, double-blind, five-way crossover study. Subjects will be randomized
      to a single dose of either 10 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg GSK2190915, or placebo during each
      treatment period. Each treatment period will last 2 days and will include various
      assessments following exercise challenge at 2, 9.5, and 24 hours post dose. A minimum 7 day
      washout between treatment periods will be required. Regardless if a subject completes or
      prematurely withdraws from the study, a follow up visit will be completed 7-21 days
      following last dose.
