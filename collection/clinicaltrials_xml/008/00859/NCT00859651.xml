  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study which will enroll 20 postmenopausal women who are at high risk for
      breast cancer development. The goal is to determine whether a one-year intervention of
      high-dose vitamin D at 2 different doses (20,000 IU weekly or 30,000 IU weekly) will
      increase circulating blood levels of vitamin D and to obtain preliminary data on the
      biologic effects of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.

      Participants will receive oral vitamin D3, cholecalciferol 20,000 IU or 30,000 IU weekly.
      Before beginning the intervention, the participants will have a general physical exam
      including a clinical breast exam and anthropometric measures, a morning blood draw (for
      analysis of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)D, PTH, IGF-I, IGFBP-3, estradiol, estrone, testosterone, and
      SHBG at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months) and a bilateral mammogram (at baseline and 12
      months). Participants will also complete a baseline questionnaire, collecting data on
      demographic information and breast cancer risk factors. In addition, we will be collecting
      data on vitamin D sources from diet and sunlight exposure using a validated questionnaire
      administered at baseline and 12 months.

      For follow-up visits, the participant will be seen at the study site at months 3, 6, 9, and
      12. During these visits, drug will be dispensed, adherence ascertained, and adverse events
      will also be assessed. In addition, blood (serum calcium, albumin, creatinine) and urine
      (urine calcium, creatinine) will be collected to monitor for toxicity. A 24-hour urine
      collection will be conducted at baseline and 12 months to assess for hypercalciuria. After
      the 1 year intervention, all participants will have a complete physical exam including
      clinical breast exam, a bilateral mammogram, blood draw, and complete a follow-up
      questionnaire.

             in situ, (3) Known BRCA1 or BRCA2 deleterious mutation carrier, (4) Prior history of
             ductal carcinoma in situ, if no current tamoxifen use or prior radiation to the
