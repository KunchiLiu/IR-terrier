  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by temporary stops in breathing during
      sleep and has been associated with the development of cardiovascular disease. This research
      will investigate one potential mechanism leading to the development of cardiovascular
      disorder, specifically, the blockage of blood vessels called &quot;vascular occlusion&quot;, in
      subjects with sleep apnea. A group of healthy controls will be used for comparison. All
      subjects will undergo clinical evaluation followed by an overnight sleep study and a morning
      blood draw. Subjects with sleep apnea will be treated according to standard clinical
      management and followed under the research protocol for one month. At the end of one month,
      a repeat blood draw will be performed on the sleep apnea subjects for comparative analysis.
      If a control subject is found to have any abnormality during this research study, he or she
      will be referred for further clinical evaluation.

      The importance of this project is to investigate mechanisms of vascular disease in sleep
      apnea and determine pathways for intervention, aiming to prevent the development of
      cardiovascular disease in these individuals.

      This proposed research aims to evaluate both NTPDase activity in lymphocytes and levels of
      circulating endothelial cells (CECs) in patients with intermittent hypoxemia (IH) due to
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and healthy controls. This is an original approach to define
      mechanisms which underlie the high incidence of occlusive vascular events in patients with
      OSA. The evaluation of such pathophysiological mechanisms will lead to a better
      understanding of the pathways involved and the development of therapeutic strategies
      targeting the reduction or avoidance of endothelial injury with the ultimate goal of
      reducing morbidity and mortality associated with these pathologic events in sleep apnea. The
      standard of care will be used in this protocol, which involves the use of CPAP (continuous
      positive airway pressure) for treating sleep apnea.

    <description>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a method of respiratory ventilation which is accepted as the gold standard to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Subjects found to have OSA after the Nocturnal Polysomnography (NPSG) will be trained in the use of CPAP and will be instructed to use CPAP every night for 30 nights. These subjects will then return for a post-treatment blood draw.</description>
