      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride
      and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood
      flow to the cancer. Giving pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride together with
      bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin hydrochloride together with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone and
      to see how well it works in treating patients with multiple myeloma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine efficacy of this novel combination in newly diagnosed patients with multiple
      myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity of this novel combination regimen in previously treated
      patients and newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) or orally (PO) over 1 hour, bortezomib
      IV over 3 minutes, and dexamethasone IV or PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on day 8. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
