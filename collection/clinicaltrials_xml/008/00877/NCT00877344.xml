      Hypothesis

      Intrauterine contraception placed immediately after a second trimester abortion will result
      in fewer pregnancies than current standard practice of intended placement at 4 weeks
      post-abortion.

      Study Design

      Randomized Controlled Trial after their second trimester abortion comparing immediate with
      delayed insertion of IUC, and a non intervention control group choosing non-intrauterine
      contraception. Participants choosing an IUC will be randomly assigned to immediate or
      delayed insertion. The investigators primary outcome is pregnancy rate within one year.

      This Randomized Controlled Trial will be offered to women choosing to have a LNG-IUC or
      CuT380 after an abortion for gestational ages from 12 to 24 weeks. [delete next insert]&quot;and
      a non intervention control group offered to all others having abortions at this gestational
      age&quot;. Participants choosing an LNG-IUC or CUT380 will be randomly assigned to immediate or
      interval insertion. In conjunction with follow up visits and questionnaires, the British
      Columbia Linked Health Database access will determine pregnancy rate within one year for the
      two intervention groups [delete next insert] and in relation to the various contraceptive
      choices made by the women not choosing intrauterine contraception. All women will complete
      surveys at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 months on their satisfaction with the contraceptive
      method chosen and on their satisfaction with study participation.
