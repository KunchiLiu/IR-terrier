  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a significant clinical, social, and economic issue.
      Studies in animals have allowed us to identify mechanisms contributing to NIHL, including
      direct mechanical trauma, free radicals formed in association with metabolic stress, and
      reduced blood flow. A combination of antioxidant vitamins (beta-carotene, and vitamins C and
      E) and the mineral magnesium (which acts in part as a vasodilator but also as an
      antioxidant) is highly effective in preventing NIHL in animals. These studies evaluate
      efficacy of this intervention in humans.

      Hypothesis: Treatment with these micronutrients provides safe, effective attenuation of
      acute hearing changes induced by exposure to real-world sounds producing temporary
      (non-permanent) or permanent hearing changes induced by exposure to real-world sounds.

      Experiment 1: &quot;Digital Audio Player&quot; studies (University of Florida, Gainesville).
      Prevention of *temporary* elevations in hearing thresholds, induced by exposure to
      moderately loud music, will be measured. Subjects will be 70 young adults with equal numbers
      of male and female participants.

      Experiment 2: &quot;Urban warfare&quot; military studies (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden). Prevention
      of *temporary* elevations in hearing thresholds, induced by automatic gunfire sound inside a
      concrete bunker, will be measured. Subjects will be 31 adult male or female officers in the
      Swedish army required to participate in urban combat training regardless of study
      participation. All subjects are required to wear standard hearing protection during combat
      exercises.
