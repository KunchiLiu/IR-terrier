      Blood samples were drawn from patients with Gaucher disease and healthy individuals, with
      and without HCV. Blood samples were tested for protein specific T cell proliferation, IFNg
      and IL-10 using ELISPOT assays, serum IFNg, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-4 levels. FACS analysis
      was used for evaluation of lymphocytes subsets.
