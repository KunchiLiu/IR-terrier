      Background:

        -  Researchers have studied the causes of fatigue during treatments for various diseases,
           but these results have not been conclusive.

        -  More information on the physical changes that affect the body during treatment may help
           identify biological or chemical factors that contribute to patient fatigue, which may
           allow physicians to identify individuals who may be more at risk of feeling fatigue
           before, during, and after treatment for diseases such as cancer.

      Objectives:

        -  To identify factors contributing to fatigue in men who are undergoing radiation
           treatment for prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Men 18 years of age and older who are scheduled to receive localized radiation
           treatment for prostate cancer.

      Design:

        -  Six outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center, approximately on the same day and
           same time of day:

        -  First visit before beginning radiation treatment.

        -  Once a week for the first 2 weeks of the treatment, once at the midpoint of treatment,
           once at the end of treatment.

        -  Final visit 4 weeks after completion of radiation treatment.

        -  Initial visit will involve a physical examination and questions about medical history.

        -  Evaluations during the treatment period:

        -  Blood draws to identify cells and chemicals associated with inflammation and fatigue.

        -  Questions about physical activity, fatigue, depression, and quality of life.

      Although the underlying mechanisms of fatigue have been studied in several disease
      conditions the data are not conclusive, and this symptom remains poorly managed at present.
      Longitudinal studies related to treatment-related fatigue in prostate cancer patients have
      been conducted, but there are limited studies exploring the changes in physiologic
      mechanisms before and after radiotherapy which can identify individuals who are at risk for
      enduring fatigue during and after therapy. Fatigue is conceptualized as a multidimensional
      symptom which incorporates temporal, sensory, cognitive/mental, affective/emotional,
      behavioral, and physiological dimensions.This prospective, observational study is the first
      study to explore the molecular-genetic mechanisms underlying fatigue and the cluster of
      symptoms (urinary, sexual, gastrointestinal, psychiatric) experienced by prostate cancer
      patients undergoing External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT).

      The primary objective of the study is to describe the changes in the self-reported fatigue;
      urinary, sexual, and gastrointestinal symptoms; depression; fatigue catastrophizing; and
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) experienced by patients with and without prostate
      surgery before, during, and after EBRT completion. The secondary objectives of this study
      are to investigate the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile of EBRT-related fatigue (TNF ,
      IGF-I, IL-6, IL-8, TGF and (SqrRoot) ) determine changes in white blood cell gene expression
      using buffy coat collection to determine levels of oxidative stress and changes in potential
      biomarkers influencing oxidative stress from blood and buccal samples before, during, and
      after EBRT completion and to relate these changes in the levels of these biological markers
      to self-reported fatigue; urinary, sexual, and gastrointestinal symptoms; depression;
      fatigue catastrophizing; and HRQOL scores. This study also aims to measure the skeletal
      muscle strength, activity/fitness levels, cognitive function and energy expenditure of
      patients before, during, at completion of EBRT, and at least 6 months post EBRT and relate
      these findings with self-reported fatigue, physical symptoms (e.g. urinary,
      gastrointestinal, and sexual functioning), depression, and HRQOL scores before and after an
      exercise training program. The study also aims to describe changes in chemical profile in
      the brain that are associated with changes in fatigue symptoms using magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy before and during EBRT.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be included, patients must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Clinically localized prostate cancer with or without prior prostatectomy;

          -  Scheduled to receive EBRT either by 3D conformal or IMRT techniques that is not
             anticipated to change during the course of the study, with or without ADT;

          -  No known medical history of tuberculosis (TB);

          -  Able to provide written informed consent by passing at least 80% of the consent quiz;

          -  Men greater than or equal to18 years of age;

        The control group must meet all the inclusion criteria mentioned above except for number
        2. The control group must not be receiving any form of treatment for their prostate cancer
        to include hormone, immune, radiation, or chemotherapy.

        All participants with any one of the following criteria will be excluded:

        Progressive or unstable disease of any body system causing clinically significant fatigue,
