    <textblock>
      Octagam is a human normal immunoglobulin (IGIV) solution for intravenous administration.
      Octagam 5% is currently registered in more than 60 countries. This study will evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and the kinetics of Octagam 10% for replacement therapy in primary
      immunodeficiency diseases.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety of Octagam 10% in
      replacement therapy in PID and to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of Octagam 10% with
      that of the previously used Octagam 5%.

      The secondary objective is to investigate the efficacy of Octagam 10% in replacement therapy
      in PID by monitoring the rate of occurence of serious bacterial infections, the rate of
      other infections, the trough (pre-next-dose) levels of total serum IgG and IgG subclasses
      (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4), the trough (pre-next-dose) levels of selected antigen specific
      antibodies, the use of antibiotics, the rate of absence from school/ work, and the number of
      days in hospital.
