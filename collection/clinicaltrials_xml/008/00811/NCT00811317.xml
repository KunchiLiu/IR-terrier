  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that our integrated closed-loop glucose-control system can provide effective,
      tight, and safe blood glucose (BG) control in type 1 diabetes, thereby establishing the
      feasibility of closed-loop BG control.

      This study investigates the utility of an integrated closed-loop glucose-control system for
      regulating BG in type 1 diabetic subjects. The closed-loop system utilizes sub-cutaneous
      infusion or insulin and glucagon under the control of a computer algorithm. The only inputs
      to the algorithm are the subject weight and BG values measured every five minutes. Subjects
      will undergo up to three 27 hour GCRC admissions during which they will consume three
      standardized meals. Subject may participate in up to two closed-loop visits (with different
      insulin lispro pharmacokinetic parameter settings in the control algorithm) and some
      subjects will participate in open-loop visits. During the closed-loop admission BG will be
      controlled by the closed-loop system. During the open-loop visit subjects will regulate
      their own BG in the usual function using their insulin pumps. A small group of non-diabetic
      subjects will undergo a single 27 hour GCRC admission during which they will eat the same
      standardized meals. During all admission BG will be measured every 5 minutes and blood will
      be collected for measurement of insulin and glucagon levels every 10 minutes. During the
      closed-loop admission of diabetic subjects and the single admission of non-diabetic
      subjects, three commercially available continuous glucose monitoring devices will be worn.
      The data from these devices will later be compared to reference BG data.
