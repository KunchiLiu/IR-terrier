    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of clofarabine when given
      together with cytarabine and to see how well they work in treating older patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that have relapsed or
      not responded to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as clofarabine and cytarabine,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving clofarabine together with cytarabine may kill more
      cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral clofarabine when given with LDAC
      (cytarabine) in patients age &gt;= 60 with previously treated AML or high risk MDS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS)
      after therapy with oral clofarabine and LDAC for previously treated AML or high-risk MDS.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of clofarabine followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive clofarabine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and low-dose cytarabine
      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10 or SC QD on days 1-14. Treatment repeats
      every 21-28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.

    <description>Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) consists of grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity at least possibly related to study drug. Exceptions include neutropenic fever; drug-related fever; alopecia; anorexia; inadequately treated nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea; and grade 3/4 increase in ALT, AST, or bilirubin recovering to &lt; grade 2 by 7 days. Prolonged grade 2 myelosuppression lasting longer than 49 days in patients who don't proceed to additional cytotoxic therapy is considered a DLT. The MTD or recommended phase II dose is the highest dose level at which no more than 1 patient out of 6 experiences DLT.</description>
