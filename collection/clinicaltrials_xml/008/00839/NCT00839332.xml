      The purpose of the Phase 1 portion of this study is to determine the safe dose of LY2603618
      when given 24 hours after gemcitabine. This dose will then be used for the Phase 2 portion
      of the study. The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate whether LY2603618 when
      administered 24 hours after gemcitabine therapy is an effective treatment for patients with
      pancreatic cancer.

      Phase 1 will be a dose escalation of doses 70 mg/m2 to 300 mg/m2 divided into 6 cohorts.
      Each patient will be assigned to a single cohort with no intrapatient dose escalation.
      Patients will received gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15 followed by LY2603618 on days 2, 9,
      and 16 of each 28 day cycle. The phase 1 portion will enroll approximately 26 patients total
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose to be carried into the phase 2 portion of the study.
