    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine, through the endpoints established in this protocol,
      the long-term safety and effectiveness of the Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System, in a
      post-approval environment.

    <textblock>
      The Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System is a next-generation modular system for endovascular
      repair of AAA. The system was designed with the following enhancements: a suprarenal wire
      frame to provide migration resistance, and improved flexibility designed to treat difficult
      anatomies.

      Medtronic Vascular submitted a Pre-Market Application (PMA) to the FDA on October 17, 2007,
      and received market approval for the Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System on April 15th,
      2008. As a condition of approval, the FDA has requested a post-approval study. Medtronic has
      therefore designed a post-approval study, in collaboration with FDA, to document the
      performance of the Talent Abdominal Stent Graft System under market conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, with or without iliac involvement.

          -  Iliac/femoral access vessel morphology that is compatible with vascular access
             techniques, devices, and/or accessories;

          -  A proximal aortic neck length of ≥ 10mm;

          -  Proximal aortic neck angulation ≤ 60°;

          -  Distal iliac artery fixation length of ≥ 15mm;

          -  An aortic neck diameter of 18-32mm and iliac artery diameters of 8-22mm; and

          -  Vessel morphology suitable for endovascular repair.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are less than 18 years of age

          -  Are pregnant or lactating

          -  Have a dominant patent inferior mesenteric artery and an occluded or stenotic celiac
             and/or superior mesenteric artery

          -  Have aneurysmal involvement or occlusion (surgically performed or naturally
             occurring) of the bilateral internal iliac arteries

          -  Have vessels and/or aneurysm dimensions that cannot accommodate the Talent Abdominal
             Stent Graft as per the indications in Section 3.

          -  Have no distal vascular bed (one vessel lower extremity run-off required)

          -  Have contraindications for use of contrast medium or anticoagulation drugs

          -  Have an uncorrectable coagulopathy

          -  Have an SVS/AAVS score greater than 2

          -  Have a mycotic aneurysm

          -  Have circumferential mural thrombus in the proximal aortic neck

          -  Have had a recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral vascular
             accident (CVA), or major surgical intervention

          -  Have traumatic aortic injury

          -  Have leaking, pending rupture or ruptured aneurysms

          -  Have pseudoaneurysms resulting from previous graft placement

          -  Require a revision to previously placed endovascular stent grafts.

          -  Have genetic connective tissue disease (e.g., Marfan's or Ehlers-Danlos' Syndromes)

          -  Have concomitant thoracic aortic or thoracoabdominal aneurysms

          -  Are patients with active systemic infections

          -  Are patients who have a condition that threatens to infect the graft.

          -  Are patients with sensitivities or allergies to the device materials.

          -  Have access vessels (as determined by treating physician) that preclude safe
             insertion of the delivery system. NOTE: Iliac conduits may be used to ensure the safe
             insertion of the delivery system.
