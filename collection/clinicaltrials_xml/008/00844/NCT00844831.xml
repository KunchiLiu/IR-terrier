  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with constipation often have bloating and abdominal distension. It is unclear if
      this is related to intestinal bacteria. Hypothesis: treatment for constipation may reduce
      small bowel and colon bacteria colonization, a change in the balance of stool
      microorganisms, and improve the symptoms of dyspepsia and constipation.

      This is an open-label study to collect data on upper and lower GI symptoms, hydrogen breath
      test, stool PCR, and serum before and after 4 weeks of lubiprostone 24 mcg by mouth twice a
      day for 4 weeks.
