      This study will combine two therapies to treat patients with unresectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma; sorafenib, and drug eluting beads delivered intra-arterially. The purpose of the
      study is to establish the safety and the effectiveness of the combination therapy. The
      investigators hypothesize that the combination of the two therapies will not result in
      greater toxicities to patients than that expected for either therapy given alone.

             significance, such as lung lesions less than 10 mm in diameter or enlarged periportal
             lymph nodes will not exclude patients, however, findings highly suspicious for
             metastatic HCC will exclude patients from this study.
