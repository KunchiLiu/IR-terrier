    <textblock>
      Introduction OHSS still remains a complication of assisted reproduction treatments. hCG
      administration to trigger final oocyte maturation will release vascular mediators, being
      VEGF and other proteins such as VE-Cadherin or Angiopoietin- 2. It has been shown that
      replacing hCG by GnRH agonists will induce a very short endogenous LH peak, potent enough to
      induce final oocyte maturation but no OHSS will develop. The investigators examined VEGF,
      VE-Cadherin and Angiopoietin-2 modulation by hCG as well as GnRH agonists in oocyte donors
      undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation.

      Material and Methods Between June and December of 2008 we evaluated 90 egg donors. They
      underwent COH with 150 IU rFSH as starting dose, we separated them in 3 groups (n:30 each):
      Groups 1 and 2 received a 0.25mg daily dose of GnRH antagonist when a follicle 14mm in
      diameter was observed. hCG 250g was given to group 1 while group 2 received triptorelin
      0.2mg when leading two follicles were 17mm. Group 3 was stimulated with standard long
      protocol, hCG was given following similar criteria.

      Blood was collected the day of hCG/aGnRH administration as well as the day of egg retrieval,
      and follicular fluid from the first two mature follicles was also frozen. We collected
      granulosa cells (GC) of 10 patients of each group as well Levels of VEGF, sVE-Cadherin an
      Angiopietin 2 were determined by ELISA in serum and in follicular fluid.

      Results were analyzed via ANOVA.Data are expressed as meanÂ± SEM. A significant difference
      was defined as p&lt; 0.05.
