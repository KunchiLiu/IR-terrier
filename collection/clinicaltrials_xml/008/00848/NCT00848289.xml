  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer (BC) is a model disease system for evaluating the relationship of tobacco,
      dietary, and occupational exposures (which are responsible for up to 90% of BCs) and
      host-specific susceptibility factors. The induction of BC by arylamines (from tobacco or
      occupational exposure) is one of the best understood types of carcinogenesis. There is also
      substantial evidence suggesting that an individual's genetic make-up influences
      susceptibility to cancer.

      This clinical research study will identify biologic and lifestyle factors which increase a
      person's risk of developing specific cancer. We propose to conduct a case-control study
      examining interindividual differences in susceptibility to tobacco carcinogenesis as
      predictors of bladder cancer risk. We will measure susceptibility to tobacco carcinogenesis
      and this will include studies of the genetic modulation of carcinogen activation and
      detoxification and of chromosome sensitivity to tobacco mutagens.
