      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of treadmill training on inflammation in
      the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, insulin action in the skeletal muscle, and whole
      body glucose metabolism in stroke survivors. The fundamental hypothesis of this study is
      that key inflammatory markers in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle are abnormal, skeletal
      muscle insulin signaling is impaired, and systemic insulin sensitivity is reduced in
      hemiparetic stroke patients and that these factors are modifiable and improved by exercise
      training in stroke patients.

      Many stroke survivors are sedentary and are at risk for the development of diabetes. We will
      study the interactions of adipose tissue and the paretic and non-paretic muscle
      inflammation, insulin signaling and action in hemiparetic stroke patients and the ability to
      employ exercise training to reverse these abnormalities in this ethnically diverse
      population. Participants aged 40-75 years with chronic stroke will be randomized to
      treadmill training versus stretch control group using a one-two-one blocked randomization on
      race (black vs. white), sex (male vs. female), and glucose tolerance status (normal vs.
      impaired and type 2 diabetes).

      Stroke occurs in over 780,000 persons each year in the U.S., the vast majority reported in
      persons older than 55 years of age. Following stroke, patients remain at continued high risk
      for recurrent stroke. Inflammatory processes lead to cardiovascular events/stroke and
      contribute to disease risk progression by impacting insulin resistance and the development
      of type 2 diabetes. Interventions that reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity
      have important clinical implications, especially in the stroke population.

      Task-oriented treadmill training is utilized to improve cardiovascular fitness and
      functional mobility in hemiparetic stroke patients. Additionally, preliminary data indicates
      that progressive treadmill training in this population improves glucose tolerance.
