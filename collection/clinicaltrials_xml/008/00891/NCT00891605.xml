        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subject must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          2. Subject must have a histologically and/or cytologically documented cancer for which
             paclitaxel has been determined an appropriate therapy, per the Investigator.

          3. Subjects with brain metastases must have clinically controlled neurologic symptoms,
             defined as surgical excision and/or radiation therapy followed by 21 days of stable
             neurologic function and no evidence of CNS disease progression as determined by CT or
             MRI within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          4. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of less than or equal
             to 1.

          5. Subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function per protocol
             defined local laboratory testing parameters.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. The subject has an underlying, predisposing condition of bleeding or currently
             exhibits signs of bleeding. The subject has a recent history of thrombocytopenia
             associated with bleeding within 1 year prior to first dose of study drug.

          2. Subject is currently receiving or requires anticoagulation therapy (e.g., warfarin at
             any dose) or any drugs or herbal supplements that affect platelet function, with the
             exception of low-dose anticoagulation medications such as heparin that are used to
             maintain the patency of a central intravenous catheter.

          3. The subject has active peptic ulcer disease or other potentially hemorrhagic
             esophagitis/gastritis.

          4. The subject has active immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic
             anemia (AIHA), or a history of being refractory to platelet transfusions (within 1
             year prior to the first dose of study drug).

          5. The subject has a significant history of cardiovascular (e.g., MI, thrombotic or
             thromboembolic event in the last 6 months), renal, neurologic, psychiatric,
             endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, or hepatic disease that in the opinion of the
             investigator would adversely affect his/her participating in this study.
