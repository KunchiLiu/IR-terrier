    <textblock>
      Impaired hand function is one of the most frequently persisting consequences of stroke. The
      purpose of this study is to compare two different treatments -- Contralataterally Controlled
      Functional Electrical Stimulation (CCFES) and Cyclic Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation
      (cNMES) -- for improved recovery of hand function after stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparesis of the upper limb is one of the most serious and most common impairments
      resulting from stroke. Approximately 75% of the over 750,000 strokes that occur annually in
      the United States cause some degree of upper extremity paralysis. Approximately 65% of
      stroke survivors still cannot use their affected hand to assist with activities of daily
      living 6 months after their stroke. The impact of upper extremity impairments on disability
      and health is great, yet there are relatively few rehabilitation interventions designed to
      restore function to the impaired upper limb. Therefore, our long-term objective is to
      develop upper extremity rehabilitation therapies that are effective at restoring arm and
      hand function, that are applicable across a wide range of impairment severity, and that are
      readily implemented in the present healthcare environment.

      The purpose of this study is to estimate the efficacy of Contralataterally Controlled
      Functional Electrical Stimulation (CCFES) in reducing upper extremity impairment and
      activity limitation in chronic upper extremity hemiplegia. CCFES is a rehabilitation
      intervention in which neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is applied to the finger
      and thumb extensor muscles of the paretic upper limb to open the hand. The stroke survivor
      controls the stimulation intensity, and consequent degree of hand opening, by modulating the
      degree of opening of the contralateral unimpaired hand, which is detected by an instrumented
      glove. Thus, volitional opening of the unaffected hand produces stimulated opening of the
      affected hand. The stimulation paradigm is used to assist the stroke survivor in practicing
      functional tasks with their affected hand. Pilot studies of CCFES in chronic hemiplegia were
      encouraging. This project will expand on the work already begun by: 1) determining if 12
      weeks of CCFES is therapeutically effective in chronic stroke survivors, 2) determining if a
      plateau in treatment effect is achieved before 12 weeks is completed, 3) determining how
      initial level of motor impairment affects treatment efficacy, and 4) determining whether
      therapeutic gains persist over time. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial in which
      102 chronic stroke survivors (&gt;6 months post-stroke) will be randomly assigned to receive 12
      weeks of CCFES or cyclic NMES, an intervention that provides electrical stimulation of the
      hand extensors, but with preprogrammed timing and intensity. Randomization will be
      stratified on two levels of baseline hand impairment defined by the degree of voluntary
      finger extension present. Assessments of upper extremity impairment and activity limitation
      will be made every 3 weeks during the treatment period and every 2 months during a 6-month
      follow-up period.

      This study is the first randomized controlled trial of CCFES in chronic upper extremity
      hemiplegia. Ultimately, the information learned in this study will serve to accelerate the
      development of treatments for reducing post-stroke disability.

    <description>CCFES - Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation
Electrical stimulator
Stimulation to finger and thumb extensors only in response to, and with an intensity proportional to, opening of the contralateral unimpaired hand.
A glove instrumented with sensors and worn on the unimpaired hand detects the degree of hand opening and determines stimulation intensity.
Therapy sessions are done with the subject being assisted by the CCFES system.</description>
