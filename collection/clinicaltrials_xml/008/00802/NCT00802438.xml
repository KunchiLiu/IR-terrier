    <textblock>
      A drug (mepolizumab) that reduces allergic inflammation will affect the function of allergy
      cells called eosinophils which are produced by the body in response to allergen exposure.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females age 18 to 50 yrs,

          -  History of asthma based upon presence of asthma symptoms such as cough, shortness of
             breath, wheeze or chest tightness,

          -  positive skin-prick test to a House Dust Mite extract,

          -  Forced expiratory volume at one second &gt;70% predicted pre-albuterol, &gt; 80% predicted
             post albuterol

          -  &gt;12% increase in Forced expiratory volume at one second following inhaled albuterol
             (180 Âµg) and/or

          -  airway responsiveness to methacholine (PC20 &lt;8mg/ml).

          -  &gt; 20% immediate drop in FEV1 following inhaled antigen challenge.

          -  Safety laboratory assessments within normal ranges (labs to include complete blood
             count with differential, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase,
             alanine aminotransferase, Prothrombin time, Partial Thromboplastin Time, and platelet
             count)

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             (urine HCG) within 48 hours of the methacholine challenge at Visit 2 and agree to use
             a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study (reliable methods of
             birth control can include abstinence, barrier methods, oral contraceptives, injection
             contraceptives or skin absorption contraceptives).

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, capable and willing to grant written informed
             consent and cooperate with study procedures and requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids or leukotriene inhibitors within 1 month
             of screening.

          -  Treatment with Omalizumab (anti-IgE) within 9 months of screening visit

          -  Concomitant use of any other monoclonal antibody

          -  Respiratory infection within 4 weeks of study

          -  Unstable asthma as indicated by self-report of increased symptoms or increased
             beta-agonist use over the previous 2 weeks.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, nursing or have a pregnancy planned during the
             course of study

          -  Current smokers (defined as smoked within the last year) or a former smoker with a
             history of &gt;5 pack years.

          -  Major health problems such as heart disease, type I and II diabetes or lung diseases
             other than asthma. Decisions regarding this criteria will be based upon the judgment
             of the investigator.

          -  Previous malignancy.

          -  Medication other than for asthma, allergies or contraception and that the
             investigator feels may interfere with the conduct of study (e.g. monoamine oxidase
             inhibitors and B-adrenergic antagonists in any form)

          -  Known history of allergic reaction to previous antibody administration.

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody,

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days of entering the study,

          -  History of noncompliance with medical regimens or subjects who are considered
             unreliable.
