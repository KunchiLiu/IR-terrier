  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of twice-daily oral dosing of
      6R-BH4 to improve endothelial function, reduce systolic blood pressure and reduce arterial
      stiffness.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By comparing values measured at different timepoints, the study is expected to provide
      insight regarding the ability of 6R-BH4, administered along with their currently prescribed
      antihypertension medications, to improve endothelial function, reduce SBP, and reduce
      arterial stiffness in patients with ISH and endothelial dysfunction
