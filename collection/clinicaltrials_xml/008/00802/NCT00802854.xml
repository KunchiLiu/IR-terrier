      The objective of this study is to determine any problems or questions associated with Eraxis
      after marketing, with regard to the following clauses under conditions of general clinical
      practice, in compliance with the regulation &quot;Re-examination guideline of new drugs&quot;.

        1. Serious adverse event/adverse drug reaction

        2. Unexpected adverse event/adverse drug reaction that have not been reflected in the
           approved drug label.

        3. Known adverse drug reaction

        4. Non-serious adverse drug reaction

        5. Other safety and effectiveness information

      Eraxis was first approved as new medicine on 30 May 2008. As required for any new medication
      approved by Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS), safety and effectiveness information of
      new medication should have been provided certain number of subjects administered in the
      setting of routine practice during the initial 6 years after the approval (until 29 May
      2014). However, all required subject had not enrolled during the original reexamination
      period (30 May 2008 ~ 29 May 2014). Therefore, according to an order from MFDS in 02 Mar
      2015, Eraxis PMS was required to collect rest of all required subjects by 02 September 2016
      in prospective and restrospective approach.
