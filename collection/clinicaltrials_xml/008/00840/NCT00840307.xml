  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how ectopic fat (in the pancreas, heart, liver and skeletal muscle),
      visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat changes following surgically induced weight loss using
      gastric banding. The investigators also evaluate whether changes in pancreatic fat content
      correlate with improvement in beta-cell function.

      We are looking for volunteers for this study,wich involves 7 visits over a period of 13
      months, the first visit taking place about 2 weeks prior to the planned surgery.

      Visit 1 - baseline, before starting your pre-operative diet Visit 2 - just before the
      surgery Visit 3 - around the time your first band inflation occurs Visit 4 - 1 month after
      the band inflation Visit 5 - 3 months after the first band inflation Visit 6 - 6 months
      after the first band inflation Visit 7 - 12 months after the first band inflation

      At each visit we do the following tests:

        1. MRI to measure your fat in the liver, pancreas, heart, muscle (leg), subcutaneous fat
           and visceral fat.

        2. Frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test - it is a 3.5 hrs test which
           determines the amount of insulin your body produces and how well your own insulin is
           being used by the body

        3. Body measurements (waist, hip circumference), cholesterol panel, liver function tests,
           HbA1c (to monitor diabetes control), blood pressure, weight.

      We also do an oral glucose tolerance test to check for diabetes on 3 occasions: visit 1,
      visit 5 and at the end, visit 7.

        Patients already scheduled to undergo gastric banding within 1-2 months.

        This study does NOT pay for the bariatric surgery, eligible participants must already be
        scheduled to have the surgery performed by their own physician
