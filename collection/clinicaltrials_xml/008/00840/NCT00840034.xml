    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to study the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LY2216684 as an
      adjunctive treatment for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who were identified
      as partial responders to an adequate course of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitor (SSRI) (as defined by history).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12 week multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the efficacy of
      LY2216684 augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with
      MDD who have a partial response to treatment with an SSRI. While remaining on a steady dose
      of their SSRI treatment at entry into the study, patients will be randomly assigned to
      adjunctive treatment with LY2216684 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio for 10 weeks of acute
      treatment.
