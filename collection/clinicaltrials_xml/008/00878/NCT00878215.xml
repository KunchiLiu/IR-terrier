    <textblock>
      Image-guided surgery is a new technology, which is used to create 3-D pictures that generate
      a map of the liver. This map will allow surgeons to know the exact anatomical location of
      their instruments, including instances when direct visualization is not possible. This study
      is designed to determine the safety and feasibility of using image-guided techniques for
      treatment of liver tumors. The overall goal of this study is to use image-guided surgery for
      the improvement of the surgeon's ability to remove liver tumors.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Phase 1</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The objective of phase 1 is to localize anatomical points on the liver surface using image-guided surgery and laser range scanning. The specific endpoint of this phase will be reached when we perform 10 successful intraoperative registrations with no more than a 30% failure rate over all the cases.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Phase 2</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The objective of phase 2 is to determine the accuracy with which image guided surgery (IGS) can be used to implant a ceramic bead inside a tumor. After the ceramic bead is implanted using IGS, the tumor will be removed with standard surgical resection methods and analyzed using imaging. The specific endpoint of this phase is to achieve delivery of the bead to within 8mm of the pre-operatively planned target point. If we are unable to insert the ceramic bead due to technical or anatomical difficulty, we will consider this a screen failure.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>phase 3</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The objective of phase 3 is to ascertain the target accuracy of an ablation probe using image-guided surgery technology. After the ablation procedure, tumors will be removed with standard resection procedures and analyzed using pathology. The specific endpoint of this phase is to achieve an ablation burn within a 5 mm radius of the tumor centroid. A measurement of the ablation probe placement via the burn zone will be performed by pathology via specimen sectioning.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Phase 4</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The objective of Phase 4 is to perform ablation using image-guided surgery on tumors within patients who are not candidates for standard surgical resection. The specific endpoint is to reach a 90% success rate of complete ablation according to early post-ablative imaging studies as well as no recurrence of the tumor within 6 months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained.

          -  Patient must be 18 years or older.

          -  Are male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females. Liver resection or ablation could be
             harmful to an unborn child therefore, is not recommended during pregnancy. After
             informed consent is obtained, women of childbearing potential will be required to
             have a blood or urine pregnancy test. All consented patients of childbearing
             potential will be advised to use adequate birth control (oral, implanted, or barrier
             methods) along with their sexual partners while being considered for liver tumor
             resection or ablation and at least up to a month following surgery.

          -  Patients enrolled in Phase I must be candidates for surgical liver resection per a
             treating surgeon's discretion. Patients enrolled in Phase 2-3 must be candidates for
             surgical liver resection of liver mass. Patients enrolled in Phase 4 must be
             candidates for surgical ablation, but not candidates for surgical resection.

          -  Patients are scheduled clinically for use of the Pathfinder Explorer Liver Image
             Guided System which is indicated for open liver surgical procedures where
             image-guidance may be appropriate and where the patient can tolerate long apneic
             periods under general anesthesia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, might increase the risk to
             the subject or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the
             objectives of the study.

          -  Mental condition rendering the subject or his/her legal representative unable to
             understand informed consent to the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the
             study.
