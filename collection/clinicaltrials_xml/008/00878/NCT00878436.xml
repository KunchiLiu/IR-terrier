    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to investigate the safety, dosing schedule, and efficacy of the
      combination treatment of Panobinostat (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) and hormone therapy
      for recurrent prostate cancer. This trial is at its Phase II stage. As of July 23, 2013 Arm
      B was closed to accrual, all the remaining slots in accrual will be allocated to Arm A.

    <textblock>
      The preclinical data indicate that Panobinostat restores the sensitivity of
      androgen-independent cells to bicalutamide (Casodex®) and the combination has synergistic
      inhibitory activity. Here, we hypothesize that treatment of castration-resistant patients
      with Panobinostat will enhance the response to the second line hormone therapy with
      bicalutamide (Casodex®). In the proposed phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose of
      tri-weekly, intermittent oral Panobinostat at three different dose levels (60, 90, 120
      mg/week) in combination with Casodex (50mg PO) will be determined; The following phase II
      study will evaluated the efficacies of 9-month treatments of the selected
      Panobinostat-Casodex combination and also a lower dose of Panobinostat. We expect that
      Casodex-Panobinostat combination treatment of castration-resistant patients will prevent
      biochemical and/or metastatic disease progression of these patients compared to historical
      controls in the same time period.
