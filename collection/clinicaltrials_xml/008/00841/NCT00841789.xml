      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Etanercept (Enbrel) when used in
      conjunction with IVIG and aspirin, improves treatment response to IVIG in patients with
      Kawasaki Disease. Funding Source- FDA/OOPD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a potentially life threatening acute vasculitis in children with a
      predilection for involvement of the coronary arteries. Aspirin and Intravenous gamma
      globulin (IVIG) are principally used for the treatment of the symptoms of Kawasaki Disease.
      Aspirin reduces inflammation and platelet formation, but has no effect in attenuating the
      development of coronary abnormalities. Although IVIG reduces inflammation and the prevalence
      of coronary artery abnormalities, it has a relatively high failure rate of 23-30%,
      warranting new treatment methods for Kawasaki Disease. We propose a placebo controlled
      double blinded randomized study to determine if etanercept 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously (max 25
      mg) given three times at weekly intervals starting at initial diagnosis is safe in this
      patient population and if it is a successful adjunct therapy with IVIG in reducing the
      incidence of persistent or recurrent fever.
