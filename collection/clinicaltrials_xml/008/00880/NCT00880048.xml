      This is a 6-week, randomised, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled, fixed dose
      parallel group study to assess the efficacy and safety of orvepitant (30 and 60 mg/day)
      versus placebo in subjects with a diagnosis of a Major Depressive Disorder, whose symptoms
      are considered moderate or severe.

      Following an initial screening visit, subjects fulfilling the study inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will enter a pre-treatment screening phase to permit evaluation of the laboratory
      and ECG assessments and to confirm eligibility for inclusion into the study. This screening
      phase will be a minimum of 7 days, but no longer than 21 days. At the completion of the
      screening period, eligible subjects will be randomised at the baseline visit to receive
      either orvepitant 30mg/day, orvepitant 60mg/day or placebo (equal chance of receiving any of
      the three possible treatments, i.e., a 1:1:1 ratio) for a six-week double-blind treatment
      phase. Those subjects randomised to receive placebo will receive study medication identical
      in appearance to that received by subjects assigned to receive orvepitant 30 or 60mg/day.

      Efficacy will be assessed via standard depression symptom and severity rating scales or
      questionaires. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) will be used as the primary
      measure. Secondary efficacy endpoints include the Quick Inventory of Depressive
      Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) and the Clinical Global Impression- Global Improvement and Severity
      of Illness Scale (CGI-I and CGI-S, respectively).

      Safety will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events (side effects) and through periodic
      laboratory evaluations (blood tests), vital signs assessments (e.g., blood pressure, heart
      rate, temperature) and heart function measurements (electrocardiograms, or ECGs).

      The purpose of the current study is to test the safety and the anti-depressant effects of
      orvepitant, an investigational antidepressant. Efficacy will be assessed using standard
      depression symptom and severity rating scales (questionaires). The Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale (HAM-D) will serve as the primary measure of efficacy, and . Secondary efficacy
      endpoints include the Bech Melancholia Scale (sum of items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, and 13 of the
      17-item HAM-D scale), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR), the
      Clinical Global Impression- Global Improvement and Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-I and
      CGI-S, respectively), the HAM-D anxiety factor score (sum of items 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and
      17), the Cognitive and Physical Function Questionnaire (CPFQ) and a morning sleep
      questionnaire.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs or side effects),
      physical examinations (including vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate),
      clinical laboratory assessments (blood tests), electrical recordings of the heart
      (electrocardiograms or ECG's), the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS),
      Sexual Function Questionnaire (SFQ), and weight change.

      Blood samples will be taken at different time points to assess blood levels of orvepitant in
      patients, allowing the relationship between amount of orvepitant in the body and efficacy to
      be studied.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the antidepressant efficacy of orvepitant
      (30 and 60mg/day) versus placebo (a &quot;sugar pill&quot;, with no active ingredients). The secondary
      objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability of orvepitant, assessing the
      profile of appearance and disappearance of orvepitant in the body (blood) following
      administration (i.e., assessing how long the drug remains in the body), and lastly to
      examine the relationship between blood levels of the drug and efficacy (i..e, the change in
      HAM-D total score relative to what it was before starting the study medication.

      Following an initial screening visit, subjects fulfilling the study entrance criteria will
      enter a pre-treatment screening phase to permit evaluation of the laboratory and
      electrocardiogram assessments and to confirm eligibility for inclusion into the study. This
      screening phase will be a minimum of 7 days, but no longer than 21 days. During the
      screening period and the treatment phase if the study, if the subject is selected for study
      entry, subjects will undergo assessments of their depressive symptoms via a face-to-face
      interview as well as via a video-based system (i.e., live subject interview conducted by an
      off-site interviewer using a web-based video camera). Upon completion of the screening
      period, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned at the baseline visit to one of three
      treatment regimens: orvepitant 30mg/day, orvepitant 60mg/day or placebo for a six-week
      treatment phase. The chances of receiving each of the three possible treatments will be
      equal. Orvepitant will be administered as tablets. Those subjects randomised to receive
      placebo will receive study medication identical in appearance to that received by subjects
      assigned to receive orvepitant.

      During the treatment phase, subjects will be required to return to the clinic at the end of
      Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6. In addition, all subjects will be required to return for a follow-up
      visit 14 days after the last dose of study medication. In addition, all subjects with
      ongoing adverse events at the 14-day follow-up visit will be required to return for a
      further follow-up visit 28 days after the last dose of study medication.

      Male and female outpatients between the ages of 18 to 64 years inclusive with a primary
      diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder will be enrolled into this study. A total of
      approximately 350 subjects are expected to be enrolled at approximately 30 different study
      sites in the U.S. and Canada.
