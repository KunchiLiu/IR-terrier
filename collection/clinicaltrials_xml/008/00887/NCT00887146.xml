  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving
      radiation with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide versus radiation with adjuvant PCV is
      more effective in treating anaplastic glioma or low grade glioma.

      This study will be a randomized phase III for patients with newly diagnosed co-deleted
      1p/19q anaplastic glioma or high risk low grade glioma. The trial will only enroll patients
      with 1p/19q co-deletion. This study includes two arms as described in the &quot;Arms&quot; section. A
      dynamic allocation procedure will be used to allocate an equal number of patients to
      different arms (Arms A:B = 1:1). This procedure will balance the marginal distributions of
      the stratification factors among arms. The stratification factors that will be used are
      cooperative groups (EORTC vs. all North American groups), age (≤ 50 vs. &gt; 50), performance
      score (ECOG 0-1 vs. 2), and tumor grade (anaplastic glioma vs. low grade glioma).

      The primary goal is to determine whether patients who receive radiotherapy with concomitant
      temozolomide (TMZ) followed by adjuvant temozolomide (RT + TMZ --&gt; TMZ) (Arm B) have a
      marginally better progression free survival (PFS) as compared with patients who receive
      radiotherapy followed by PCV chemotherapy (RT --&gt; PCV)(Arm A).

      Secondary Goals:

        1. Time to Progression - To determine whether patients who receive (RT + TMZ --&gt; TMZ) have
           a significantly longer time to progression (clinical or radiographic progression) as
           compared with patients who receive radiotherapy followed by adjuvant PCV chemotherapy
           (RT --&gt; PCV).

        2. Correlation between exploratory biomarkers and survival - To determine whether there is
           a difference in survival based on t(1;19)(q10, p10) translocation status and MGMT
           promoter hypermethylation status.

        3. Descriptive Comparisons of Additional Secondary Endpoints - To perform descriptive
           comparisons of additional secondary outcome endpoints, including overall survival,
           objective tumor response, prognostic factor analysis and quality of life.

        4. Toxicity - To determine the toxicity of the treatment in each arm and perform
           descriptive comparisons.

        5. Neurocognitive and Quality of Life (QOL) Effects - To determine the neurocognitive and
           QOL effects in patients treated on this protocol and correlate these results with
           outcome endpoints.

        6. Banking of Biospecimens and Neuroimaging Studies - To store blood products (i.e.,
           plasma, DNA and buffy coat), tumor tissue and MRI/CT images for future scientific
           investigations.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year, then
      every 4 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until progressive disease or until the
      end of study participation.

             that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects: Pregnant women, nursing
             women, men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          7. Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment
             for the primary neoplasm.

          8. Other active malignancy within 5 years of registration. Exceptions:

             Non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Note: If there is a
             history of prior malignancy, the patient must not be receiving other specific
             treatment (other than hormonal therapy) for their cancer.

          9. History of myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months, or congestive heart failure requiring
             use of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

         10. Recent history of hepatitis infection or treating physician determined that the
             patient would be at significant risk of reactivation of hepatitis.
