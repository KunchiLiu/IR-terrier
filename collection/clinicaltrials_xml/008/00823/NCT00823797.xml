    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well bendamustine hydrochloride works in treating patients
      with anaplastic glioma or glioblastoma that has come back (recurrent) or growing, spreading
      or getting worse (progressive). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary endpoint for this study is the 6-month progression-free survival-i.e., the
      proportion of patients who remain alive and free of any tumor progression at 6 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of single agent bendamustine (Treanda) (bendamustine
      hydrochloride) the treatment of malignant gliomas.

      II. To determine the efficacy of bendamustine (Treanda) as a single agent as assessed by
      progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.

      III. To assess quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain
      (FACT-BR).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days
      1-2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 2
      months for up to 3 years.

          -  If a patient has had surgery prior to enrolling on study, an enhanced MRI or CT scan
             should be done within 96 hours prior to surgery or at least 4-6 weeks after surgery

          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:

               -  At least 12 weeks between completion of SRS and initiation of bendamustine

          -  Interstitial brachytherapy: patients must have confirmation of true progressive
             disease rather than radiation necrosis based upon either PET or Thallium SPECT, MR
             spectroscopy and MR perfusion or surgical documentation of disease

          -  Patients must have had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen that included
             temozolomide and no more than one prior salvage chemotherapy

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 4 weeks from
             prior cytotoxic therapy and/or at least 2 weeks from vincristine, 6 weeks from
             nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration, and 1 week for non-cytotoxic
             agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc.
