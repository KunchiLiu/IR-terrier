      This study will determine the effectiveness of antidepressant medication in preventing
      depression and improving recovery in people who have been supported by mechanical
      ventilators in an intensive care unit (ICU).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than one third of all people admitted to ICUs in hospitals require mechanical
      ventilation for respiratory failure. Many people who survive after being on mechanical
      ventilation for a prolonged time have significant issues with recovery and quality of life
      when discharged from the ICU. They are also more prone to depression, which increases
      patient suffering and the need for medical care, decreases quality of life, and is
      associated with increased mortality. Previous research indicates that antidepressant
      medications may improve quality of life and recovery in people who have had a heart attack,
      but that behavioral treatments are not effective in this case. Treating depression in ICU
      patients with respiratory failure has not been examined. In this study, antidepressant
      medications will be given to people who have been on mechanical ventilation in an ICU to
      determine the effectiveness of antidepressants in improving medical recovery and quality of
      life. Only a small number of participants will be enrolled in this trial to test the methods
      and theory; if it is successful, a larger trial will be conducted to determine whether these
      findings can be widely generalized.

      Participation in this study will last 8 weeks, with follow-up assessments lasting for 6
      months. Participants on a ventilation machine will be randomly assigned to receive either
      escitalopram, which is an FDA-approved antidepressant, or a placebo pill. A healthy
      surrogate may need to enroll participants in the study, because participants will begin
      treatment while in the ICU and may not be able to make an informed decision. The medication
      or placebo treatment will last for 2 months, continuing at the participant's home after
      discharge from the ICU. Dosage levels will begin at 10 mg per day and will be increased to
      20 mg per day for some participants after 3 to 5 weeks. Every 2 weeks, participants will
      complete questionnaires by phone or in person about their medical and psychological symptoms
      and about whether they are taking the study medication. At 8 weeks, participants will
      complete an in-person interview about depression symptoms, quality of life, and physical
      function. At 9 weeks, participants will complete a telephone interview about medication
      withdrawal. Finally, at 4 and 6 months, participants will complete interviews about
      depression and general health.
