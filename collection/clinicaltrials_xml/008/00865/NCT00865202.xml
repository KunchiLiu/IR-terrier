    <textblock>
      Post-operative delirium is a common and deleterious complication in elderly patients. The
      investigators have previously found lower levels of serum tryptophan in post-operative
      elderly patients who developed delirium in comparison to post-operative elderly patients who
      did not develop delirium. The investigators hypothesize that post-operative supplementation
      of L-tryptophan will reduce the duration and incidence of post-operative delirium. This
      study is a double-blinded placebo controlled trial of L-tryptophan supplementation in
      post-operative ICU patients 60 years and older. The primary outcome measure is the
      comparison of duration of post-operative delirium in subjects who receive L-tryptophan
      supplementation versus a similar appearing control.

    <description>The incidence and/or duration of excitatory (hyperactive and mixed) post-operative delirium, diagnosed by the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU) with the Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS), will be reduced with enteral L-tryptophan supplementation (1 gm TID for the first 3 post-op days), compared to placebo, in older patients (≥ 60 years) undergoing operations requiring ICU admission.
The incidence and/or duration of all types of post-operative delirium, diagnosed by the CAM-ICU with the RASS, will be reduced with enteral L-tryptophan supplementation (1 gm TID for the first 3 post-op days), compared to placebo, in older patients (≥ 60 years) undergoing operations requiring ICU admission.</description>
