      The aims of the study are to test for treatment outcome differences in alcohol dependent
      subjects randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with NTX (50mg/day) or placebo among
      those with one or two copies of the Asp40 allele of the mu-opioid receptor compared to those
      homozygous for the Asn40 allele. Thus, the design of the study is a 2X2 cell double-blind
      randomization to NTX or placebo stratified by genotype. To meet these aims, 150 alcohol
      dependent outpatients with one or two copies of the Asp40 variant of the mu-opioid receptor
      and 190 subjects homozygous for the Asn40 variant will be recruited across the four
      participating sites.

      Despite the well established efficacy of naltrexone, there are significant variations in
      individual responses to naltrexone. A critical question remains: under what circumstances
      and for which patients will naltrexone (NTX) be most beneficial? Recent work at our center
      provides evidence that the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene polymorphism A118G (Asn40Asp)
      imparts a significant change in treatment response. We have shown that patients with 1-2
      copies of the Asp40 variant have significantly better treatment responses than patients with
      Asn40 variant (absence of heavy drinking -73.9% v/s 49% response). To further consolidate
      our knowledge, we wish to test the relationship between A118G polymorphism and the response
      to treatment with naltrexone. This work is focused on subjects of European or Asian descent
      as the A118G polymorphism occurs in less than 1% of those of African descent.

      The study consists of 12 weeks of outpatient treatment with 50mg/day of naltrexone or
      placebo. Up to 340 subjects will be recruited across four sites. The inclusion criteria
      include adult males and females of European or Asian descent with DSM-IV diagnosis of
      alcohol dependence and heavy drinking per TLFB criteria. Patients with major psychiatric
      disorders or on psychotropic medications, other substance dependence problems (except
      nicotine), severe cognitive impairment, active suicidal/homicidal thoughts and serious
      medical conditions (including liver disorders) will be excluded.

      The ultimate aim of this line of investigation is to further establish a genetic link
      between alcohol dependence and treatment by defining an endophenotype associated with
      treatment response.

      Based upon these very promising findings, the aim of this study is to examine prospectively
      the interaction between a functional polymorphism of the mu-opioid receptor (A+118G
      (Asn40Asp)) and response to treatment with naltrexone. A secondary aim of this study is to
      examine the role of the Asp40 allele in alternating the subjective effects from alcohol use
      in alcohol dependent individuals that have been demonstrated in human laboratory
      experiments.

      We hypothesize that naltrexone - but not placebo - will produce a greater clinical response
      during the 12 weeks of the trial in subjects with one or two copies of the Asp40 variant
      (&quot;Asp40 positives&quot;) than in subjects homozygous for the Asn40 allele. Response to naltrexone
      will be measured by a reduction in the number of heavy drinking days (as defined by &gt;5
      drinks/day for males; &gt;4 for females) during the 12 weeks of the trial.

      We also expect that there will be an interaction between medication and genotype such that,
      as compared to the groups on placebo or homozygous for Asn40, Asp40 positive subjects
      randomized to naltrexone will report less &quot;high&quot; from alcohol consumption (on the Biphasic
      Alcohol Effects Scale), and the lowest levels of alcohol craving over time (on the Penn
      Alcohol Craving Scale).
