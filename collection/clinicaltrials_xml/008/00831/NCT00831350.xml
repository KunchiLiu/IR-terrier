    <textblock>
      This is a study of subjects with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) specifically looking at the
      difference in outcomes between patients with posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and those
      without PVD. Posterior vitreous detachment is a condition where the gel-like substance that
      occupies the space between the retina and the lens of the eye liquefies and separates from
      the retina. 20 subjects from Barnes Retina Institute will be enrolled in this study. Based
      on a pre-treatment ultrasound (a test utilizing high-frequency sound waves to look at the
      inside of the eye), high resolution OCT (a noninvasive procedure called optical coherence
      tomography to check the thickness of your retina) and clinical exam, subjects will be
      assigned to one of 2 groups at baseline: Group 1 will be those with PVD and Group 2 will be
      those without PVD. Then subjects will receive monthly intravitreal (inside the eye)
      injections of Ranibizumab.

    <textblock>
      Several retinovascular diseases have been shown to be VEGF dependent including retinal vein
      occlusion, wet age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. The role of the
      vitreous or composition of the vitreous cavity has been examined in diabetic retinopathy on
      many occasions in the past and clinically it has been felt that a posterior vitreous
      separation leads a quieting and involution of diabetic retinopathy, both proliferative as
      well as pre-proliferative retinopathy. This clinical observation has never had any basic
      science data to support it. However, it has recently been shown that in cat eyes with
      posterior vitreous separation the vitreous cavity has a much lower VEGF concentration than
      in cat eyes with an attached posterior vitreous. This may be due to the fact that flow of
      oxygen from the retinal vasculature is increased by PVD. Vitreous oxygen levels are
      inversely associated with vitreous VEGF levels. As oxygen tension increases, VEGF levels
      will decline. This suggests if higher amounts of VEGF are present in the eye without PVD
      perhaps a powerful anti-VEGF drug, such as ranibizumab, may be of greater benefit to treat
      VEGF dependent retinovascular disease. To try and answer this question clinically, we have
      suggested that an analysis of the vitreous status in treatment naive eyes with retinal vein
      occlusion beginning ranibizumab therapy be undertaken to see if eyes without a posterior
      vitreous separation would achieve greater improvement in vision and a return to more normal
      retinal physiology compared to eyes with a posterior vitreous separation. No study has
      assessed PVDs in RVO patients receiving potential treatment.
