  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal for this study is to understand the physiological mechanisms of various
      forms of spinal manipulation in order to refine and improve this therapy for appropriately
      selected patients. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of high-velocity
      low-amplitude spinal manipulation and low-velocity variable amplitude spinal manipulation on
      three types of sensorimotor abilities in patients with low back pain.

      In collaboration with the University of Iowa, the Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research
      will pursue the following specific aims: 1) To determine the immediate pre-to-post changes
      from HVLA-SM and LVVA-SM to the lumbo-pelvic region, compared to a control group receiving
      light effleurage and a sham mechanically assisted adjustment, on sensorimotor function as
      measured by: lumbo-pelvic repositioning ability, standing postural sway, and response to
      sudden trunk loading; 2) To determine the effects of 2 weeks (4 applications @ 2 per week)
      of HVLA-SM and LVVA-SM to the lumbo-pelvic region, compared to a control group receiving
      light effleurage and a sham mechanically assisted adjustment, on sensorimotor function as
      measured by: lumbo-pelvic repositioning ability, standing postural sway and response to
      sudden trunk loading; 3) To determine the effects of 6 weeks (12 applications @ 2 per week)
      of HVLA-SM and LVVA-SM to the lumbo-pelvic region on sensorimotor function as measured by:
      Lumbo-pelvic repositioning ability, standing postural sway, and response to sudden truck
      loading; 4) To explore whether changes in sensorimotor function are associated with changes
      in self-reported back pain intensity, related disability, or health status at 2 weeks (after
      4 SM Visits) and at 6 weeks (after 12 SM Visits); 5) To determine if sensorimotor function
      changes are greater in patients a priori clinically classified as being most appropriate for
      manipulation.; 6)Describe the sensorimotor and clinical effects of 4 weeks of full spine and
      extremity (clinician's choice) care following 2 weeks of receiving light effleurage and a
      sham mechanically assisted adjustment for participants with low back pain; and 7) To explore
      if there is an association between: a. DC characterization of the quality of the SM (as
      rated on a survey) and the biomechanics of the SM (as measured by the force-time profile,
      biomechanical assessments, and videotape), and b. DC and participant characterization of
      quality of the SM (as rated on surveys).
