    <description>MLN8237 will be administered orally (PO) at a dose of 50 mg twice daily (BID) for seven consecutive days followed by a 14-day rest period, in 21-day cycles. Dose reductions will be implemented in the setting of drug-related toxicities.
The first dose of MLN8237 on Cycle 1, Day 1 will be administered in the study clinic. Patients will continue to receive repeated cycles of MLN8237 treatment for up to 12 months, or until there is evidence of disease progression or unacceptable treatment-related toxicity. Treatment with MLN8237 may be continued beyond 12 months if it is determined that a patient would clearly derive benefit from continued therapy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Male or female patients 18 years or older

          2. Eligible diagnoses:

               -  Acute myelogenous leukemia (except APL) with &gt; 10% bone marrow or peripheral
                  blood blasts; failed to achieve CR or relapse after prior therapy, not
                  candidates for potentially curative treatment. Untreated patients &gt; 60 are
                  eligible if not candidates for standard induction.

               -  High-grade MDS, defined by all the following features: IPSS Intermediate-2 or
                  High Risk; &gt; 10% blasts on bone marrow examination; treatment failure from, or
                  not candidates for, standard therapies including demethylating agents, eg
                  azacytidine or decitabine.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group perf. status 0-2

          4. Female patients:

               -  Postmenopausal for at least one year

               -  Surgically sterile, or

               -  If childbearing potential, agree to practice two effective methods of
                  contraception or abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          5. Male patients:

               -  Practice effective barrier contraception to one month after the last dose of
                  study drug, or

               -  Abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          6. Voluntary written consent

          7. Patients on hydroxyurea may be included

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating females

          2. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or AIDS-related illness

          3. Serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,
             potentially interfere with the protocol completion

          4. Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          5. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 2.5 × the ULN.
             AST, ALT may be elevated to 5 x the ULN if reasonably ascribed to underlying
             hematological disorder.

          6. Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/minute

          7. Antineoplastic or radiotherapy within 14 days preceding the first dose

          8. Myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment or current history of New York
             Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia

          9. Major surgery 14 days prior to the first dose

         10. Clinically uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

         11. Inability to swallow capsules

         12. History of uncontrolled sleep apnea or conditions that result in excessive daytime
             sleepiness, such as chronic lung disease
