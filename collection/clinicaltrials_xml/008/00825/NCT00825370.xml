      We are testing whether patients who received protocolized pain management (1 mg of IV
      hydromorphone followed by an additional 1 mg IV hydromorphone 15 minutes later if the
      patients wants more) will have better pain relief and no more adverse events than patients
      receiving discretionary care, in which the patients receives whatever IV opioid the treating
      physician wants to give, in whatever dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 21 to 64 years.

          2. Pain with onset within 7 days.

          3. ED attending physician's judgment that patient's pain warrants use of intravenous
             opioids.

          4. Normal mental status.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior use of methadone.

          2. Use of other opioids, tramadol, or heroin in the past seven days.

          3. Prior adverse reaction to morphine, hydromorphone, or other opioids.

          4. Chronic pain syndrome.

          5. Alcohol intoxication.

          6. Systolic BP &lt; 90 mm Hg.

          7. Use of MAO inhibitors in past 30 days.

          8. Weight less than 100 pounds.

          9. Baseline room air oxygen saturation less than 95%.

         10. C02 measurement greater than 46: In accordance with a number of similar studies that
             we have performed, four subsets of patients will have their CO2 measured using a
             handheld capnometer prior to enrollment in the study. If the CO2 measurement is
             greater than 46, then the patient will be excluded from the study. The 4 subsets are
             as follows:

               1. All patients who have a history of COPD

               2. All patients who have a history of sleep apnea

               3. All patients who report a history of asthma together with greater than a 20
                  pack-year smoking history

               4. All patients reporting less than a 20 pack-year smoking history who are having
                  an asthma exacerbation
