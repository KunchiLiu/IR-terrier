      This study will determine whether the drug metformin improves the effects of traditional
      antidepressant medications in people who are overweight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current depression treatments are not effective for approximately one-half of overweight
      people, and depression eventually returns in approximately one-third of those overweight
      people whose initial treatment is effective. One possible reason for these treatment
      failures is that overweight people often experience a condition called insulin resistance
      (IR), which can lead to type 2 diabetes, an associated disease that might also affect
      depression treatment. IR results in elevated blood sugar levels that may interfere with
      medications used to treat depression. Metformin, a medication commonly used to treat
      diabetes, reduces blood sugar levels. This study will examine whether taking metformin with
      the antidepressant medication sertraline will enhance the effectiveness of sertraline in
      people who are overweight and depressed.

      Participation in this study will be divided into two phases lasting a total of 40 weeks.
      Phase 1 will last 16 weeks and include baseline testing and seven scheduled study visits.
      During this phase, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either sertraline and
      metformin or sertraline and placebo on a daily basis. The baseline visit will include the
      following tests and measures: an electrocardiogram (EKG), which will measure the electrical
      activity in the heart; an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which will measure how a
      person's body breaks down glucose; a blood test, which will measure lipids, hemoglobin A1C,
      and other cardiometabolic risk factors; a dual energy x-ray absorptimetry (DEXA) scan, which
      will measure body fat; a pregnancy test for women; measurements of vital signs, height,
      weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist circumference; and questionnaires concerning health,
      medication use, physical activity, diet, and mood. Some of the questionnaires will be
      administered through interviews with a researcher. During the study visits, which will occur
      every 2 weeks, participants will complete questionnaires, unused medication will be
      collected, and new medication will be handed out. At Week 8, participants will provide an
      additional blood sample by finger stick. At the end of Phase 1, participants will undergo
      repeat baseline testing.

      Participants whose depression has improved after Phase 1 will be eligible to continue to
      Phase 2 of the study, which will determine the longer term effects of taking metformin with
      sertraline. Phase 2 of the study will last 24 weeks, with study visits occurring monthly.
      During the study visits, participants will complete questionnaires again, and medication
      will be collected and handed out. At Weeks 24 and 32, participants will provide blood
      samples by finger stick. After completing Phase 2, participants will again undergo repeat
      baseline testing.
