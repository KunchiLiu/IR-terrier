  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a procedure that people with coronary artery
      disease (CAD) may undergo to increase blood flow to the heart. During a CABG procedure,
      people who have a leak in one of the valves in the heart—the mitral valve—may at the same
      time undergo a procedure that repairs the valve. This study will evaluate whether people
      with moderate mitral valve leakage would be better off undergoing CABG plus the mitral valve
      repair procedure or undergoing CABG alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAD occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become blocked as a result of
      plaque buildup. In severe cases, CAD can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart
      attack. CABG is one treatment option for people with CAD. During a CABG procedure, a healthy
      artery or vein from another part of the body is connected to the blocked coronary artery.
      Blood flow is then routed around the blockage to the heart.

      After a heart attack, some people may have a leak in the mitral valve of the heart. This
      condition is known as ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) and is associated with poor health
      outcomes, including worsening heart failure. In people with severe mitral valve leakage, the
      CABG procedure and a mitral valve repair procedure are routinely performed together;
      however, in people with only moderate valve leakage, there is no consensus in the medical
      community as to whether the mitral valve repair procedure is beneficial at the time of CABG.
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether people with moderate mitral valve
      regurgitation should undergo a mitral valve repair procedure in addition to CABG or undergo
      CABG alone.

      This study will enroll people with CAD who require a CABG procedure and have moderate mitral
      regurgitation. At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo a physical examination;
      blood collection; neurocognitive tests; and questionnaires regarding medical history,
      medication history, and quality of life. In the operating room, participants will be
      randomly assigned to undergo either CABG surgery and the mitral valve repair procedure or
      only CABG surgery. Blood, urine, and tissue samples may be collected from participants after
      the surgery; this is optional and will only be done with prior approval from participants.
      All participants will attend study visits at Months 6, 12, and 24. At each visit,
      participants will take part in a medication history review, a physical examination, an
      echocardiogram, a cardiopulmonary exercise test, neurocognitive tests, and quality of life
      surveys.

    <description>Surgical techniques for mitral valve repair may need to be adjusted at the discretion of the surgeon, as based on intra-operative findings that may not be previously recognized in the pre-operative evaluation. The common elements for mitral annuloplasty planned as part of this study include the following:
All procedures will be performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and with moderate hypothermia. Cannulation will be central with aortic cannulation for arterial inflow from the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. Right atrial or bicaval (inferior and superior vena cava) drainage cannulas will be employed.
The heart will be arrested with cardioplegia.
A complete annular ring shall be placed unless specifically contraindicated by intra-operative findings. Additional repair of the mitral apparatus itself will be based on intra-operative findings.</description>

    <description>CABG will be performed using standard surgical techniques. Conduit selection and harvesting methods will not be prescribed, except that utilization of the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) is recommended when a left anterior descending (LAD) graft is indicated. The technical details of bypass grafting will not be prescribed. Complete revascularization will be performed, within the judgment of the surgical investigator.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate mitral regurgitation in the judgment of the clinical site echocardiographer,

             would be: ERO between 0.2 cmsq to 0.39 cmsq. If ERO &lt; 0.2, then the degree of mitral
             regurgitation will be guided by other color Doppler quantitative methods (jet
