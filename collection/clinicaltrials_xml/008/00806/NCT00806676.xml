  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with chronic kidney disease are known to have immune response abnormalities,
      including a diminished response to some vaccinations. Those with chronic kidney disease have
      a disproportionate burden of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- and/or 18-related genital tract disease. Due
      to immune response abnormalities, the CKD population may or may not respond to the
      recommended three-dose regimen of Gardasil®, a vaccine intended to protect against HPV 6-,
      11-, 16-, and 18-related genital tract disease. The objective of this study is to measure
      the antibody response to Gardasil® in female patients 9-21 years of age with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) (Stage 1-4), end-stage kidney disease (Stage 5 CKD), and status-post kidney
      transplant. Gardasil® vaccine will be administered according to the FDA-approved schedule.
      Blood samples to measure antibody levels to vaccine strains of human papillomavirus (HPV)
      will be obtained at months 0, 7 and 24.
