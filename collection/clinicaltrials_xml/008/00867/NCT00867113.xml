      This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center study conducted in the USA. The
      primary endpoint is to evaluate the use of long term adjuvant imatinib mesylate in patients
      at significant risk for recurrence following complete resection of primary GIST. A total of
      85 adult patients, 18 years of age and older will be enrolled.Participants will take 400 mg
      of imatinib mesylate daily by mouth for a total of 5 years. At the conclusion of the
      treatment period, patients will be followed for 2 years for survival, status of response and
      antineoplastic treatments and quality of life.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients 18 years of age or older.

          2. Patient must have a histological diagnosis of primary GIST.

          3. The tumor must express KIT (CD117) protein by immunohistochemistry performed by
             central pathology.

          4. Patient must be at significant risk of tumor recurrence as defined by either:

               -  Primary GIST (any site): ≥ 2 cm and a mitotic rate of ≥ 5/50 HPF's

               -  Non-gastric primary GIST: ≥ 5cm

          5. Patient must have undergone complete gross resection of a primary GIST within 12
             weeks prior to first dose of imatinib study drug. The inclusion of R1 resections will
             be reviewed on a case by case basis by the Study Management Committee.

          6. Patient must have no evidence of metastatic GIST on either 1) a post-operative CT of
             the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast or 2) MRI of the abdomen
             and pelvis with intravenous contrast. CT or MRI must be performed within 8 weeks
             prior to first dose of imatinib study drug.

          7. Performance status 0 or 1 (ECOG)

          8. Patient must have the following post-operative laboratory values confirmed within 14
             days prior to first dose of imatinib study drug:

               -  total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN NOTE: Patients with elevated bilirubin secondary to
                  Gilbert's disease are eligible to participate in the study.

               -  ALT and AST &lt; 2.5 x ULN

               -  creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L

               -  platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L

          9. If patient is a cancer survivor, ALL of the following criteria apply:

               -  Patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies.

               -  No evidence of any prior malignancies for at least 3 years with no evidence of
                  recurrence (except for effectively treated basal cell or squamous carcinoma of
                  the skin, carcinoma in-situ of the cervix that has been effectively treated by
                  surgery alone, or lobular carcinoma in-situ of the ipsilateral or contralateral
                  breast treated by surgery alone).

               -  Patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk for recurrence
                  from prior malignancies.

         10. Female patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before initiation of study drug dosing. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Female
             patients of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier method
             of birth control throughout the study and for up to 7 days following discontinuation
             of study drug.

         11. Written, voluntary informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has metastatic GIST to the peritoneum, liver, lymph node, or other sites or
             recurrent GIST.

          2. Prior treatment for GIST with the exception of prior treatment with imatinib adjuvant
             lasting ≤ 8 weeks following gross surgical resection.

          3. Patient has received any other investigational agents within 28 days of first day of
             study drug dosing.

          4. Patient with Grade III/IV cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart
             Association Criteria. (i.e., congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6
             months of study)

          5. Patients with severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease that in the
             opinion of the investigator could cause unacceptable safety risk or compromise
             compliance with the protocol (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, chronic renal disease,
             chronic liver disease, or active uncontrolled infection).

          6. Patient has a known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          7. Patient receiving concurrent treatment with warfarin (acceptable alternative:
             low-molecular weight heparin).

          8. Patient with any significant history of non-compliance to medical regimens or with
             inability to grant reliable informed consent.
