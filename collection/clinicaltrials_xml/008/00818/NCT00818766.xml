    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis decrease
      infectious complications when compared to pre-operative antibiotics alone, in patients
      undergoing elective thoracic surgery requiring tube thoracostomy (chest tube).

      There is currently no evidence-based standard for the extended use of prophylactic
      antibiotics in patients receiving thoracic surgery that results in the placement of a tube
      thoracostomy (chest tube). The rationale for this prophylaxis is that antibiotics directed
      at typical skin flora may reduce the rate of infectious complications, such as surgical site
      infection and empyema.

      Currently, clinicians' approach to post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients
      undergoing tube thoracostomy associated with thoracic and cardio-thoracic surgery varies
      widely. While reducing the infectious complications of thoracic surgery is an important
      goal, it is also important to reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics. As there is
      equipoise on the subject of extended antibiotic prophylaxis for tube thoracostomy, our study
      will examine two prevailing clinical practices and attempt to determine if one leads to
      better patient outcomes.

          -  Undergoing thoracic surgery procedure expected to require tube thoracostomy.

          -  Ability to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Decortication

               -  Chemical pleurodesis

               -  Pleurectomy

               -  Lung volume reduction

               -  Esophagectomy

          -  Patients with the following conditions:

               -  Prior diagnosis of empyema or lung abscess.

               -  Cystic fibrosis

               -  Known or suspected pneumonia pre-operatively.

               -  Known hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin

               -  Current or recent antibiotic use within one week of surgery.

               -  Anticipated requirement for postoperative antibiotic in addition to 48 hours of
                  cefazolin or vancomycin.
