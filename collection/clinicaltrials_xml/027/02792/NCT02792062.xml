    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 clinical pharmacological study of TAK-385 in Japanese premenopausal
      healthy adult women.

      Using an open-label 3Ã—3 crossover design, food effect on the pharmacokinetics and safety of
      TAK-385 will be evaluated in participants receiving a single oral dose of TAK-385 40 mg in
      fasted condition without breakfast, before breakfast, or after breakfast.

      Participants determined to be eligible will be randomly assigned to one of Groups A to F
      prior to study medication administration in Period 1; subsequently, participants will
      receive one TAK-385 40 mg tablet in fasted condition without breakfast (following a minimum
      10-hour overnight fast), before breakfast (30 minutes before starting breakfast), or after
      breakfast (30 minutes after starting breakfast) in Periods 1, 2, and 3.

         20. The participant has undergone whole blood collection of at least 400 mL in total
             within 52 weeks (364 days) prior to the start of study medication administration in

         21. The participant has undergone blood component collection within 2 weeks (14 days)
             prior to the start of study medication administration in Period 1.
