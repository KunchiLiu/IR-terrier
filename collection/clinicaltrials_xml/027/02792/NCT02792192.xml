      This Phase Ib/II study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      immunogenicity, patient reported outcomes (PROs), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of
      atezolizumab administered by intravenous (IV) infusion alone or in combination with
      intravesical BCG in high-risk NMIBC participants.
