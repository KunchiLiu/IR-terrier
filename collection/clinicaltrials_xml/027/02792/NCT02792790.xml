    <textblock>
      The investigators will prospectively evaluate tissue samples obtained from patients
      undergoing carpal tunnel release surgery for amyloid in the soft tissue that is removed.
      Patients who have tissue that stains positive for amyloid will undergo cardiac testing to
      look for evidence of cardiac involvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the 1970s, the connection between amyloidosis and carpal tunnel syndrome has been
      described, with tenosynovial tissue staining positive for amyloid fibril deposition. Up to
      30% of patients in prior studies with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome have biopsy tissue
      that stains positive for amyloid deposition. However, the prevalence of cardiac involvement
      at the time of carpal tunnel syndrome surgery has not been established. Furthermore, the
      role of TTR kinetic stability in the disease progression of amyloidosis is unclear.

      Diagnosing TTR amyloidosis at the time of carpal tunnel involvement could lead to an earlier
      identification of the disease at a stage where the cardiomyopathy may be occult or less
      advanced. In addition, abnormal TTR kinetics may even precede tissue deposition in the
      flexor tendon retinaculum. As several emerging pharmacological strategies are in development
      that may slow or even halt TTR amyloidosis, earlier diagnosis is advantageous.
      Identification and implementation of therapy for prevention or early disease treatment may
      alter the natural history of this progressive systemic disease.
