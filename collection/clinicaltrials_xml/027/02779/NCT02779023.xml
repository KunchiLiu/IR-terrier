    <textblock>
      This study investigates the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of adding
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) to the standard care received at the
      Integrative Cardiac Health Project (ICHP) on insomnia symptoms and severity. ICHP is an
      established cardiovascular disease prevention program to reduce cardiovascular disease risk
      through the adoption of lifestyle changes related to improvements in diet, stress, sleep,
      and exercise. The study will be conducted among patients with insomnia who are already
      enrolled in the ICHP cardiovascular risk prevention program.

      This is a single-center study, prospective, randomized, controlled, interventional trial
      within ICHP at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). To conduct both
      phases of the study, up to 64 total male and female patients enrolled in ICHP who meet
      criteria for insomnia will be recruited. Participants who meet inclusion and exclusion
      criteria for this study, and consent to participate, will be randomized to one of two
      conditions: (1) ICHP, or (2) ICHP + CBT-I treatment. CBT-I treatment will consist of four
      in-person appointments and two telephone appointments.
