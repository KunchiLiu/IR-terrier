      This study evaluates the difference between adductor canal blocks, with or without
      intravenous dexamethasone administered, and continuous adductor canal infusions for patients
      having total knee arthroplasties, ascertaining the decrease in opioid consumption. It's a
      three arm study, with a third of patients receiving a single shot adductor canal block, a
      third receiving single shot plus intravenous dexamethasone and the rest a continuous
      adductor canal local anesthetic infusion.

      1. Purpose

           To determine whether single shot adductor canal nerve blocks with intravenous
           dexamethasone are non-inferior to continuous adductor canal blockade, and whether
           either of the above are superior to single shot adductor canal nerve blocks alone.

        2. Hypotheses

           The use of adductor canal nerve block with intravenous dexamethasone will not be
           inferior to continuous adductor canal blockade for opioid requirements post
           operatively. Secondary hypothesis is that adductor canal nerve block with intravenous
           dexamethasone or continuous adductor canal blockade will be superior to adductor canal
           nerve block alone.

        3. Justification

           Total knee arthroplasty is a very commonly performed operation in North America, with a
           high propensity for postoperative pain. Inadequate analgesia limits functional recovery
           and leads to delays in hospital discharge, as a result of poor mobility. Effective
           analgesia allows for earlier mobilisation and improved postoperative recovery, with a
           multimodal regime being the ideal method to achieve this.

           Currently a multimodal regime is provided to patients, intraoperatively with a
           neuraxial technique (spinal anaesthesia), along with surgeon infiltrated local
           anaesthetic at the end of the operation, and then postoperatively using systemic
           opioids via patient controlled analgesia (PCA). Opioids have many side effects,
           including nausea and vomiting, sedation, respiratory depression and urinary retention.
           These all lead to delay in ambulation and recovery.

           Many centres now incorporate peripheral nerve blocks as part of a multimodal analgesic
           regime, with continuous femoral nerve blockade being commonly used for analgesia. This
           does decrease the amount of postoperative opioid used, but has the downside of causing
           quadriceps muscle weakness leading to an increased risk of falls and delayed
           ambulation. For this reason, there has been an increase in the use of adductor canal
           block, a nerve block of the distal femoral nerve at the mid-thigh level, that has been
           shown to preserve quadriceps function much better than a femoral nerve block, whilst
           still ensuring decreased opioid use. To date, studies have not compared single shot
           adductor canal block with continuous adductor canal blockade, but both have been shown
           to be comparable to femoral nerve blockade, whilst decreasing the likelihood of
           quadriceps muscle weakness.

           Further to this, it has been shown that the addition of dexamethasone, administered via
           the intravenous or perineural route to peripheral nerve blockade, prolongs the duration
           of analgesia. Perineural administration of dexamethasone is an off label use and there
           is also a theoretic risk of neurotoxicity from dexamethasone itself. Findings to date
           indicate that the efficacy of dexamethasone administered intravenously is non-inferior
           to perineural injection. Both routes prolong the analgesic benefit of peripheral nerve
           blocks with similar reductions in opioid requirements.

           As stated before, currently at Vancouver Coastal Health, opioid PCA is the most
           commonly used modality for postoperative analgesia following total knee arthroplasty.
           The information from this study will enable ascertainment of the best method for
           allowing patients good functional recovery, whilst minimising opioid side effects.

        4. Objectives

           The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of adductor canal nerve block,
           with and without intravenous dexamethasone, and continuous adductor canal blockade with
           a catheter to ascertain cumulative opioid consumption post-operatively.

           The secondary aims are to compare the quality of anaesthesia recovery using the QoR-40
           questionnaire administered at 48 hours postoperatively, length of hospital stay,
           complications of nerve blockade, incidence of catheter dislodgement and opioid side
           effects with the different techniques.

        5. Research Methods

           Trial Design

           This will be a randomised, non-blinded control trial, involving patients having primary
           unilateral total knee arthroplasty.

           Setting

           This will be a single-centre trial at UBC Hospital (UBCH).

           B. Randomisation

           Prior to surgery, for each consented patient, a sealed unmarked opaque envelope will be
           opened to determine the modality of analgesia that the patient will receive. The
           patients will either receive an adductor canal block postoperatively, an adductor canal
           block postoperatively along with intravenous dexamethasone, or have an adductor canal
           catheter placed postoperatively for continuous adductor canal blockade.

           D. Data Collection

           Demographic data including patient age, sex, height, weight, BMI, and medications
           including analgesics will be obtained from patients. Comorbidities and American Society
           of Anaesthesia (ASA) scores will be determined from the anaesthetic record.

           Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores from 0-10 as well as cumulative opioid
           consumption in morphine equivalents will be determined at set time points of 12, 24, 48
           hours. The data will be determined from the patient's pain flow sheet and medication
           administration record (MAR), which are part of the standard charting found on the
           hospital ward. This charting will also be used to ascertain side effects from opioids,
           along with anti-emetic medication administered. Time to first mobilisation will be
           determined from the physiotherapy or nursing records. At 48 hours, all participants
           will be provided with a QoR-40 questionnaire, a validated 40 item questionnaire on the
           quality of recovery from anaesthesia. The time of discharge will also be recorded as
           days following the surgery.

           Complications from adductor canal catheters will be recorded, such as catheter
           dislodgement and site infection. For patients unable to complete the study, the reason
           will be noted and data will be included in an intention to treat analysis.

           E. Statistical Analysis

           Sample Size The investigators currently do not have previous data confirming a standard
           deviation (SD) of morphine equivalent consumption for primary total knee arthroplasty.
           Based on a previous study, the standard deviation of morphine equivalent consumption at
           48h is estimated to be 20mg and with a non-inferiority limit of 10mg. Using the
           following online calculator:
           https://www.sealedenvelope.com/power/continuous-noninferior/ based on a power of 80%
           and significance level of 5%, the number of patients required per group is 50. The aim
           is to recruit 60 patients per group to account for potential drop outs. The intention
           is to reanalyze sample size after 30 patients, thereby giving a better estimation of
           SD, which may further affect the power of the sample size.

        6. Data Analysis

      Categorical data will be analysed with chi-squared tests. Numeric variables will be compared
      with independent T-tests if distributions were normal. If Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test for
      normality of distribution was significant non-parametric Mann Whitney U tests will be
      utilized. Statistical significance will be assumed if P &lt;0.05.
