  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to learn more about the different ways in which people process
      information that is stressful and rewarding, and how abnormalities in these two processes
      are related to depression.

      Participants will participate in two 3-hour sessions separated by a week at Providence Care,
      Mental Health Services, and a third, 1.5-hour session at the Queen's MRI Facility. At the
      first session participants will complete a packet of questionnaires about their mood and
      take part in an interview about their mood, medications, drug use, and any other symptoms,
      as well as an interview about their relationships with their parents and any experiences of
      abuse. At the second session participants will participate in a stress test, which involves
      giving a speech to a panel. The investigators will also collect saliva samples to look at
      stress hormones. Participants will also complete a task on the computer that involves
      looking at cartoon faces and making decisions about them. At the third session, the
      investigators take images of of participant's brain using a magnetic resonance scanner.

      Participants are invited to participate in a 6-month follow-up for this study, which would
      involve the same procedure as outline above.
