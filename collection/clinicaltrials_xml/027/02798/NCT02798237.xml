  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity level is an important determinant of quality of life in persons
      post-stroke. There is a lack of knowledge regarding the effects of overground walking
      aerobic training on physical activity level and cardiorespiratory fitness in post-stroke
      subjects. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effects of aerobic overground
      training, aerobic treadmill training and overground training to improve physical activity
      level, cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance, mobility, quality of life and participation in
      participants post-stroke. A randomized controlled trial with blinded assessment will assign
      eligible participants to either: 1) aerobic overground training, 2) aerobic treadmill
      training, or 3) control group (overground walking). Participants will receive three 40
      minutes sessions per week on 60-80% of heart rate reserve (groups-1 and 2), and below 40%
      (group-3) over 12-weeks. At baseline, post-intervention, and at 4-week follow-up researchers
      blinded to group allocations will collect the following outcome measures: physical activity
      level, cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance, mobility, quality of life and participation. We
      hypothesize that the two aerobic training groups (overground and treadmill), would have an
      increase on physical activity level and on cardiorespiratory fitness (peak VO2), as well as
      endurance, mobility, quality of life and participation. In addition, the control group would
      not improve in any of these outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>

      Sample size: cardiorespiratory fitness (peak VO2) was used as the primary outcome measure to
      determine the sample size which has been derived from the aerobic treadmill training study
      of Globas et al. on post-stroke subjects. In this randomized controlled trial, the
      experimental group (n=18) showed an increase on peak VO2 on average of 5.5 ± 4.6 mL/kg/min,
      and the control group (n=18) had an average reduction of 0.8 ± 7.8 mL/kg/min. Using α=0.05
      and β=0.80, a number of 13 participants per group is required. Assuming a dropout rate of
      15%, 45 participants (15 participants per group) will be recruited.

      Statistical analyses: A code will be given to each participant. Two independent examiners
      will perform data entry, and will verify missing or apparently wrong values. Original paper
      forms will be kept in a secure place. Electronic files will be available only to the
      research team. An independent examiner, blinded to the group allocation, will perform
      statistical analysis by SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Descriptive statistics and tests for
      normality will be employed. Baseline variables will be compared between groups using One-way
      ANOVA. The effects of the trainings will be analyzed from the collected data and the
      analysis of intention-to-treat. Data from the last available assessment will be considered
      as the values of sessions lost by dropouts. Between-groups differences will be measured with
      two-way ANOVA (α=0.05) with repeated measures considering the baseline, post-training and
      follow-up. Study results will be spread regardless of the magnitude or direction of effect.
