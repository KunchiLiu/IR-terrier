        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of STS for which olaratumab and doxorubicin
             would be appropriate therapy. Participants with a diagnosis of Grade 1 liposarcoma
             are eligible if there is histological or radiographic evidence of evolution to more
             aggressive disease. Participants with Kaposi's sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal
             tumors (GIST) will be excluded. Participants must have potentially resectable disease
             (as assessed by the study investigator) and have a primary tumor lesion deemed
             amenable to serial biopsy.

          -  Have consented to undergo mandatory serial peripheral whole blood and tumor tissue
             sampling.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastasis (brain
             metastasis) at the time of enrollment. Participants with a history of a CNS
             metastasis previously treated with curative intent (for example, stereotactic
             radiation or surgery) that have not progressed on follow-up imaging, have been
             asymptomatic for at least 60 days and are not receiving systemic corticosteroids and
             or/anticonvulsants, are eligible. Participants with signs or symptoms of neurological
             compromise should have appropriate radiographic imaging performed before enrollment
             to rule out brain metastasis.

          -  Have received prior treatment with doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, and/or other
             anthracyclines or anthracenediones; the participant has received treatment with
             olaratumab or has participated in a prior olaratumab trial.
