      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate using polysomnography (PSG) that 10 mg
      lemborexant is superior to zolpidem tartrate extended release 6.25 mg (Ambien CR®) on
      objective sleep maintenance as assessed by wake after sleep onset in the second half of the
      night (WASO2H) after the last 2 nights of treatment in participants 55 years and older with
      insomnia disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator,
      parallel-group study of 2 dose levels of lemborexant for approximately 6 weeks in
      approximately 950 participants, 55 years or older with insomnia disorder. Participants will
      be males 65 years or older or females 55 years or older. At least 60% of the participants
      will be age 65 years or older. The study will have 2 phases: The Prerandomization Phase and
      the Randomization Phase. Including both phases, the study will last for a minimum of 65 and
      a maximum of 81 days per participant.

             presence of narcolepsy

          3. On the Munich Parasomnia Scale (MUPS), (a) a history of symptoms of Rapid Eye
             Movement (REM) Behavior Disorder, sleep-related violent behavior, sleep-driving, or

          9. Excessive caffeine use that in the opinion of the investigator contributes to the
             participant's insomnia, or habitually consumes caffeine-containing beverages after

             gastrointestinal, renal, neurological or psychiatric disease or malignancy other than
             basal cell carcinoma) or chronic pain that in the opinion of the investigator(s)
             could affect the participant's safety or interfere with the study assessments,
             including the ability to perform tasks on the cognitive performance assessment
             battery (PAB)

         13. Comorbid nocturia resulting in frequent need to get out of bed to use the bathroom
             during the night

         14. Used any prohibited prescription or over-the-counter concomitant medications within 1
             week before the first dose of study medication. (A list of prohibited concomitant
             medications is presented in Appendix 3 of the protocol)
