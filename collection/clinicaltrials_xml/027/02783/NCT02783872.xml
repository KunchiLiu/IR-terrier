      This study will investigate neural activation patterns in emotion- and cognition-related
      brain regions during an emotion regulation task involving cognitive reappraisal, and their
      associations with age and pubertal status, among overweight children and adolescents with
      loss of control eating as compared to overweight and normal-weight controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Right-handed, aged 10-17 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be excluded if they

          -  are currently taking any medications known to affect mood or weight (e.g.,
             antidepressants, steroids);

          -  have a current diagnosis of a mood disorder or an eating disorder involving purging
             or suppressed body weight (e.g., bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa);

          -  are unable to read and understand English fluently;

          -  are currently pregnant;

          -  are a current smoker; or

          -  have metallic foreign bodies, face or neck tattoos, or other conditions that would
             prohibit fMRI scanning. Participants will complete a mock scan (see below) to ensure
             that their head and trunk size can be comfortably accommodated in the scanner.
