    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in Taiwan. Early diagnosis
      of lung cancer may improve cancer survival. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) was thought
      to be the best screening tool for lung cancer. However, there is growing concerns about
      radiation exposure, high cost, and high rate of false-positive screening result.
      Epidemiology data for LDCT screening in Taiwan is lacking.

      National Taiwan University Hospital Chu-Tung Branch (NTUHCT) initiated the lung cancer
      screening by LDCT since June 2015. Many people can get the LDCT screening with affordable
      price with the subsidy from enterprise donation. The purpose of this study is establishing
      local epidemiological result via telephone follow-up and patients' medical records
      retrospectively.

      National Taiwan University Hospital Chu-Tung Branch (NTUHCT) initiated the lung cancer
      screening by LDCT since June 2015. Many people can get the LDCT screening with affordable
      price with the subsidy from enterprise donation. The purpose of this study is establishing
      local epidemiological result via telephone follow-up and patients' medical records
      retrospectively.

      Aim: To establish the local epidemiological data for lung pathology, emphysema,
      bronchiectasis and other lung disease.

      Methods: Since June 2015, more than 6000 LDCT were done at the NTUHCT. Roughly 6 months
      after the test telephone follow-ups about patient satisfactions, self-awareness of CT
      results, medical consultations and other related behaviors, and willingness of coming back
      for another test were routinely done. Retrospective secondary data analysis will be
      performed on the telephone follow-up results to establish local epidemiology data on lung
      pathology as well as information on screening accuracy of LDCT. Customers are also queried
      about willingness to provide their medical records, and linkage to National Health Insurance
      Database with informed consents to provide more advanced information on their long-term
      outcomes.

      Keywords: Lung cancer, Low dose computed tomography, screening.
