  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ubenimex is being developed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
      (World Health Organization [WHO] Group 1) to improve exercise capacity and delay clinical
      worsening. This study is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, extension study to evaluate
      long-term safety and efficacy of ubenimex in patients with PAH (WHO Group 1) who complete
      Study EIG-UBX-001 (Study EIG-UBX-001 is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial) and meet the eligibility criteria for Study EIG-UBX-002.
      The primary objective for this study is:

      - to obtain long-term safety and tolerability data for ubenimex (150 mg administered three
      times daily [TID]) in patients with PAH (WHO Group 1).
