      This study is designed as a randomized double-blinded treatment trial among travelers' to
      geographical areas with moderate-severe rates of traveler's diarrhea. Travelers will be
      randomized to receive Bimuno® or masked placebo to be taken daily while traveling. The test
      article or placebo will be taken starting 7 days prior to travel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy subjects, 18 years old or older

          2. Travel on moderate-high risk itinerary for traveler's diarrhea for minimum of 14 days
             and maximum of 6 weeks travel

          3. Able to comply with study and follow-up procedures

          4. Subjects willing and able to enter data in the diary card

          5. An IRB approved informed consent form is signed and dated

          6. Subjects must have adequate general health (as determined by investigators)

          7. Women: Non-nursing and negative urine/serum pregnancy test with understanding through
             informed consent process to avoid pregnancy during the study while on the study drug.
             Should an individual have a documented surgical sterilization in her medical record,
             a pregnancy test will not be required. If a volunteer becomes pregnant during the
             study, the Principal Investigator (PI) will notify the study research monitor and the
             Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). The pregnancy outcome will be followed per IRB
             and other regulatory requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Allergy to investigational product

          2. History of functional bowel disorder (including IBS)

          3. Chronic intestinal disease (ulcerative colitis, crohn's disease), post vagotomy
             diabetic autonomic neuropathy, malabsorption, short bowel syndrome, celiac disease,
             bacterial overgrowth due to blind loops, pancreatitis

          4. Antibiotic use within 7 days prior to enrollment (except for malaria prophylaxis
             excluding doxycycline)

          5. Use of other probiotics or prebiotics (outside of the study product) in the prior
             3-weeks or intent to use during the study period. This includes the over-the-counter
             preparations of probiotics, prebiotics (including inulin, lactulose) or consumption
             of a bio-yogurt product.

          6. Lactose intolerant (allergies to dairy products).

          7. Medications usage as deemed by the PI to interfere with GI function

          8. Diarrheal illness within 7 days prior to enrollment

          9. Subject has a concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with or for which
             treatment could interfere with the conduct of the study, or could in the opinion of
             the investigator increase the risk of adverse events (AEs) during the subject's
             participation in the study.

         10. Use of any investigational or non-registered drug other than the study drug within 30
             days preceding the study enrollment.
