      This study is an observational study evaluating the clinical outcomes of mucosal sparing
      proton beam therapy (PBT) after resection of favorable risk oropharyngeal cancer patients.
      Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested qualified
      subjects will be consented and offered participation in this study. Once consent has been
      obtained baseline adverse event and Quality of Life (QOL) data will be collected and
      subjects will undergo adjuvant PBT and follow-up at 3 months, 12 months, and 24 months. No
      study-specific visits or evaluations will be required. Patients will be evaluated according
      to the physician's standard practice and discretion. Patient data will be drawn from the
      patients' medical records and reported by means of a web-based electronic data collection
      (EDC) system. Patients will be considered &quot;on study&quot; until 24 months of observation has
      occurred, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or study closure.
