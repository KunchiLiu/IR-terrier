  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assesses patients with cured pulmonary tuberculosis by compulsory notification
      data of Uberlândia (Minas Gerais state - Brazil) from 2013, 2014 and 2015. These patients
      will be randomly selected and invited by telephonic contact. After eligibility and exclusion
      criteria evaluation, those included will be assessed in order to know structural and
      functional repercussions of pulmonary tuberculosis sequelae.

      This study evaluates structural and functional repercussions of pulmonary tuberculosis
      sequelae by chest imaging (computed tomography and radiograph), functional respiratory tests
      (spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide and cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing) in patients with cured pulmonary tuberculosis.

    <description>High resolution computed tomography of the lungs will be evaluated by radiologists and the extent of pulmonary abnormalities will be score subjectively.
Spirometry will permit assessment of lung volumes: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pulmonary tuberculosis with completed treatment (patients that received at least six
             months of treatment and with confirmed cure by negative culture and/or sputum smear,
             or clinical and radiological improvement after well succeed treatment);
