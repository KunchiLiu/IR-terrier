  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the association of functional outcomes measures, return to work status, pain
      scores and hardware failure on early protected and unrestricted weight bearing versus
      delayed weight bearing in operatively repaired rotational Bimalleolar and Trimalleolar ankle
      fractures not requiring fixation of the syndesmosis.

      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized into two groups: early weight
      bearing and delayed weight bearing. Participants will receive standard of care treatment for
      fixation of their ankle fractures and will be discharged from the hospital as non-weight
      bearing. Participants in the early weight bearing group will be allowed to begin
      unrestricted, protected weight bearing in a Controlled Ankle Motion (CAM) Walker or a
      walking cast at the two week follow up visit. Participants in the delayed weight bearing
      group will allowed to begin unrestricted, protected weight bearing at the 6 week follow up
      visit. Follow up will occur at 2w, 6w, 3m, 6m, and 12m post-operatively and will include
      physical assessments and functional outcome surveys.
