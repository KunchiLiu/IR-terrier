  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of OTX-DP as a sustained release drug (dexamethasone)
      depot when placed in the canaliculus of the eyelid for the treatment of post-surgical
      inflammation and pain in subjects who have undergone cataract extraction with intra-ocular
      lens implantation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The anterior chamber will be examined for the presence of signs of ocular inflammation. Anterior chamber cell count and flare will be graded using the SUN* Working Group grading scheme: 0, 0.5+, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Although an anterior chamber cell grade of &quot;0&quot; is reported as &quot;&lt; 1 cell&quot; in the SUN Working Group grading scheme, it will be characterized as 0 cells in the field for this study. The anterior chamber cell count will be assessed as the actual number of cells counted within the slit beam of 1.0 mm height and 1.0 mm width, if fewer than 16 cells are seen. Only white blood cells will be counted. (Red blood cells and pigment cells are not to be counted)</description>
