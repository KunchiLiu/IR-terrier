    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability and determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended fixed dose of the combinations of
      mogamulizumab and nivolumab in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2 open-label, dose-finding and cohort expansion study of the
      anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab in combination therapy with the anti-PD-1 antibody
      nivolumab in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Phase 1 will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined dose
      in absence of exceeding the MTD, of the combination regimen of mogamulizumab and nivolumab
      subjects. Phase 1 will enroll up to 12 subjects. Phase 2 will explore the safety, efficacy
      and anti-tumor activity of the highest tolerated dose of the combination regimen. Phase 2
      will enroll up to 184 subjects.
