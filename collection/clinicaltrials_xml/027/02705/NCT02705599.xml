  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the stroke mechanism evolution in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic
      stenosis by magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) from current first stroke to follow up stroke
      recurrence. Diffusion weighted imaging was to identify basic stroke mechanism. High
      resolution MRI and perfusion imaging was to monitor the dynamic changes of vulnerable
      atherosclerotic plaque and hemodynamic status including antegrade flow and collateral
      circulation.

      Patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis were
      included. Baseline materials including risk factors, NIH stroke scale score, modified Rankin
      Scale at admission, time from sympton onset to imaging were recorded. Current stroke
      mechanism was identified by diffusion weighted imaging as In situ thrombotic occlusion,
      artery-to-artery embolism, hemodynamic impairment, branch occlusive disease and mixed
      mechanism. High resolution MRI(HRMRI) was to detect atherosclerotic plaque and depict plaque
      characteristics and vulnerability. Perfusion imaging was to monitor the dynamic changes
      hemodynamic status including antegrade flow and collateral circulation.

      Imaging protocols:

      T2 weighted imaging, T1 weighted imaging, Diffusion weighted image(DWI), fluid-attenuated
      inversion recovery(FLAIR), three dimensional high resolution black blood T1 weighted
      imaging, Perfusion weighted image(PWI), arterial spin labeling(ASL) with Post labeling
      delay(PLD) 1.5s and 2.5s, Territory ASL(TASL) (PLD = 2.0s), 3D inversion recovery
      (IR)-prepared fast spoiled gradient recalled echo (FSPGR).

      Contrast agent: Omniscan 2ml/kg, Inject rate：3ml/s

      Imaging evaluation:

        1. Antegrade flow and collateral assessment by ASL Cerebral blood flow(CBF) maps and TASL
           CBF maps.

        2. Hemodynamic status assessment by PWI multi-parameter postprocessing map.

        3. FLAIR hyperintensity vascular sign.

      Treatment:

      Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator(rtPA), endovascular therapy and
      conventional treatment including neuro protection, ante-platelet and statin.

      Follow up:

      A month imaging follow up and clinical stroke event and modified Rankin Scale(mRS) record in
      2 years.

      Imaging sequences optimization:

      Three dimensional high resolution black blood T1 weighted imaging and ASL imaging quality
      evaluation and parameters optimization.
