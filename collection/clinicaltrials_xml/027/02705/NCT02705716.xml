    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy of an experimental dentifrice containing 0.454%
      weight/weight (w/w) stannous fluoride in relieving dentine hypersensitivity (DH) after twice
      daily brushing, over a 2 week treatment period compared with a standard fluoride dentifrice.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Schiff sensitivity score on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Schiff sensitivity score was assessed by examiner as participant's response to an evaporative (air) stimulus after the stimulation of each individual tooth. Response of participant was scored using Schiff sensitivity scale range of 0-3; 0=Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1=Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2=Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3= Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in tactile threshold on Day 7 and 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Tactile threshold was assessed by examiner using a constant pressure probe (Yeaple probe) which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface from 10 g to an upper threshold of 80g in increments of 10 g. The tactile threshold is the maximum pressure applied at which participant do not report any pain or discomfort. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold.</description>
