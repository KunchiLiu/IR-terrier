             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs from the combination of
             MEDI0562 and durvalumab or tremelimumab, or compromise the ability of the subject to
             give written informed consent.

         17. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
