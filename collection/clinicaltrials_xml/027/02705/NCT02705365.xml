      To develop and implement a patient navigator (PN) program for lung screening and smoking
      cessation in community health center primary care practices. This program will be evaluated
      in a randomized controlled trial of primary care patients who currently smoke.

      The specific aims of this study are:

      Specific Aim 1: To develop a patient navigator (PN) program for lung screening for patients
      who are current smokers, aged 55-77 years, potentially eligible for lung screening and are
      receiving care at community health centers (CHCs) affiliated with MGH.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the new lung screening PN program in
      improving screening rates and increasing use of tobacco cessation services in a randomized
      controlled trial.

      Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate that equity is maintained in rates of lung screening and in
      follow up of abnormal chest CT results, comparing eligible smokers from CHCs with eligible
      smokers from other practices within the MGH primary care network.

    <description>Patients assigned to the patient navigator (PN) arm will be sent a letter about the program with lung screening educational materials. The PN will educate eligible patients about lung screening, explore barriers to screening, coordinate scheduling an appointment with a provider, and possibly attend the visit with the patient. The PN will further coordinate scheduling the CT scan, help the patient obtain the test, and access any required follow-up. The PN will assess the patient's interest in quitting smoking and if so, offer and help to connect the smoker to existing cessation resources in the community and provide follow-up contacts to monitor adherence to treatments.</description>

             centers.
