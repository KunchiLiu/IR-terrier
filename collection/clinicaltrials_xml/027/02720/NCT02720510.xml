  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II study which will enroll 112 newly
      diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma patients in a 1:1 fashion. Patients will be enrolled
      at approximately 20 centers in the United States.

      Patients will undergo stem cell mobilization with plerixafor plus Granulocyte Colony
      Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), according to investigator discretion, after 4 cycles of
      induction therapy. Study treatment interruption for stem cell collection may not exceed 30
      days. All patients will receive one additional cycle of study treatment after stem cell
      collection and then proceed to autologous transplant using melphalan 200mg/m2(140mg/m2 for
      patients &gt; 70 years), as conditioning.

      After Autologus Stem Cell Transplant( ASCT), patients still on study will initiate
      maintenance therapy within the 60-120 day period following ASCT, provided they have adequate
      blood count and clinical recovery. Patients in the RVD arm will initiate maintenance therapy
      with lenalidomide alone, and patients in RVD-panobinostat arm will receive lenalidomide +
      panobinostat maintenance. Lenalidomide will be dosed orally at 10mg/day continuously in both
      arms, increasing to 15mg/day after the first 84 day cycle. Panobinostat will be dosed at
      10mg three times a week, every other week. Total planned duration of maintenance therapy
      will be 3 years.

      Patients will remain on study treatment until they complete the maintenance phase, or until
      they experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or at the discretion of the
      Investigator.
