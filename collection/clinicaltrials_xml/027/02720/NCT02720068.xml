    <textblock>
      This is a safety and pharmacokinetics study of MK-4280 as monotherapy and in combination
      with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with metastatic solid tumors for which there is no
      available therapy which may convey clinical benefit. Part A of this study is a dose
      escalation design in which participants receive MK-4280 as monotherapy or MK-4280 in
      combination with pembrolizumab. Part B is a dose confirmation design to estimate the
      recommended Phase 2 dose for MK-4280 in combination with pembrolizumab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Part A - Has histologically or cytologically-confirmed metastatic solid tumor for
             which there is no available therapy which may convey clinical benefit.

          -  Has measureable disease by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (irRECIST) 1.1 criteria.

          -  Has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Scale.

          -  Demonstrates adequate organ function

          -  If female of child-bearing potential, is willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of
             study drug.

          -  If male with a female partner(s) of child-bearing potential, must agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through
             120 days after the last dose of study drug. Males with pregnant partners must agree
             to use a condom; no additional method of contraception is required for the pregnant
             partner.

          -  Must submit an evaluable baseline tumor sample for analysis (either a recent or
             archival tumor sample).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has had chemotherapy, radiation or biological cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to
             the first dose of study drug, or has not recovered to Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 or better from the AEs due to cancer therapeutics
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier (this includes participants with previous
             immunomodulatory therapy with residual immune-related [ir]AEs).

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study

             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.

          -  Has received previous treatment with another agent targeting the
             lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) receptor.

          -  Has received previous treatment with an immunomodulatory therapy (e.g.
             anti-programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1]/anti-PD-ligand 1 [PD-L1] or cytotoxic
             T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA 4] agent) and was discontinued from that
             therapy due to a Grade 3 or higher irAE.

          -  Is expected to require any other form of antineoplastic therapy while on study.

          -  Is on chronic systemic steroid therapy in excess of replacement doses, or on any

             cancers.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis.

          -  Has had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another monoclonal
             antibody.

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease,
             except vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy.

          -  Has an active infection requiring therapy.

          -  Has active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has had a prior stem cell or bone marrow transplant.

          -  Has a known history of or screens positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
             active chronic or acute Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the study.

          -  Is a regular user as determined by investigator judgment (including &quot;recreational
             use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last year) of
             substance abuse (including alcohol), at the time of signing informed consent.

          -  Has symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A participant who is clinically stable
             following treatment for these conditions (including therapeutic thoraco- or
             paracentesis) is eligible. For participants receiving pembrolizumab: Has interstitial
             lung disease or a history of pneumonitis that required oral or IV glucocorticoids to
             assist with management.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study.

          -  Has clinically significant heart disease that affects normal activities.

          -  Has had major surgery in the past 4 weeks.
