  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if GemRIS, an investigational drug-delivery system
      is safe and tolerable in patients with recurrent low or intermediate risk
      non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) between diagnosis and transurethral resection of
      bladder tumors (TURBT)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A documented history of histologically-confirmed low or intermediate risk urothelial
             carcinoma of the bladder, excluding carcinoma in situ (pTis), pathologic stage pT1
             (invasive into lamina propria) and high-Grade disease, judged not to be muscle
             infiltrating (pT2 or greater) and accessible for resection.

          -  Adequate laboratory parameters.

          -  Screening urinalysis showing no clinically significant abnormalities except those
             attributable to bladder cancer.

          -  Not undergoing active treatment in last 3 months for prior or concurrent neoplastic
             disease and have fully recovered from treatment effects. Patients undergoing
             concurrent hormonal therapy treatment for prostate cancer will be allowed to enroll.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exposure to BCG therapy and/or any other intravesical. chemotherapeutic agent less
             than 1 year prior to enrollment, except single postoperative instillations.

          -  Absence of visible tumor at Screening.

          -  Any previous exposure to intravesical gemcitabine instillations within the past 12
             months.

          -  Presence of any bladder or urethral anatomical feature that in the opinion of the
             investigator may prevent the safe placement, indwelling use or removal of GemRIS
             (i.e. bladder diverticula, complete incontinence).

          -  Patients with a high-Grade urine cytology at recurrence.

          -  Currently receiving other systemic or intravesical chemotherapy.

          -  Pelvic radiotherapy administered within 6 months prior to enrollment. Patients who
             received radiotherapy ≥ 6 months prior to enrollment must demonstrate no cystoscopic
             evidence or clinical symptoms of radiation cystitis.

          -  Bladder Post-Void Residual Volume (PVR) of &gt; 250-mL.

          -  Active, uncontrolled urogenital bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, including
             urinary tract infection. Patients must not have a UTI within one month prior to the
             GemRIS Insertion Visit, Study Day 0. Skin/nail fungal infections are not
             exclusionary. Patients with active shingles (varicella zoster infection) will be
             excluded from the study.

          -  History or presence of any significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, gynecological, endocrine, immunological, dermatological,
             neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, contraindicates participation.

          -  Concomitant immunosuppressive medications, such as methotrexate or TNF inhibitors,
             within 2 weeks of Study Day 0.

          -  Female subject who is pregnant (as verified by urine test at time of screening) or
             lactating, or of childbearing potential and not using acceptable methods of
             contraception.

          -  Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent or comply with the requirements of
             this protocol, including the presence of any condition (physical, mental or social)
             that is likely to affect the subject's return for scheduled visits and follow-up.

          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the investigator or TARIS, make the
             patient unsuitable for enrollment.
