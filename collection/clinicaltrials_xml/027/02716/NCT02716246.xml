      Self-complementary adeno-associated virus serotype 9 carrying the human SGSH gene under the
      control of a U1a promoter (scAAV9.U1a.hSGSH) will be delivered one time through a venous
      catheter inserted into a peripheral limb vein. The vector will be delivered undiluted
      approximately over 30 minutes, under light to moderate sedation as needed. Dosing volume
      will be approximately 0.5 to 1 mL/kg, depending on final vector product concentration and
      subject cohort. A tapering course of prophylactic enteral prednisone or prednisolone will be
      administered

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 2 years old or greater

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of MPS IIIA by either of two methods:

          -  No detectable or significantly reduced* SGSH enzyme activity by leukocyte or
             fibroblast assay.

          -  Genomic DNA analysis demonstrating homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in
             the SGSH gene

          -  Clinical history or examination features of neurologic dysfunction

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to participate in the clinical evaluation as determined by PI

          -  Presence of a concomitant medical condition that precludes lumbar puncture or use of
             anesthetics

          -  Inability to be safely sedated in the opinion of the clinical anesthesiologist

          -  Active viral infection based on clinical observations

          -  Concomitant illness or requirement for chronic drug treatment that in the opinion of
             the PI creates unnecessary risks for gene transfer

          -  Subjects with anti-AAV9 antibody titers ≥ 1:50 as determined by ELISA binding
             immunoassay

          -  Serology consistent with exposure to HIV, or serology consistent with active
             hepatitis A, B or C infection

          -  Bleeding disorder or any other medical condition or circumstance in which a lumbar
             puncture (for collection of CSF) is contraindicated according to local institutional
             policy

          -  Visual or hearing impairment sufficient to preclude cooperation with
             neurodevelopmental testing

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder, due to the requirement for multiple MRI examinations
             as part of the study protocol. Subjects who are stable on anticonvulsive medications
             may be included

          -  Any item (braces, etc.) which would exclude the patient from being able to undergo
             MRI according to local institutional policy

          -  Any item (braces, etc.) which would exclude the patient from being able to undergo
             MRI according to local institutional policy

          -  Patients with cardiomyopathy or significant congenital heart abnormalities

          -  The presence of significant non-MPS IlIA related CNS impairment or behavioral
             disturbances that would confound the scientific rigor or interpretation of results of
             the study

          -  Abnormal, clinically significant laboratory values based upon normal values in the
             Nationwide Children's Hospital Laboratory as listed in Table 1 of the protocol.

               -  Due to the nature of enzyme activity testing, normal ranges and reported units
                  vary from lab to lab. Many laboratories utilize control samples rather than
                  normal ranges, to account for the influence of small day-to-day fluctuations in
                  the laboratory environment.

               -  For the purposes of invitation to a screening visit, we will accept
                  &quot;significantly reduced&quot; results as those interpreted as such by any clinical
                  laboratory approved to perform this diagnostic test.

        For uniformity of data for analysis, and confirmation of accurate diagnosis before gene
        transfer, subjects who consent to complete the screening visit will have their blood drawn
        for confirmatory enzyme activity level to be performed by Greenwood Genetics Center
        Biochemical Laboratory. Subjects must have an enzyme activity level considered to be in
        the affected range by Greenwood Genetic Center Biochemical Laboratory to proceed within
        the study.
