  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe contemporary, real-world disease and participant
      presentation, therapies, and clinical outcomes in both participants with newly diagnosed and
      not yet relapsed [ND] multiple myeloma (MM), and participants with relapsed/refractory [R/R]
      MM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, observational. This study will look at contemporary,
      real-world presentation, therapies, and clinical outcomes in participants with MM.
      Participants will not be asked to change their routine clinical treatment. Participants will
      have to complete a patient self-reported outcomes (PROs) survey at home or during routine
      visits.

      The study will enroll approximately 5000 participants. Participants will be assigned to one
      of the following cohorts based upon the diagnosis of MM:

        -  ND MM

        -  R/R MM

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 5 years. Participants will be evaluated and followed-up for a period of at least 5
      years, until death, or the end of the study, whichever comes first.
