  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in Sweden. During investigation of
      suspected cancer transrectal ultrasound with needle biopsies from prostate leeds to
      diagnosis.

      The most common technique today is side-fire where the needle enter the prostate in angle
      from the probe. In end-fire technique the needle enters the prostate at tip of probe without
      angle. The difference in techniques side-fire vs. end-fire affects the possibility to reach
      the ventral and apical aspects of prostate.

      Today´s standard is at least five cores from each side of the prostate at first biopsy. If
      first sample is negative there will usually be another urological exam and a first
      re-biopsy.

      The study aim to compare these two methods in cancer detection. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that when using end-fire technique at first re-biopsy, investigators find more
      cancers compared to side-fire.

      Patients are prospectively randomized into two groups, both assessing 12 core biopsies
      according to study protocol.

      Primary endpoint is cancer detection. Data will be collected about patient age, PSA-level,
      prostate size, digital rectal exam, hypoechogenic zones and length of cancers.
