    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ST266 will reduce pocket depth (PD) as an
      adjunctive to scaling and root planing (SRP) in subjects with moderate to severe periodontal
      disease.

      The study is a 9-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel-design study of subjects with
      existing moderate to severe periodontal disease randomly assigned to one of three groups.
      The primary endpoint of PD change will be evaluated following 3 months of treatment.
      Subjects will be followed for 9 months for safety and radiographic evaluations.

      Subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of three treatment groups.
      Randomization will be stratified by site and smoker status (never smoked or quit smoking
      more than two years ago vs. has smoked within the last two years). Randomization will be
      blocked such that assignment to treatment groups both within sites and within smoker status
      will be approximately even (1:1:1). Treatment will be initiated after scaling and root
      planing (SRP).

      All subjects will be evaluated at baseline and Days 1, 15, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 270.
