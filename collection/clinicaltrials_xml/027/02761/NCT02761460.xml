      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PEG-rhG-CSF in
      preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia

    <textblock>
      Neutrophilic granulocytopenias is one of the most common and most serious complications in
      chemotherapy. Research shows that about 25% ~ 40% in patients receiving standard
      chemotherapy can appear neutropenia with fever. It can increase the risk of infection and
      Chemotherapy related death, and lead to the delay of chemotherapy, and maybe Reduce the
      curative effect of chemotherapy. RhG-CSF has widely used to prevent neutropenia, but its
      half-time is short, and need daily injections to maintain the effective blood drug
      concentration. Patients are with poor compliance, related adverse reaction and medical costs
      increase. At the same time, some patients appear neutropenia thought RhG-CSF is given.
      Therefore, how to reduce the frequency of RhG-CSF injections and more effectively prevent
      neutropenia more effectively, on the premise of ensure the safety of patients to achieve
      better effect of chemotherapy, has always been the focus of the clinical problem.

      Pegylated recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(PEG-rhG-CSF) is a first
      class national new drug developed by domestic pharmaceutical companies. According to some
      phase Ⅱand phase Ⅲ clinical trials, PEG-rhG-CSF has a good effect. The patients need only
      one injection for PEG-rhG-CSF each Cycle of chemotherapy, and the effect of rising white
      blood cell is more smoothly, and it can avoid pain of repeated injection of PEG-rhG-CSF
