      This study aimed to test the effects of a 12-month Healthy Beat Accupunch (HBA) exercise
      program on the perceived health status and sleep quality of the community-dwelling older
      adults.

      Phase I: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be used to test the effects of a
      six-month, instructor-led Healthy Beat Accupunch (HBA) exercise program on the perceived
      health status and sleep quality of the community-dwelling older adults. Through the use of
      convenience sampling strategy, eight community care stations with approximately 240 older
      adults in Kaohsiung will be recruited and randomly assigned based on their community care
      stations to a HBA experimental group or a wait-list control group. Participants in the
      experimental group will receive the HBA exercise program led by trained and certified
      instructors, three times per week, 40 minutes per practice for six months; participants in
      the wait-list control group will continue with their regular daily activities. One pre-test
      and two post-tests, three months apart, will be conducted. Phase II: Using the same method
      as in the phase I, participants from the phase I will continue practicing the HBA exercise
      program, but guided by a DVD, for another six months. The feasibility, compliance, and
      effectiveness of the DVD-led HBA exercise program on the community-dwelling older adults
      will be tested, and another two post-tests, three months apart, will be conducted on the
      same outcome measurements as in the phase I.

    <description>The HBA exercise program includes: 1) warm-up: 5 slow and gentle exercises to regulate qi, loosen up the body, and elevate the energy for a safe transition to the next phase, 2) accupunch: 14 low-to-medium speed exercises to punch the 14 meridians to enhance the cardiovascular-respiratory workout, and 3) relaxation: 5 low-speed, muscle relaxing exercises with deep breaths to sooth the body and mind. It is conducted 3 times per week and 40 minutes per practice.</description>
