    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Hybrid
      Closed Loop system (HCL) in adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in the home
      setting. A diverse population of patients with type 1 diabetes will be studied. The study
      population will have a large range for duration of diabetes and glycemic control, as
      measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C). They will be enrolled in the study regardless of
      their prior diabetes regimen, including using Multiple Daily Injections (MDI), Continuous
      Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) or Sensor-Augmented Pump therapy (SAP)

      This is a 6 month, multi-center, randomized, parallel, adaptive study in type 1 diabetes
      with a 6 month continuation period. The study will have three periods:

        1. Run-in Period: The run-in period can be up to 60 days during which time a blinded CGM
           sensor will be worn for two weeks.

        2. Study Period: There will be a 6 month randomized study period with two arms: The HCL
           system and Control.

        3. Continuation Period: There will be a 6 month continuation period during which time all
           subjects will use the HCL system with Auto Mode.

      Up to 1500 subjects will be enrolled in order to have 1000 subjects complete the study. Up
      to 70 investigational Centers in the US and Canada, as well as in the Medtronic EMEA region,
      that is comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, will be enrolled.
