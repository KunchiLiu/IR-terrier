    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-041. TAK-041 is being tested to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses of TAK-041
      in healthy participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants. The study is composed of 2 parts. Part
      1 (single-rising dose [SRD], alternating panel design) and Part 2 (multiple-rising dose
      [MRD], sequential panel design). Part 1 consists of 2 cohorts, participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two treatment sequences of 4 and 3 periods in cohorts 1 and 2
      respectively:

        -  TAK-041 5-400 mg

        -  Placebo (inactive)- this is a similar formulation that looks like the study drug but
           has no active ingredient.

      Part 2 consists of 3 cohorts, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      treatments. Dose levels and duration for Part 2 will be based on emerging
      safety/tolerability and PK data from Part 1.

        -  TAK-041

        -  Placebo This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants
           will remain confined to the study site from check-in (Day -1) through Days 5 of each
           period in part 1 and through Day 18 in Part 2. Participants will be contacted by
           telephone 14±2 days after the last dose of study drug for follow-up assessment.
