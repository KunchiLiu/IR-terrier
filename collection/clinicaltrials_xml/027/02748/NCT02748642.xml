  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, single and multiple
      ascending-dose study will be conducted in two parts to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of BITS7201A. Part A will be an ascending, single-dose,
      sequential-group study where participants will be randomly assigned to active drug or
      placebo. Part B will be an ascending, multiple-dose, sequential-group study where
      participants will be randomized to active drug or placebo. Total length of the study is
      anticipated to be approximately 12 months.
