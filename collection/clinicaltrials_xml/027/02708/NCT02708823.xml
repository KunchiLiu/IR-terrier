  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common complication after surgery is a temporary state of confusion called postoperative
      delirium (PD) affecting particularly elder patients. In 2014, a computer program for tablet
      computers named Delirium Risk Profile (DRP) was developed at the University Hospital Basel
      to assist preoperative screening. The aim of this study is to generate normative data with
      cognitively healthy participants for the DRP.

      A common complication after surgery is a temporary state of confusion called postoperative
      delirium (PD), affecting particularly elder patients. Prior studies found risk factors for
      PD, that are present preoperatively, e.g. older age, cognitive impairment, sensory
      impairment, surgical intervention-related factors, or the postoperative care. However, the
      preoperative risk of PD is not screened routinely as it is time-consuming and requires
      trained personnel.

      In 2014, the Delirium Risk Profile (DRP), a self-administered computer program for tablet
      computers, was developed at the University Hospital Basel to assist preoperative screening.
      It was tested in healthy and cognitively impaired volunteers, as well as in patients
      undergoing surgery. The aim of this study is to provide normative data for the computer
      program DRP, and to enable clinicians to administer the DRP as a routinely used tool in the
      Preoperative Evaluation Clinic.
