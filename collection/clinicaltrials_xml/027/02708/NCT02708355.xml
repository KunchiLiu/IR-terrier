    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the association between gastric acid
      suppression and relief of 24 hour heartburn following treatment with the proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) drug esomeprazole in frequent heartburn patients.

    <description>Boxplots of change in percentage (%) of time with intragastric Power of Hydration greater than 4 (pH&gt;4) will be plotted for subjects who obtained relief of 24 hour heartburn at Day 14 and subjects who did not obtain relief. A logistic regression will be performed with relief of 24 hour heartburn (yes/no) at Day 14 as the dependent variable and change in % of intragastric pH&gt;4 as the independent variable, controlling for age, sex and BMI.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed symptom history of heartburn, acid regurgitation, or epigastric pain of at
             least 3 months, while treating with gastric acid modulating therapy (antacids, H2
             receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and/or PPIs).

          -  Heartburn symptoms that average 3 times per week or greater including at least 2
             episodes of nighttime heartburn symptoms per week over the past 30 days.

          -  When heartburn medications were used, subject had heartburn symptoms that were
             responsive to antacids, non prescription H2RAs, or short term non prescription or
             prescription PPIs at approved doses but complete resolution of heartburn was not
             achieved.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history (past or present) of erosive esophagitis verified by endoscopy.

          -  The need for continuous treatment with H2RAs, PPIs, gastric prokinetic drugs, or
             antacids for any indication through the study (eg, long term prescription therapy).

          -  Subjects requiring continuous intervention by a physician for the treatment of GERD
             (ie, treatment of erosive esophagitis or prevention of relapse of healed
             esophagitis).
