  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of cancer detection when the
      MIRA technology is combined with mammography, in women above 30 years old who are undergoing
      screening mammography or are scheduled for image-guided needle biopsy due to lesions
      detected by other imaging modalities.

      The hypothesis is that breast cancer screening based on functional imaging will result in
      the early detection of breast cancers, at times predating mammographic conspicuity. In
      addition, breast cancer screening based on functional imaging will be unaffected by breast
      density. therefore, the combination of anatomic screening (mammography) and functional
      imaging based screening (MIRA) will result in significantly higher breast cancer detection
      rates in women with dense breast tissue by indicating the need for additional breast imaging
      technology, usually MRI.

             or

          2. Subjects scheduled for image guided needle biopsy as a result of findings obtained
             during standard of care imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasound and/or MRI)
             performed at the clinical site that participates in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Male by birth.

             procedure.

          5. Subjects who have had mammography, ultrasound or MRI examination performed on the day
             of the study prior to MIRA scan.
