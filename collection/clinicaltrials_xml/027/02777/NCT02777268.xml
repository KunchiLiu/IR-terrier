      This was a single centre, open-label, randomised, 5-way crossover study design to compare
      the PK of Infacort® versus immediate-release hydrocortisone tablets and to evaluate the dose
      proportionality of 0.5 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg Infacort®. The study was conducted in 1
      cohort of 16 healthy male subjects and comprised a Screening Visit, 5 treatment periods
      (Treatment Periods 1 to 5) and a Post-study Visit.

          -  Subjects with no clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry, haematology and
             urine examination values within 14 days prior to the first dose of investigational
             medicinal product (IMP).

          -  Subjects with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen determined within 14 days
             prior to the first dose of IMP. A positive alcohol test may have been repeated at the
             discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Subjects with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B surface
             antigen (Hep B) and hepatitis C virus antibody (Hep C) results.

          -  Subjects with no clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram
             (ECG) determined within 14 days prior to the first dose of IMP.

          -  Subjects with no clinically-significant deviation outside the normal ranges for blood
             pressure and pulse measurements.

          -  Subjects (unless anatomically sterile or where abstaining from sexual intercourse was
             in-line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) and sexual partners
             used effective contraception methods during the trial and for 3 months after the last
             dose of IMP, for example; oral contraceptive + condom, intra-uterine device (IUD) +
             condom or diaphragm with spermicide + condom.

          -  Subjects were available to complete the study.

             disorders/illnesses.

          -  A clinically significant history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Inability to communicate well with the Investigator (i.e., language problem, poor
             mental development or impaired cerebral function).

          -  Participated in a New Chemical Entity clinical study within the previous 4 months or
             a marketed drug clinical study within the previous 3 months. (N.B. The washout period
             between trials was defined as the period of time elapsed between the last dose of the
             previous study and the first dose of the next study).

          -  Subjects who had consumed more than 2 units of alcohol per day within 7 days prior to
             the first dose of IMP or had consumed any alcohol within the 48 hr period prior to
             the first dose of IMP.

          -  Donation of 450 mL or more of blood within the previous 3 months.

          -  Subjects who smoked (or ex-smokers who had smoked within 6 months prior to first dose
             of IMP).

          -  Subjects who worked shifts (i.e. regularly alternated between days, afternoons and
