      Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of testosterone enanthate (TE) following a single
      dose via QuickShot® Testosterone (QST) 50 mg, 75 mg, or 100 mg when administered by intended
      users in a usability study.

      Intended users are patients as well as patient caregivers, such as family members or friends
      who are able to assist the patient to administer the medication (i.e. lay users). One user
      group of approximately 15 patients will have their dose administered by a qualified
      healthcare professional (HCP).
