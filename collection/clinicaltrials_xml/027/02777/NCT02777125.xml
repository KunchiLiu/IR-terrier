  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is determines if metered dose inhalers are as effective as breath actuated
      nebulizers for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients
      presenting to the emergency department. Half of the participating patients received
      albuterol via the metered dose inhaler whereas the other half received albuterol via the
      breath actuated nebulizer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Albuterol administered via metered dose inhalers with spacers are more effective than small
      volume nebulizers in the treatment of acute pediatric asthma exacerbations. There is also
      supporting data that the breath actuated nebulizers are also more effective than small
      volume nebulizers. The effectiveness of breath actuated nebulization compared to MDI for
      treating asthma exacerbations is less well defined.

      This is the first prospective study demonstrating that metered dose inhalers are
      non-inferior to breath actuated nebulizers for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma
      exacerbations in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department.

      Metered dose inhalers with spacers are more readily available to the general population, are
      easily transportable and do not require a power source. Demonstrating equal effectiveness of
      albuterol delivery systems for treatment of acute pediatric asthma exacerbations would
      enable physicians to confidently utilize clinical encounters as opportunities to educate
      families on management of asthma exacerbations using their home appliance.

    <description>Albuterol administered via MDI and spacer device with weight and severity based dosing. For weight less than 20 kg: mild and moderate disease 540mcg of albuterol per dose. For weight greater than or equal to 20 kg: mild disease 540 mcg of albuterol per dose and moderate disease 1080 mcg of albuterol per dose.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects randomized to BAN were evaluated for proper breath actuation technique. For subjects unable to coordinate breath actuation, the RT attached an appropriately sized mask to the device, changed the setting to continuous nebulization and returned upon completion of the treatment. Albuterol dosing was based upon the subject's weight and presenting symptom severity. Children presenting in the mild and moderate severity category weighing less than 20kg, received 2500mcg of albuterol. Children weighing more than 20kg, received 2500mcg of albuterol if their presentation met mild severity criteria, or 5000mcg if they met moderate criteria.</description>

    <intervention_name>Metered Dose Inhaler</intervention_name>
    <description>A metered dose inhaler (MDI) is a small hand held pressurized canister device that contains both a medication, in this case albuterol, and a propellant. Pressing the device delivers 90mcg of albuterol. The MDI is attached to a spacer device, which is a one way holding chamber which allows the medication to be delivered over a series of breaths.</description>

    <intervention_name>Breath Actuated Nebulizer</intervention_name>
    <description>The breath actuated nebulizer (BAN) device is a device that converts liquid medication, in this case albuterol, into an aerosol. It consists of a mouthpiece, a medication reservoir, and connective tubing that attaches to a compressor. This BAN device delivers medication when the patient takes a breath, but it can be attached to a mask and set to continuous nebulization for patients that are not able to coordinate their breaths.</description>
