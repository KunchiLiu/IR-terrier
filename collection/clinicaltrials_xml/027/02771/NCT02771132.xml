  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of classroom-based
      behavioral interventions (12-hour girls program and 12-hour boys program), to a standard-of
      care intervention, on reducing the incidence of self-reported sexual assault among girls
      from baseline.

      Secondary objectives of this study is to determine the impact of the interventions on
      related physical and mental health status/outcomes, STI-risk behaviors, self-efficacy, and
      self-esteem.

    <textblock>
      In Kenya, up to 46% of women report childhood sexual assault. In an implementation research
      project, a team at Stanford University will be pairing with three Kenyan NGO's to research
      the effectiveness of an intervention to prevent sexual assault amoung adolescent girls in
      the informal settlements around Nairobi, Kenya. The study design will be a
      cluster-randomized controlled trial with two arms comparing the intervention to a standard
      of care group. The intervention consists of two side-by-side behavioral and skills-based
      interventions, one for girls and one for boys, taught in schools. The interventions include
      identifying and avoiding risky situations, verbal techniques to diffuse situations, as well
      as bystander intervention techniques for boys and self-defense techniques for girls.
      Settlements with schools participating in the project include Kibera, Dandora, Huruma, and
      Mukuru.

      This grant is part of the larger &quot;What Works to Prevent Violence: A global program to
      prevent violence against women and girls&quot; initiative, which is a large international
      initiative aimed at the prevention of gender-based violence. The initiative includes 18
      projects from around the globe, and is supported by the Medical Research Council of South
      Africa, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the UK Department for
      International Development (DFID). The primary contact people at Stanford University for this
      project are Clea Sarnquist, DrPH, MPH (cleas@stanford.edu) and Michael Baiocchi, PhD
      (baiocchi@stanford.edu).
