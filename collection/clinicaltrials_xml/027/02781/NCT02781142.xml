      Motor imagery training facilitates the neural plasticity with increasing the neuronal
      cortical pathways in the brain. Motor imagery training is an effective way in stroke
      survivors. However, its effects in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) are not known.
      Additionally, telerehabilitation based motor imagery training is very rare treatment way
      which requires more research. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of
      telerehabilitation based motor imagery training on gait and balance performance of the
      persons with MS.

      The participants will be allocated into three groups, including motor imagery training,
      wait-list control group, and age, gender, and education matched healthy control group. Each
      group will include at least 25 participants (i.e. in total 75 participants).

      All the assessments will be performed before and after the training in the 6-week motor
      imagery training group. The participants in the wait-list control group will underwent the
      assessment with a 6-week interval. The healthy participants will be assessed only one.

      The motor imagery training will be designed for the individual basis with following standard
      protocols. It will be applied three times a week for 6 weeks. The first three sessions will
      be performed in the clinic, the other will be performed at the patients' home with a
      telerehabilitation technique.

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, and demyelinating disease of the central
      nervous system. It is the most common neurological disease which causes progressive gait and
      balance disorders in young adults. The previous studies have indicated that home care and
      treatment services, which accelerates the healing process and makes the one feel better, are
      more preferred by the patients. Persons with MS are commonly not able to access the
      institutional rehabilitation services because of their disability and/or home location. It
      restricts the participation of the persons with MS and their treatment benefits. In recent
      years, the telerehabilitation programs are increasing to overcome this problem. Motor
      imagery training also stands as a good option in the rehabilitation programs. Motor imagery
      is a mental process by which an individual rehearses or simulates a given action. Motor
      imagery training facilitates the neural plasticity with increasing the neuronal cortical
      pathways in the brain. Motor imagery training is an effective way in stroke survivors.
      However, its effects in persons with MS are not known. Additionally, telerehabilitation
      based motor imagery training is very rare treatment way which requires more research.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of telerehabilitation based motor imagery
      training on gait and balance performance of the persons with MS.

      The participants will be allocated into three groups, including motor imagery training,
      wait-list control group, and age, gender, and education matched healthy control group. Each
      group will include at least 25 participants (i.e. in total 75 participants). The persons
      with MS will be recruited from the outpatient MS clinic of Dokuz Eylul University, and the
      healthy participants will be recruited from the stuff of Dokuz Eylul University.

      The inclusion and exclusion criteria assessments and the neurological examination will be
      performed by a blinded neurologist specialized in MS. The cognition, fatigue, depression,
      and quality of life assessment will be performed by a blinded neuropsychologist. The
      remaining assessments, including walking, balance, and motor imagery abilities will be
      assessed by a blinded physiotherapist. All the assessments will be performed before and
      after the training in the 6-week motor imagery training group. The participants in the
      wait-list control group will underwent the assessment with a 6-week interval. The healthy
      participants will be assessed only one.

      The motor imagery training will be designed for the individual basis with following standard
      protocols. It will be applied three times a week for 6 weeks. The first three sessions will
      be performed in the clinic, the other will be performed at the patients' home with a
      telerehabilitation technique.
