  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inherited retinal dystrophies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of
      conditions, which often present in childhood.Inherited retinal degenerations cause sight
      impairment in approximately 1 in 3000 people in the Western world. There are currently no
      effective treatments.

      Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a severe, early-onset form of inherited retinal
      degeneration involving both rod and cone photoreceptors. LCA is caused by mutations in one
      of at least 19 different genes.Mutations in RPE65, which is expressed in the retinal pigment
      epithelium (RPE), are responsible in 3 to 16 % of people affected. The RPE65 gene encodes a
      65-kDa retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-specific protein that is required for the conversion
      of vitamin A to 11-cis-retinal by the RPE and is essential for the regeneration of the rod
      visual pigment

      Proof of principle studies for RPE65 gene replacement therapy has been demonstrated with the
      use of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2/2) vectors in animal models.
      Furthermore clinical trials of gene replacement therapy in RPE65 associated LCA (RPE65-LCA)
      have shown significant promise. All three clinical trials showed improvement in visual
      function over the first year, however longer term follow up Proof of principle studies for
      RPE65 gene replacement therapy has been demonstrated with the use of recombinant
      adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2/2) vectors in animal models. Furthermore clinical
      trials of gene replacement therapy in RPE65 associated LCA (RPE65-LCA) have shown
      significant promise. All three clinical trials showed improvement in visual function over
      the first year, however longer term follow up demonstrated progressive visual loss and that
      initial improvements were not maintained.

      Greater efficacy was noted in animal models. The relatively lower efficacy of treatment in
      participants was most likely due to insufficient production of RPE65 protein from AAV2/2
      hRPE65 in the human eye.

      Having identified the maximal tolerated AAV2/2 vector dose in the previous clinical trial,
      an optimized therapeutic vector to drive more efficient transgene expression and increase
      the availability of RPE65 for affected humans has been developed.

      The aim of this trial is to determine the safety of the new optimised AAV2/5 vector in
      humans and to explore its potential efficacy.

      This trial will take place across 2 sites (Moorfields Eye Hospital in the UK and University
      of Michigan Kellogg Eye Centre in the US). Up to 27 patients will be recruited.

      The trial will involve a dose escalation phase, where up to 18 adult participants will be
      administered one of 3 different doses (low, intermediate or high) of using a 3+3 design.
      Dose escalation will be undertaken in adults, based on an escalation rule around
      dose-limiting events (DLEs).

      Up to 9 children aged 3 or above will then be included once an acceptable safety profile has
      been established in adults. Review of safety data will be undertaken by the IDMC prior to
      each dose escalation.

      The trial will involve 13 visits that occur during an approximate 9 to 12 month period.
      Delivery of the vector to the subretinal space will be performed following a standard
      surgical vitrectomy.

      Subjects will be asked to consider enrolling onto a separate long-term follow-up study that
      will continue to monitor the safety of the intervention after this study ends, for a period
      of 5 years.

      Assessments that will be undertaken depending on age, co-operation and ability to undertake
      the test include (see schedule of assessments):

        -  Medical history, ocular examination, visual acuity testing, contrast sensitivity,
           reading speed, colour fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence, SDOCT imaging,
           adaptive optics imaging, mesopic and scotopic microperimetry

        -  Electrophysiological assessments incorporating the protocols recommended by the
           International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV). Full-field
           electroretinogram (FFERG) - a measure of global retinal function - will not be
           undertaken if previously documented to be undetectable - the majority of patients will
           have undetectable FFERG. Pattern ERG (PERG) and multifocal ERG (mfERG) will be
           undertaken on an annual basis to determine change in central retinal function over time
           (often residual central function till late in disease) - but will not be repeated once
           found to be undetectable.

        -  Visual Field Testing. The Octopus 900 perimeter will be used. Static full-field testing
           will be undertaken employing the GATE strategy, and size V test targets. Further
           analysis will be undertaken to model the entire hill-of-vision which will enhance the
           information obtained with full-field static perimetry.

        -  Vision guided mobility. This will be assessed by measuring the ability of each subject
           to navigate a simple route in a range of controlled illuminances.

        -  QoL questionnaires (IVI_A, IVI_C and EQ5D-5L)

        -  Blood tests to confirm mutation within the RPE65 gene, bio distribution of the vector
           and evaluation of immune responses, biochemistry and haematology.
