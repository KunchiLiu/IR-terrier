  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a left ventricular rapid pacing using the
      valve delivery guide-wire in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) reduces the
      overall procedure duration in comparison with the conventional method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Use of temporary pacing via a right ventricular lead in TAVI is still mandatory to ensure
      transient cardiac standstill while predilatation is performed and the valve is being
      positioned and deployed. This requires an additional venous vascular access and a pacing
      catheter which are both likely to generate complications.

      This study compares the standard right ventricular rapid pacing to a new and simplified
      technique : a left ventricular rapid pacing is provided via the back-up 0.035 &quot; guidewire.
      The cathode of an external pacemaker is placed on the tip of the 0.035&quot; wire and the anode
      on a needle inserted into the groin. Insulation is ensured by the balloon or TAVI catheter.
