    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to characterize the effects of twice daily administration of
      rhPTH(1-84) on the way the body handles rhPTH(1-84) as well as its actions, and safety and
      tolerability over the course of 24-36 hours as compared with the current once daily dosing
      regimen of marketed rhPTH(1-84) (marketed in the United States as Natpara®).

          2. Requirement for supplemental oral calcium treatment ≥ 1000 mg per day.

          3. Requirement for active vitamin D therapy at a dose of ≥ 0.25 mcg per day . (i.e., ≥
             0.25 mcg calcitriol or equivalent per day).

          4. Serum calcium levels ≥7.0 to ≤9.5 mg/dL (1.75-2.375 mmol/L) based on local clinical
             chemistry lab results at Screening (central lab) and Treatment Period 1, Day -2
             (central and/or local lab).

          5. Urinary calcium excretion ≥250 mg (6.25mmol)/24h while on usual calcium and active
             vitamin D supplementation, based on historical (ie within 12 months) data provided by

             Investigator.

          9. Serum 25(OH) D level between the lower limit of normal and 1.5 fold the laboratory
             upper limit of normal at the first screening visit.

             hormone, digoxin; raloxifene or similar selective estrogen receptor modulators; and
             (5) 12 months: intravenous bisphosphonates, drug or alcohol abuse

             respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, immunologic, hematologic, endocrine (with
             exception of the condition under study), or neurologic system(s) or psychiatric
             disease as determined by the Investigator.

          4. Known history of hypoparathyroidism resulting from an activating mutation in the
             calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) gene or impaired responsiveness to PTH
             (pseudohypoparathyroidism).

          5. Any disease that might affect calcium metabolism or calcium-phosphate homeostasis
             other than hypoparathyroidism

          6. Subjects who are at increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma.

          7. Subjects who have a known history of hypocalcemia during initiation of treatment or
             following abrupt withdrawal of treatment with PTH, PTH analogues or fragments of PTH.

          8. Subjects dependent on regular paretneral calcium infusions to maintain calcium
             homeostasis within 3 months prior to enrollment.

          9. Any medical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would make the subject unsuitable for this study.
