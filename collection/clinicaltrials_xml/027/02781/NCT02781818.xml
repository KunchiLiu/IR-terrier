  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of intralesional triamcinolone for the treatment of
      hidradenitis suppurativa

      Participants: Patients diagnosed with Hidradenitis Suppurativa that have active inflammatory
      HS lesions. Up to 60 lesions will be treated. Between 20 and 60 patients will be enrolled
      dependent on the number of lesions they have treated. (up to 3 per patient)

      Procedures (methods): Injection of triamcinolone or placebo into active lesions of
      hidradenitis suppurativa

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of two concentrations of
      intralesional triamcinolone, triamcinolone 40mg/mL and triamcinolone 10mg/mL, with normal
      saline as a placebo control. For subjects with lesions deemed appropriate for the study,
      between one and three treatment sites will be marked with sequential lettering with a skin
      marker and documented by body location. Baseline pain level of each lesion will be recorded.
      At that time each lesion will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to be treated with
      intralesional triamcinolone 10mg/mL, triamcinolone 40mg/mL, or normal saline placebo.

      Following treatment, subjects will be given a paper questionnaire that will ask them to rate
      their level of pain on a 1-10 scale for each lesion, and whether they believe the target
      lesion has resolved on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. On day 14 they will also rate how
      helpful they think the treatment is on a scale of 0-4. These will be patient-reported
      outcomes only without any physician assessment as this is felt to be a more clinically
      relevant outcome.

      Aim 1. Characterize and compare the 3 regimens in terms of days to resolution of treated
      lesion.

      Hypotheses for Aim 1: Days to resolution of treated lesions will be fewer in the treatment
      groups compared to normal saline placebo, and will be fewer with triamcinolone 40mg/mL
      compared to triamcinolone 10mg/mL.

      Aim 2. Characterize and compare the 3 regimens in terms of pain level on day 5.

      Hypotheses for Aim 2: Rating of pain will be less in the treatment groups compared to normal
      saline placebo, and will be less with triamcinolone 40mg/mL compared to triamcinolone
      10mg/mL at day 5.

      Aim 3. Characterize and compare the 3 regimens in terms of patient rating of the &quot;benefit of
      the treatment Hypotheses for Aim 1: Patient rating will be more favorable the treatment
      groups compared to normal saline placebo, and will be more favorable with triamcinolone
      40mg/mL compared to triamcinolone 10mg/mL.

    <description>Triamcinolone acetonide is a glucocorticoid used in intralesional treatment of many skin diseases, intra-articular treatment of inflammatory joint diseases, and intramuscular treatment for systemic management of systemic inflammatory diseases. It is commonly used in clinical practice for the treatment of acute abscesses and nodules of hidradenitis suppurativa, but little clinical trial data exist supporting its use.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and females &gt; or = 16 years of age

          2. Diagnosis or history of clinical features consistent with hidradenitis suppurativa
             for &gt;1 year

          3. Patient must have an inflammatory lesion at the time of treatment. This can be an
             inflammatory nodule defined by a tender, palpable subcutaneous nodule, or an abscess
             defined as as fluctuant, painful, subcutaneous nodule. Lesions greater than 2
             centimeters in size will not be excluded. Inflammatory nodules or abscesses can be
             treated if they are associated with a sinus tract, which is a chronic HS lesion
             defined by tunneled lesion with multiple openings to the surface of the skin. Sinus
             tracts without associated nodules or abscesses will not be treatment targets.

          4. Patient must be off of antibiotics or on a stable course of oral antibiotics for &gt;4
             weeks prior to the baseline visit. Allowable antibiotics during treatment course are
             topical clindamycin, topical chlorhexidine gluconate, oral doxycycline, oral
             minocycline, or oral clindamycin +/- rifampin.

          5. Must be able to provide adequate informed consent for themselves

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any patient with signs of active infection at the time of screening that is not
             related to their hidradenitis suppurativa

          2. Patients who have been on non-permitted antibiotics in the 4 weeks prior to baseline.
             Allowable antibiotics during treatment course are topical clindamycin, topical
             chlorhexidine gluconate, oral doxycycline, oral minocycline, or oral clindamycin +/-
             rifampin.

          3. Patients who have had surgical intervention of the treated body region (i.e., right
             axilla) beyond incision and drainage procedures in the last 8 weeks or with open
             surgical wounds in the treatment region.

          4. Patients who have been started on immunomodulatory or biologic treatment (i.e.,
             adalimumab, infliximab) in the past 4 weeks

          5. Patients on non-stable doses of opiate analgesics for the last 14 days prior to
             screening

          6. Patients with history of hypersensitivity reactions to triamcinolone

          7. Ongoing health or physical exam concerns which the investigator feels may put the
             patient at significant risk
