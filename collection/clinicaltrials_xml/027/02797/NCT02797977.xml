  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CCT245737 is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It blocks a chemical messenger
      (enzyme) called checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK-1) which is part of the signaling process within
      cells which can make cells produce chemicals that trigger and control cell growth and cell
      death. Chemotherapy agents are used to try to kill cancer cells however sometimes cancer
      cells can repair themselves using these signaling processes and continue to grow. It is
      thought that CCT245737 may help chemotherapy to work better by preventing cancer cells from
      repairing themselves, when they have been damaged by the chemotherapy, so that more cancer
      cells will be killed.

      There are 2 stages to this study:

        1. Patients in Stage 1 will be given CCT245737 to take in addition to receiving treatment
           with gemcitabine and cisplatin.

        2. Patients in Stage 2 will be given CCT245737 to take in addition to receiving treatment
           with gemcitabine only.

      The main aims of the study are to find the maximum dose of CCT245737 that can be given
      safely to patients with gemcitabine and cisplatin or gemcitabine alone, more about the
      potential side effects of the drugs and how they can be managed and what happens to the
      combination of drugs inside the body.

      Each stage of the study is split into two parts: Part one will be a 'dose escalation' phase
      where cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will receive increasing doses of CCT245737 until the
      recommended Phase II dose is established. Part two will be an 'expansion phase' where a
      larger group of patients will be treated at the recommended Phase II dose to find out more
      about how the drug is working. In the Stage 1 dose expansion part, patients with either
      solid tumours amenable to biopsy or non-small cell lung cancer will be recruited. In the
      Stage 2 dose expansion part patients with either solid tumours amenable to biopsy or
      pancreatic cancer will be recruited.

             However, those patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before
             enrolment and agree to use two forms of contraception (one highly effective form plus
             a barrier method) [oral; injected or implanted hormonal contraception and condom;
             intra-uterine device and condom; diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condom] or to
             sexual abstinence, effective from the first administration of CCT245737, throughout
             the trial and for six months afterwards are considered eligible.

          9. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take
             measures not to father children by using a barrier method of contraception [condom
             plus spermicide] or to sexual abstinence, effective from the first administration of
             CCT245737, throughout the trial and for six months afterwards. Men with partners of
             child-bearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner uses an
             effective method of contraception for the same duration for example, hormonal
             contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel or sexual
             abstinence). Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier
             method contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure
             to the foetus or neonate.

         10. Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.

         11. At high medical risk because of non-malignant systemic disease including active
             uncontrolled infection.

         12. Known to be serologically positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human
             immunodeficiency virus.

         13. Concurrent congestive heart failure, prior history of class III/ IV cardiac disease
             (New York Heart Association [NYHA] - refer to Appendix 3), prior history of cardiac
             ischaemia or prior history of cardiac arrhythmia

         14. Prior bone marrow transplant or have had extensive radiotherapy to greater than 25%
             of bone marrow within eight weeks.

         15. Peanut allergy

         16. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study of CCT245737. Participation in an
             observational trial or interventional clinical trial which does not involve
             administration of an IMP and which would not place an unacceptable burden on the
             patient in the opinion of the Investigator and Medical Advisor would be acceptable.

         17. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.
