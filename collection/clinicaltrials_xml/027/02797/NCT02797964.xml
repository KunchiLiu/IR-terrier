  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of this clinical study are to find out the maximum dose of CCT245737 that can
      be given safely to patients, more about the potential side effects of the drug and how they
      can be managed and what happens to CCT245737 inside the body.

      CCT245737 is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It blocks a chemical messenger
      (enzyme) called checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK-1) which is part of the signaling process within
      cells. This can make cells produce chemicals that trigger and control cell growth and cell
      death. In some types of cancer these chemical messengers are 'switched on' or 'switched off'
      allowing the cancer cells to keep growing and to grow more quickly than normal cells. Kinase
      inhibitors are a new type of drug being used to try to stop the growth of cancers and to
      kill cancer cells

      The study will follow a dose escalation design, initially with single patient cohorts until
      Grade 2 toxicity is observed, cohorts will then be expanded to 3-6 patients following a
      rolling six design until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Six further patients with
      disease amenable to biopsy will then be treated at this dose level or below in order to
      establish the recommenced Phase II dose for further evaluation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written (signed and dated) informed consent and be capable of co-operating with
             treatment and follow-up.

          2. Histologically or cytologically proven solid tumour, refractory to conventional
             treatment, or for which no conventional therapy is considered appropriate by the

          3. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          4. World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0-1 (Appendix 1).

             measurements must be performed within one week before the patient receives their
             first dose of IMP

               -  Laboratory Test Value required

               -  Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 90 g/L

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

               -  Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless raised due to tumour in which case
                  up to 5 x ULN is permissible

               -  Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          6. At least 18 years old at the time consent is given.

          7. Expansion Cohort at MTD: Patients must give consent for and have disease amenable to
             paired biopsies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Radiotherapy within the last six weeks (except for symptom control and where the
             lesions will not be used as measurable disease) and endocrine therapy except for
             luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists for prostate cancer, or, for
             all patients, chemotherapy during the previous four weeks, immunotherapy during the
             previous six weeks, nitrosoureas or Mitomycin-C during the previous six weeks or
             other investigational medicinal products (IMPs) during the four weeks before
             treatment.

          2. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments greater than CTCAE Grade 1.
             Exceptions to this are alopecia or certain toxicities, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator and the Medical Advisor should not exclude the patient.

          3. New or progressing brain metastases. Patients with brain metastases that have been
             radiologically stable over an 8 week period may be included.

          4. Female patients who are able to become pregnant (or are already pregnant or
             lactating). However, those patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             before enrolment and agree to use two forms of contraception (one highly effective
             form plus a barrier method) [oral; injected or implanted hormonal contraception and
             condom; intra-uterine device and condom; diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condom]
             or agree to sexual abstinence, effective from the first administration of CCT245737,
             throughout the trial and for six months afterwards are considered eligible.

          5. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take
             measures not to father children by using a barrier method of contraception [condom
             plus spermicide] or to sexual abstinence effective from the first administration of
             CCT245737, throughout the trial and for six months afterwards. Men with partners of
             child-bearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner uses an
             effective method of contraception for the same duration for example, hormonal
             contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel or sexual
             abstinence).

             Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier method
             contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure of the
             foetus or neonate.

          6. Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.

          7. At high medical risk because of non-malignant systemic disease including active
             uncontrolled infection.

             (New York Heart Association [NYHA] - refer to Appendix 3), prior history of cardiac
             ischaemia or prior history of cardiac arrhythmia.

         10. Prior bone marrow transplant or have had extensive radiotherapy to greater than 25%
             of bone marrow within 8 weeks.

         11. Patients that have previously had other myelosuppressive drugs such as mitomycin C
             within the last 6 weeks.

         12. Peanut allergy.

         13. QTc &gt; 450 msec in adult males and &gt; 470msec in adult females.

         14. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study of CCT245737. Participation in an
             observational trial or interventional clinical trial which does not involve
             administration of an IMP and which would not place an unacceptable burden on the
             patient in the opinion of the Investigator and Medical Advisor would be acceptable.

         15. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.
