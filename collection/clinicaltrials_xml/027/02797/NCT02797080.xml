      The purpose of this long term extension study is to evaluate the long-term safety of
      ACTIMMUNE® (interferon-γ 1b) in participants with Friedreich's Ataxia (FA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, long-term safety extension study of ACTIMMUNE® in the
      treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) in children and young adults. Participants who
      complete 26 weeks of treatment and the Week 28 Follow-Up Visit in HZNP-ACT-302 (NCT02593773)
      will be eligible to enter this long-term safety extension protocol. The Day 1 Visit of this
      study (HZNP-ACT-303) occurs on the same day as the Week 28 Follow-Up Visit for HZNP-ACT-302
      (NCT02593773). Participants will be required to return for clinic visits at least every six
      months. The treatment duration is open-ended, and treatment will continue until ACTIMMUNE®
      is commercially available for the treatment of FA in the United States or until the Sponsor
      decides not to continue development for the treatment of FA.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an investigational product, whether or not the event is considered related to the investigational product. An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the investigational product.</description>

    <description>ACTIMMUNE® will be administered three times per week by subcutaneous injection. The initial dose will be individualized for each participant and will be determined by the investigator, provided that the initial dose does not exceed the maximum tolerated dose in HZNP-ACT-302 (NCT02593773). The investigator may subsequently adjust the dose for any participant if deemed clinically appropriate, provided that the dose does not exceed 100 μg/m2.</description>
