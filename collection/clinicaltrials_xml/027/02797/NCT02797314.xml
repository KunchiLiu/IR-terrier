  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes have many complications in different organs. These
      complications are extremely frequent and severe: cardiovascular and renal disease, visual
      impairment, and, more recently, complications affecting bone such as fractures. Conventional
      methods for the evaluation of fracture risk are based on the Bone Mineral Density (BMD) or
      FRAX (algorithm for the prediction of osteoporotic fracture risk) are not sufficient in the
      context of diabetes. Several metaanalyses have shown that, paradoxically, a higher BMD in
      patients with type 2 diabetes compared to patients not suffering from this disease,
      independently of body mass index (BMI). The paradoxal increase in fracture risk, despite a
      high BMD has led to the hypothesis that diabetes induces a modification of the quality and
      not the quantity of bone. However, there is a lack of data as to bone quality in patients
      with type 2 diabetes as studies of bone biopsies from patients with type 2 diabetes are
      extremely rare.

      The objective of the study is to compare bone quality in patients with type 2 diabetes to
      that in patients who do not suffer from type 2 diabetes: evaluation of vertebral fractures
      by osteodensitometry, measurement of Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), and analysis of bone
      quality in biopsies (advanced glycation end products (AGE), contents of bone matrix and
      analysis of mineralization).

      The results will then be correlated with blood/urinary markers with the objective to
      determine one/several non-invasive biomarkers for bone status in diabetic patients.
