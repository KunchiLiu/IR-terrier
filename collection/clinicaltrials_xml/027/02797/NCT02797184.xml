    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to do the work that is necessary and sufficient for setting up
      an appropriate multi-center, randomized clinical trial (RCT) of a new therapy for heart
      failure: inorganic nitrate. The investigators will first determine the effects and
      palatability of ~12.8mmol KNO3 (an oral pill) as compared to the roughly equivalent amount
      of nitrate in 2 beetroot juice (BRJ) Sports Shots (by James White Drinks). Next, the
      investigators will determine the effects of inorganic nitrate (KNO3 in an oral pill format)
      on blood pressure, blood nitrate levels, breath nitric oxide (NO) levels, and exercise
      performance in a dose-response study. Third, the investigators will perform a small phase II
      chronic treatment study that will allow them to determine the best primary endpoint and the
      numbers of patients the investigators will need to study in the large, multi-center RCT to
      follow this project. In the small study and in the RCT to follow, the investigators will
      determine whether inorganic nitrate can improve aerobic exercise capacity, muscle power, and
      speed of muscle contraction, and lessen the effort of breathing during exercise.

      For all substudies:

      A) All Subjects will be consented.

      B) All Subjects will give permission for the investigators to review their medical records.

      C) For all studies, Subjects will be patients with HF.

      I. For the beetroot juice (BRJ) vs. KNO3 study:

        1. After consenting to participate, subjects will be instructed to refrain from spitting
           or the use of an antibacterial mouthwash, antacids, proton pump inhibitors, or chewing
           gum during the study.

        2. Subjects will be asked to answer questionnaires regarding their medical health (basic
           health questionnaire, Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire, a combined
           fatigue questionnaire.

      2a) Subjects will be asked to undergo a physical examination.

      3) Subjects will be interviewed by a dietician with regards to their typical dietary intake
      and instructed on a low nitrate diet.

      4) In study visit #1 subjects will be randomized to receive either two &quot;shots&quot; of BRJ (James
      White Drinks) or KNO3 in capsule form, both providing 12.8 mmol of NO3-.

      5) Before and at 3 time points after receiving the BRJ or placebo, subjects will undergo
      phlebotomy for plasma nutrient/hormone levels and will have their blood pressure checked and
      will blow into a tube connected to a small machine that will measure the amount of nitric
      oxide in their breath.

      6) Subjects will undergo transthoracic echocardiographic imaging at rest.

      7) Subjects will be asked to complete a palatability questionnaire.

      8) Subjects will be asked to undergo a mouth swab for bacterial DNA analyses.

      9) Subjects will undergo a 7 d washout period.

      10) Subjects will come in for study day 2 in which they will receive whichever treatment
      (BRJ or KNO3) they did not receive at first and then repeat the studies listed above in 1),
      5) and 7).

      II. For the KNO3 dose-response study:

        1. After consenting to participate, subjects will be instructed to refrain from spitting
           or the use of an antibacterial mouthwash, antacids, proton pump inhibitors, or chewing
           gum during the study.

        2. Subjects will be asked to answer questionnaires regarding their medical health (basic
           health questionnaire, Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire, a combined
           fatigue questionnaire) .

      2a) Subjects will be asked to undergo a physical examination.

      3) Subjects will be interviewed by a dietitian with regards to their typical dietary intake
      and instructed on a low nitrate diet.

      4) Subjects will undergo transthoracic echocardiographic imaging at rest.

      5) In study visit #1 subjects will be randomized to receive either 0, 10, or 20 mmol of NO3-
      in the form of KNO3.

      6) Before and at 3 time points after receiving the KNO3, subjects will undergo phlebotomy
      for plasma NO3- and NO2- levels and will have their blood pressure checked and will blow
      into a tube connected to a small machine that will measure the amount of NO in their breath.

      7) ~2 h after ingestion, subjects will undergo a 6 min walk test and a short physical
      performance battery test;

      8) Then subjects will swish, but not swallow a ~ 4 TBSP dilute solution of 10 mg-N/L
      nitrate. After 5 min subjects will spit it out into a container for measurement.

      9) Subjects will undergo a test of neuromuscular function using an isokinetic dynamometer (a
      device that measures voluntary muscle force production while controlling the speed of
      movement) and a device that measures grip strength.

      10) Subjects will perform a cycle ergometer test to determine their VO2peak. Subjects will
      have their blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm monitored during this study.

      11) Subjects will be asked to undergo a mouth swab for bacterial DNA analyses.

      12) Subjects will undergo a 7 d washout period.

      13) Subjects will come in for study day 2 in which they will receive whichever treatment (0,
      10, 20 mmol of NO3-) they did not receive at first and then repeat the studies listed above:
      1), 2), 3), 6), 7), 9), and 10).

      14) Subjects will undergo a 7 d washout period.

      15) Subjects will come in for study day 3 in which they will receive whichever treatment (0,
      10, 20 mmol of NO3-) they did not receive on their first or second study day and then repeat
      the studies listed above: 1), 2), 3), 5), 6), 7), 9), and 10).

      III. For the chronic KNO3 study:

        1. Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo or KNO3.

        2. Subjects will be asked to undergo the same steps 1-11) listed in the dose response
           study above after ingesting either KNO3 or placebo, ingest KNO3 or placebo for at least
           2 weeks, then undergo the steps 1), 2), 3), 6), 7), 8), and 9) again. The exercise
           studies will be done ~ 2 h after ingestion of KNO3 that day.
