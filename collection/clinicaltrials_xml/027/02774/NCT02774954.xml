      The study will test the efficacy of a hour long, one-on-one, active listening counseling
      session (called Change the Cycle or CTC) aimed at reducing behaviors among active people who
      inject drugs (PWID) that research has found to facilitate uptake of injection drug use among
      non-injectors. The study will involve ~1,100 PWID who will be randomized to CTC or an equal
      attention control intervention on improving nutrition. Participants will be recruited in Los
      Angeles and San Francisco, California and followed up at 6 and 12 months to determine
      changes in direct and indirect facilitation of injection initiation among non-injectors.

    <textblock>
      Our goal is to conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the &quot;Change the
      Cycle&quot; (CTC) intervention. CTC is an hour long, single-session, one-on-one intervention that
      aims to reduce injection initiation by encouraging active PWID to not promote drug
      injection, model injection behavior, describe how to inject, or assist in injection
      initiations of non-injectors. CTC uses the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills (IMB)
      model to achieve changes among active PWID through seven short modules. Information and
      motivational domains are addressed in guided conversations about (1) their own first
      injection episode and consequences, (2) past experiences initiating injection-naive people
      and consequences, (3) health, legal, and social risks related to injection drugs, (4)
      health, legal, social risks of initiating people, and (5) identifying their own behaviors
      that might promote injection among others. The behavioral skills are addressed through (6)
      skill-building discussions and consideration of common initiation scenarios, and (7) safer
      injection education.

      Aim 1: To test the efficacy of CTC on reducing the number of non-injectors initiated into
      injection (counts) by PWID. Hypothesis 1: PWID who receive CTC will report initiating fewer
      non-injectors into drug injection at 6 and 12 months as compared with PWID in the control
      condition.

      Aim 2: To test the efficacy of CTC on reducing the number of times PWID are asked to
      initiate (counts) someone into injection. Hypothesis 2: PWID who receive CTC will report
      having been asked fewer times to initiate someone into drug injection at 6 and 12 months as
      compared with PWID in the control condition.

      Aim 3: To test whether injection initiation social learning risks (injecting in front of,
      describing injection to, and speaking positively about injection to non-injectors) act as
      mediational mechanisms for the efficacy of the CTC intervention on initiation and
      request-to-initiate outcomes. Hypothesis 3: Social learning variables will significantly
      mediate the association between the CTC intervention and episodes of initiating and being
      requested to initiate someone into drug injection at 6 and 12 months.

      To achieve these aims, active PWID (N=1,076) will be randomly assigned to receive CTC or an
      equal attention control condition in Los Angeles (LA) and San Francisco (SF), CA. Injection
      initiation and injection initiation social learning variables will be collected at baseline,
      6 months, and 12 months using computer-assisted personal-interviewing (CAPI). The equal
      attention control condition will focus on improving nutrition, specifically increasing fresh
      water intake and protein consumption, and will replicate CTC in length, theoretical
      foundation (IMB), and modality (1 on 1 personal session).

      Changes from the proposed: We have made 3 modest changes in study procedures. 1) We will now
      include all active PWID over the age of 17 in the study. We had originally proposed to
      exclude subjects who did not report an injection initiation risk behaviors (e.g., describing
      injection, speaking positively about injection, or injecting in front of non-injectors) or
      injection initiation assistance in the last 6 months. However, the consistency of these
      behaviors is unknown and PWID who previously did not report these behaviors may initiate
      them. For instance, in Strike et al., 2014, 16% of PWID injected in front of non-injectors
      at follow-up interview, but not baseline. Excluding participants with no baseline injection
      initiation risk may result in missing important intervention effects (i.e., we expect
      control condition participants to have higher incidence/uptake of injection initiation risk
      as compared to experimental condition participants) and is how it would be implemented in
      community settings. This will change the overall number of PWID screened from an estimated
      1,700 to ~1,100. The reduction in overall participants allows us to make change number 2. 2)
      We are using CAPI rather than audio-computer assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). While ACASI
      has well documented advantages, we think the complexity of the behaviors we are exploring
      will require clarification which cannot easily be provided via self-interview even with the
      audio component. Cost savings from reducing the number of screened participants will allow
      us to hire interviewers to conduct the surveys. And 3) we originally proposed to have an
      equal attention control condition focused on sex risk reduction. However, in our last study
      of PWID in Los Angeles and San Francisco, we found that 30% of participants had no sexual
      contact in the last 6 months and 34% had only one partner suggesting that sex risk reduction
      maybe of limited interest and relevance to PWID in our samples. Instead, we will focus on
      improving nutrition in the equal attention control. Based on our prior study (Schmitz et
      al., 2016), we found that food insecurity was high among PWID (57% of PWID have low or very
      low food insecurity). Our participants are very low income (81% report monthly income of
      less than $1,351) and largely homeless (62%); focusing on strategies for improving eating
      behaviors seems highly appropriate for this population, yet have rarely been explored.

    <description>The nutrition equal attention control intervention is a single-session, 60- minute Information-Motivation-Behavioral (IMB) skills-based intervention addressing healthy eating. The healthy eating intervention uses a one-on-one guided conversation between the interventionist and the participant. The intervention addresses (1) information about current eating patterns and recommendations for healthy alternatives (20 minutes), (2) motivations for improving healthy eating by providing feedback to participants on personal responsibility, a menu of alternative change options, a decision balance exercise, and eating goal setting (10 minutes), and (3) Behavioral Self-Management Component (30 minutes) that covers eating scenarios, participant responses, and healthy alternatives to the scenario and the participants feedback.</description>

    <ipd_description>Using the National Addiction and HIV Data Archive program (NAHDAP), we will provide our datasets and codebooks to researchers in a format that facilitates data-sharing. After the completion of the study, the dataset will be de-identified and made available for secondary analysis on the NAHDAP website (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/). Researchers who request access will be given a password to access the data, documentation, and surveys. As part of the registration process, researchers will sign an agreement to adhere to the data coding guidelines that were developed for the project, will state their intentions for use, and will agree to inform the original investigators of their findings and publications for tracking purposes with acknowledgments to the granting agency. Because the respondents will be identified only by ID codes in the datasets, it will be impossible to identify individuals from the datasets.</ipd_description>
