      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether a medication called pioglitazone
      (trade name Actos) can reduce behavioral problems associated with cocaine use, improve brain
      structural changes associated with cocaine use and reduce cocaine craving and drug use in
      cocaine dependent patients.
