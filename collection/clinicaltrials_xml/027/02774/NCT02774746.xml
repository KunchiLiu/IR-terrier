    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that delivery at 36 0/7- 36 6/7
      weeks in stable patients with gastroschisis is superior to observation and expectant
      management. To test this hypothesis, we will complete a randomized, prospective,
      multi-institutional trial across North American Fetal Therapy Network-affiliated
      institutions. Patients may be enrolled in the study any time prior to 34 weeks, but will be
      randomized at 34 weeks to delivery at 36 weeks or observation. The primary composite
      outcomes will include stillbirth, neonatal death prior to discharge, respiratory morbidity,
      and need for parenteral nutrition at 30 days.

    <textblock>
      Gastroschisis is the most common congenital abdominal wall abnormality in which the
      intestines are herniated through the defect into the amniotic fluid. This is diagnosed by
      prenatal ultrasound at 18-20 weeks gestation. Gastroschisis occurs in 1 out of every 4000
      births and the incidence is increasing. The majority of patients with gastroschisis have an
      uncomplicated neonatal course and recover well after surgical repair. However, subsets of
      gastroschisis patients have more complicated courses due to loss of intestine or atresias.
      This may be due to exposure of the herniated intestines to the caustic effects of amniotic
      fluid or the narrowing of the abdominal wall defect over time causing constriction of the
      intestinal blood supply. Additionally, gastroschisis patients have an increased risk of
      in-utero fetal demise.

      The potential risk of pregnancy loss late in the third trimester has prompted some providers
      to deliver gastroschisis patients prior to term. This results in additional
      prematurity-related morbidity. There is no consensus about the ideal time to deliver a baby
      with gastroschisis and practice patterns vary widely.

      Retrospective data published show inconsistent results on outcomes with early delivery or
      later gestational age delivery in gastroschisis. There has been one randomized, prospective
      trial with delivery at 36 weeks versus awaiting spontaneous labor. This included 42 patients
      rendering the study largely underpowered. There was a trend towards decreased length of
      hospital stay and earlier time to full enteral feeding in the 36 week delivery group, but
      this did not reach statistical significance.

      As the current available literature does not adequately answer the question of optimal
      gestational age of delivery in patients with gastroschisis, the objective of this study is
      to investigate the hypothesis that delivery at 36 0/7- 36 6/7 weeks in stable patients with
      gastroschisis is superior to observation and expectant management. To test this hypothesis,
      we will complete a randomized, prospective, multi-institutional trial. Patients may be
      enrolled in the study any time prior to 34 weeks, but will be randomized at 34 weeks to
      delivery at 36 weeks or observation. The primary composite outcomes will include stillbirth,
      neonatal death prior to discharge, respiratory morbidity, and need for enteral nutrition at
      30days. Secondary maternal outcomes include need and indication for cesarean section,
      whether the patient required induction of labor or had spontaneous labor, and values of
      antenatal testing including amniotic fluid index (AFI), bowel diameter, and estimated fetal
      weight. Secondary neonatal outcomes include differences in birth weight, need for
      respiratory support independent of the operating room, gastroschisis bowel prognostic score,
      intestinal atresia, necrotizing enterocolitis, central venous catheter days, length of
      respiratory support, need for caffeine, bacteremia, discharge weight, and length of stay.

          -  Subjects must (1) speak English or French, (2) be ≥18 years old, (3) have a
             sonographic diagnosis of gastroschisis ≤34 weeks gestation, (4) have a singleton
             pregnancy, and (5) provide written informed consent for study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             chromosomal abnormality or another congenital structural abnormality, (2) severe
             intrauterine growth retardation, (3) a maternal history of previous stillbirth or
