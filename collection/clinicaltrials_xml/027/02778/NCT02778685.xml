      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works when given together with letrozole
      and palbociclib in patients with stage IV estrogen receptor positive breast cancer with
      stable disease that has not responded to letrozole and palbociclib. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as
      letrozole, may lessen the amount of estrogen made by the body. Palbociclib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      pembrolizumab, letrozole, and palbociclib may be an effective treatment for patients with
      stage IV estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), based on Response Evaluation Criteria In
      Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.1), of pembrolizumab in combination with letrozole and
      palbociclib in patients with metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)+human epidermal growth factor
      receptor (HER)2- breast cancer, and determine if the addition of pembrolizumab in patients
      with stable disease (SD) on letrozole and palbociclib can achieve a response (complete
      response [CR], partial response [PR], and ORR) measured from the study baseline, based on
      RECIST version 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of adding pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks)
      to ongoing treatment with letrozole (2.5 mg) and palbociclib (3 weeks on, one week off: dose
      of palbociclib can vary secondary to individual patient tolerance, range 75-125 mg) in
      patients with metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer.

      II. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). III. To evaluate overall survival (OS). IV.
      To evaluate duration of response (DOR) using RECIST version 1.1. V. To evaluate clinical
      benefit rate (CBR) using RECIST version 1.1. VI. To evaluate toxicities (using the National
      Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for adverse Events [CTCAE], version 4.0)
      associated with the triple drug combination (pembrolizumab, letrozole, and palbociclib) in
      patients with metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer.

      VII. To evaluate CR, PR, ORR, PFS, DOR, and CBR using immune-related Response Criteria In
      Solid Tumors (irRECIST); time to treatment failure will also be assessed.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study cellular/humoral immune response by analyzing immune and stromal cell
      characteristics before and after treatment that correlate with clinical response; this
      includes programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels.

      II. To study the peripheral serum thymidine kinase (TK) level and its association with
      treatment response.

      III. To study circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) and the effect of
      combining pembrolizumab, letrozole, and palbociclib on ctDNA profiles.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and palbociclib PO QD
      for 3 weeks. Courses with letrozole and palbociclib repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses with pembrolizumab repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 months for
      3 years, and then every 12 months for 1 year.
