    <textblock>
      This trial will compare the efficacy of three different patterns of twice-daily rTMS in
      major depression: rTMS delivered at 0 min vs. 30 min vs. 60 min intervals. The trial will
      include structural and functional MRI, EEG, and behavioral measures obtained before, during,
      and after treatment.
