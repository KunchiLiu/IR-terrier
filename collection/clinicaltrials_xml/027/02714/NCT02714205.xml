    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of uninterrupted transdermal nitrate
      therapy in 140 peri- or postmenopausal women who have frequent hot flashes. Women will be
      randomly assigned to uninterrupted use of transdermal nitrate therapy (participant directed
      dose-escalation of 0.2 to 0.6 mg/hr) or identical-appearing placebo patches for 12 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women aged 40 to 62 years (consistent with the recent MSFlash hot flash network
             trials, and likely to maximize enrollment of highly symptomatic women)

          -  Postmenopausal or in the late menopausal transition. For this study, postmenopausal
             status will be defined by: 1) self-reported history of bilateral oophorectomy, 2)
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 20 mU/mL for those with a self-reported
             history of hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy, or 3) no self-reported
             history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy, but absence of menses in the past 12 months.
             Late menopausal transition will be defined by amenorrhea for at least 60 days in the
             past 12 months within the specified age group.

          -  Documentation of an average of 7 or more hot flashes per 24 hours as well as 4 or
             more moderate-to-severe hot flashes per 24 hours as recorded on a validated 7-day
             screening symptom diary

          -  Willing to refrain from initiating other treatments that are known to affect the
             frequency of severity hot flashes during the trial period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or recent use of NTG or other nitrate-containing medications (i.e., use
             within 1 month of screening), or intention to use nitrate-containing medication
             during the interventional period

          -  Current or recent use of medications already known to reduce the frequency or
             severity of hot flashes (e.g., systemic estrogens or progestins in the past 3 months;
             clonidine, methyldopa, gabapentin, and selective serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake
             inhibitors (SSRIs/SNRIs) in the past 1 month); or intention to use these medications
             during the interventional period

          -  Current or recent use of phosphodiesterase inhibitor medications (within 1 month of
             screening), or intention to use these medications during the interventional period

          -  Self-reported history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic valve
             stenosis, or mitral valve stenosis (as conventional contraindications to NTG therapy)

          -  Self-reported history of coronary disease (since patients with coronary disease may
             need NTG therapy for chest pain or may be at increased risk of new coronary events in
             the setting of nitrate tolerance)

          -  Self-reported history of diabetes or 2 or more major risk factors for coronary
             disease (i.e., smoking, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia with physician-recommended
             pharmacologic treatment)

          -  Hypotension based on measured blood pressure &lt;90/60 at baseline; or uncontrolled
             hypertension based on measured blood pressure &gt; 180/110 at baseline

          -  Self-reported migraine or other headaches requiring pharmacologic treatment on a
             monthly or more frequent basis (since these may be worsened by NTG therapy)

          -  Known skin sensitivity to adhesives (which may generalize to the NTG patches)

          -  Unable to complete a brief 3-day run-in period involving the lowest available dose of
             NTG (0.1 mg/hr)

          -  Currently pregnant, gave birth within the past 3 months, or planning pregnancy during
             the study period

          -  Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent, fill out questionnaires, or complete
             study visits in English

          -  Report other conditions that, in the judgment of the investigators, render potential
             participants highly unlikely to follow the protocol, including plans to move,
             substance abuse, significant psychiatric problems, or dementia.
