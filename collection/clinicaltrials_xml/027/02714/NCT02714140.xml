  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite worldwide efforts to promote HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT), rates of testing
      remain low. Understanding how high risk groups decide to test and adapting available testing
      options to their preferences has the potential to broadly improve HCT uptake and
      cost-effectiveness. This study proposes to use a Discrete Choice Experiment, a survey method
      increasingly used by health economists for the design of patient-centered health care
      options, to rigorously quantify HIV testing preferences among two high-risk populations,
      identify their preferred testing options, and evaluate, in a pragmatic randomized controlled
      trial (RCT), the effect of a preference-based HIV counseling and testing (PB-HCT)
      intervention on testing uptake. At a time of heightened focus on health preferences research
      and patient-centered care, this study evaluates the critical link between preference-based
      intervention design and efficacy. If the RCT indicates that PB-HCT increases testing rates,
      the testing options evaluated in this R01 can be offered to high-risk populations in the
      study area, and the preference elicitation method and tools can be used to inform the design
      of testing options that better match the preferences of other high-risk populations and in
      other settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV counseling and testing (HCT) is a highly cost-effective intervention for increasing
      serostatus awareness, a point of entry into HIV care and treatment, and an important means
      of primary and secondary HIV prevention. Public health officials have called for dramatic
      increases in HIV testing to achieve an HIV-free generation. Yet, testing rates are
      plateauing and rates of repeat-testing among those with ongoing risk remain low. Thus, there
      is a need to better understand and address deterrents of HIV testing.

      Evaluations of population preferences for testing have typically focused on the
      acceptability of specific venue-based testing options, such as home-based,
      provider-initiated, or workplace testing, usually without consideration or offer of other
      options. Results from these assessments do not probe the potential diversity in testing
      preferences of target populations; they do not ascertain how individuals value diverse
      characteristics of testing options; nor can they identify combinations of testing options
      that could maximize uptake of testing. The investigators posit that systematically designed
      HIV testing interventions, matched specifically to the heterogeneous preferences of diverse
      target populations, hold potential to greatly improve uptake of testing.

      In this study the investigators will extend the use of the DCE method to design an HIV
      testing intervention that is matched to the specific preferences of two high-risk
      populations and to establish, in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, whether a
      Preference-Based HIV Counseling and Testing (PB-HCT) intervention increases uptake of HIV
      testing. In short, the investigators are adapting concepts from health and behavioral
      economics, marketing, and patient-centered care to apply a groundbreaking, client-focused
      perspective to the context of HIV testing.

      This application will address the following Specific Aims:

      Aim 1. Quantitatively describe the HIV testing preferences of two high-risk populations.
      Hypothesis: HIV testing preferences differ between different high-risk populations. The
      investigators will develop and conduct DCE surveys with 200 female barworkers and 200 male
      Kilimanjaro mountain porters, two of the highest HIV risk populations in Moshi, Tanzania, in
      order to describe their preferences for actionable characteristics of HIV testing options.
      DCEs will quantify the relative importance of characteristics such as home-based vs.
      facility-based testing, venipuncture vs. finger prick vs. oral swab, individual vs. couples
      counseling, weekday vs. weekend testing, or the availability of services such as health
      check-ups, for individuals' testing decisions.

      Aim 2. Compare the HIV testing preferences within each high-risk population to the
      characteristics of existing testing options and identify feasible, more preferred
      alternatives. Hypothesis: Multiple distinct and feasible testing options can be identified
      that are predicted to better match the preferences of high-risk populations. The
      investigators will use latent class analysis of DCE choice data from Aim 1 to identify
      distinct sets of testing preferences within each high-risk population. Comparisons of each
      risk group's preferences with the characteristics of existing testing options will be used
      to identify, separately for each group, a set of two or more feasible new testing options,
      or variations of existing testing options, that are predicted to be more preferred and whose
      uptake can be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Aim 3.

      Aim 3. Conduct an RCT to evaluate whether an HIV testing intervention, designed to match the
      testing preferences of two high-risk populations, increases testing uptake relative to a
      default option. Hypothesis: A preference-based HCT intervention increases the uptake of
      testing. Representative samples of 600 female barworkers and 600 male mountain porters will
      be randomized into two groups. Group A participants will be offered the set of predicted
      more-preferred PB-HCT options identified in Aim 2 and a default option; Group B participants
      will be offered an equal number of predicted less-preferred options and the default option.
      Uptake of testing and the cost-effectiveness of PB-HCT will be assessed at 6 and 12 months.

      The findings from this project have significant public health relevance. The proposed study
      will a) rigorously characterize the HIV testing preferences of two high-risk populations; b)
      identify feasible HIV testing interventions that are predicted to increase HCT uptake; and
      c) identify the effect of a preference-informed HIV testing intervention on rates of
      testing. More generally, this study evaluates the critical link between an intervention that
      is systematically designed to match a population's preferences and the efficacy of that
      intervention. If successful, preference assessments among small samples from key populations
      could be used widely as an implementation research tool to inform the design of diverse HIV
      prevention, testing, and treatment interventions; preference-informed interventions, in
      turn, hold potential to broadly increase intervention uptake and efficacy, both
      internationally and in the United States.

The date and location of participants' most recent HIV test will be ascertained; participants who did not test using either the more-preferred, less-preferred, or default options, will be asked if they had tested elsewhere. If they had not, they will be reminded of the options, and offered an incentive of 5,000 Tanzanian Shilling (~$3) to present for testing using any of the options; the incentive will be paid at the testing location.</description>
