      This study is designed to provide evidence of efficacy of S-649266 in the treatment of
      serious infections in adult patients with either hospital-acquired pneumonia
      (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP),
      complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), or bloodstream infections (BSI)/sepsis caused by
      carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.

             carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative infection for a continuous duration of more than
             24 hours in cUTI, or 36 hours in HAP/VAP/HCAP or BSI/sepsis during the 72 hours
             leading to Randomization
