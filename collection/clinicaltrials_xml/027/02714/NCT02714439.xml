  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a different type of medical equipment called
      &quot;High-Resolution Microendoscope&quot; for the diagnosis of cervical pre-cancerous lesions and
      cervical cancer. We want to compare the patients' clinical findings using the current
      equipment that we have in clinic with the clinical findings using the new equipment that we
      are testing on this research project. If the new equipment is proven to give comparable
      findings with the current equipment that we are using, doctors might be able to offer a
      diagnosis and treat cervical lesions in one visit. It might not be necessary to wait for
      cervical biopsies to come back before women would receive the indicated treatment. Patient
      is being asked to participate because they have been diagnosed with an abnormal Papanicolaou
      (PAP) smear, and they need to have a colposcopic examination to determine the reason for
      their abnormal PAP smear and receive treatment.

      Participant will start their examination with the colposcopic evaluation using the current
      equipment as determined by standard of care. But, if cervical biopsies are indicated, before
      performing participant's biopsies, for research purposes only- researchers will:

        -  Apply a substance called Proflavine 0.01% to participant's cervix

        -  Researchers will re-evaluate participant's cervix with the new equipment we are
           testing- The High-Resolution Microendoscope

        -  After completing this re-evaluation, researchers will continue with the standard of
           care protocol and will perform participant's cervical biopsies if indicated.

      The entire re-evaluation with the new equipment should add less than 10 minutes to the
      standard examination.

      When a woman is found to have an abnormal PAP smear, depending on the findings and clinical
      history, most women will need to be further evaluated with a colposcope in order to
      understand the reason for the abnormal PAP and determine the best 2 of 7 treatment. This is
      called colposcopic examination and it is the standard of care. This procedure is performed
      in the clinic, patient is positioned on the examining table the same way she is positioned
      for a Pap smear, a speculum is placed inside the vaginal canal, and certain substances are
      applied to the cervix in order to identify cervical lesions. These substances might include
      acetic acid and/or lugol. The application of these substances helps to delineate the
      abnormal cervical areas that might need to be biopsied. For the purpose of this research
      study, before obtaining the biopsies, a second evaluation will be performed using the
      equipment that is being studied (High- Resolution Microendoscope) and using a different
      substance that will be applied to the cervix. This substance is called Proflavine 0.01%.
      Proflavine is a substance that has been used in fluorescent imaging around the world without
      any adverse effect reported.

      This second evaluation should not take more than 10 minutes. After completing this second
      evaluation, participant's clinical examination and clinical visit should continue as
      routine.

      There are no known risks associated with the equipment that will be used in this study.

      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also determined that the device that researchers
      will use during this research study meets the definition of non-significant risk device
      under the FDA regulations.

      The anticipated total number of subjects involved in the study will be 250 women. All these
      anticipated participating women would be from The University of Texas Medical Branch. The
      length of time for patient's participation is 1 year. However, during participant's year of
      enrollment they might have only one examination, during one of their visits, using the
      research equipment.
