  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the investigational product GL-ONC1
      in combination with eculizumab. GL-ONC1, a vaccinia virus, has been genetically modified for
      use as a potential anti-cancer drug to destroy cancer cells. Vaccinia virus has been used
      successfully in the past as smallpox vaccine in millions of people worldwide. Eculizumab is
      a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. This drug is designed to inhibit the activity
      of a protein called complement. Complement is part of the body's immune system that destroys
      and removes foreign particles. Evidence from laboratory tests suggest eculizumab may allow
      GL-ONC1 to stay in the body longer before being cleared by the immune system, which may help
      destroy more cancer cells.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase 1b dose escalation study evaluating the safety
      and effect of the oncolytic virus GL-ONC1 administered intravenously, with or without
      eculizumab, prior to surgery in patients with advanced solid organ tumors.

      GL-ONC1 has been investigated in early stage clinical trials in the United States and Europe
      via systemic delivery as monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, and via
      regional delivery as monotherapy. GL-ONC1 treatment was well tolerated across different
      malignancies, routes of administration, and monotherapy as well as combination therapy
      protocols. The ability of GL-ONC1 to infect tumor tissue and kill tumor cells was
      demonstrated. In addition, virus-induced immune activation and elevation of serum markers
      linking to a favorable antitumor immune response have been observed.

      Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to inhibit the activity of a protein called
      complement which is part of the body's innate immune system. Evidence from laboratory tests
      suggest eculizumab may allow GL-ONC1 to stay in the body longer before being cleared by the
      immune system.

      The goals of this study are to evaluate the safety of concurrent systemic administration of
      eculizumab and GL-ONC1 and to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profile of
      GL-ONC1 in vivo.
