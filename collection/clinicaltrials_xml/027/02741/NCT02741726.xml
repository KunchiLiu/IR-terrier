  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of dual acupoints and single acupoint
      transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) pretreatment on incidence of
      Post-Mastectomy Pain Syndrome(PMPS) in patients undergoing operation of breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to three groups, receiving 30min TEAS before anesthesia
      respectively. The acupoints of dual point group are bilateral Neiguan points(PC6) combined
      with Danzhong point(RN17), single point group is bilateral Neiguan points(PC6), and the
      false stimulation group only attach electrodes without electric current. The frequency of
      TEAS is set to 2/15 Hz. Intraoperative anesthetic dosage of propofol and remifentanil was
      recorded. Three and six months after surgery, follow-up about chronic pain was made by
      telephone or face-to-face using the follow-up questionnaire. The adverse events were
      recorded.
