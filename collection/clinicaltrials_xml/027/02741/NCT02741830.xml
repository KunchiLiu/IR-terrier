    <textblock>
      This cross sectional, two cohort study seeks to investigate both anatomic outcome and
      subjective, functional outcome of uterosacral ligament suspension versus robotic
      sacrocolpopexy and compare patient satisfaction, bladder function, sexual function and
      complication rate for each procedure.This study will provide a better understanding about
      the durability of these procedures and long term complication.

    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem affecting many women and there is a 12.6% lifetime
      risk of undergoing reconstructive pelvic surgery. There are several surgical options
      available to patients undergoing reconstruction for pelvic organ prolapse, however
      addressing the apex is recommended to achieve the most durable outcomes. Two of the most
      commonly performed procedures for apical prolapse repair are uterosacral ligament suspension
      and robotic sacrocolpopexy.

      High uterosacral ligament suspension is a native tissue repair which is performed by
      affixing the vaginal apex to the bilateral uterosacral ligaments using permanent or
      delayed-absorbable sutures. This is performed typically in a vaginal approach.
      Sacrocolpopexy is a performed by attaching the anterior and posterior vaginal walls to the
      sacral promontory using synthetic mesh, typically polypropylene. This procedure can be
      performed by an abdominal approach, a laparoscopic approach or with the assistance of the da
      Vinci robotic system. In recent years, robotic sacrocolpopexy has largely replaced the
      abdominal approach, and become the procedure of choice for minimally invasive surgeons.

      Most studies evaluating sacrocolpopexy outcomes were performed prior to the popularity of
      robotics and therefore concentrate on abdominal sacrocolpopexy.

      This cross sectional, two cohort study will compare outcomes of uterosacral ligament
      suspension versus robotic sacrocolpopexy and will give pelvic surgeons a better
      understanding about the durability of these procedures, and possible longer term
      complication rates.

      Subjects will be contacted and asked to come to the office for a visit and completion of
      questionnaires. If they cannot come to the office, an Informed Consent Form (ICF) and
      questionnaires will be mailed to them to complete and return separately.
