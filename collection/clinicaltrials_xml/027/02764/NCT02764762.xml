      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of triple combination therapy with an
      anti-integrin [vedolizumab intravenous (IV)], a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist
      [adalimumab subcutaneously (SC)], and an immunomodulator (oral methotrexate) on endoscopic
      remission in participants with newly-diagnosed Crohn's disease stratified at higher risk for
      complications.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to
      treat people who have Crohn's Disease. This study will look at the endoscopic remission and
      mucosal healing of gastrointestinal tract of people who take vedolizumab as triple
      combination therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 patients. Participants will receive triple
      combination therapy which includes:

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg

        -  Adalimumab 160/80/40 mg

        -  Methotrexate 15 mg

      All participants will receive vedolizumab IV infusion on Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22 along with
      adalimumab 160 mg, SC injection at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, then 40 mg once at Week 4 and
      every 2 weeks thereafter until Week 26 along with methotrexate tablets orally, once weekly
      from Weeks 0 up to Week 34. In monotherapy phase, all participants will receive vedolizumab
      IV infusion once at Weeks 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, 70, 78, 86, 94 and 102.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States and Canada. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 128 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, plus a final visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a safety follow-up
      assessment. Participants will also participate in a long-term safety questionnaire, by
      phone, at 18 weeks and 26 weeks (6 months) from the last dose of study drug.

    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission is defined as simple endoscopic score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) scale score from 0-2. The SES-CD evaluates 4 endoscopic variables (ulcer size, proportion of the surface area that is ulcerated, proportion of the surface area affected, and stenosis in 5 colonic segments evaluated during ileocolonoscopy (ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum). The score for each endoscopic variable is sum of values obtained for each segment. The SES-CD total is the sum of the 4 endoscopic variable scores from 0 to 56, where higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>
