      The research aims to investigate how gluten-free oats affect the gastrointestinal health in
      celiac disease by analyzing the effects of gluten-free oats on the intestinal parameters and
      on the composition of the gut microbiota and the metabolic profile of celiac patients. The
      study is divided into two parts.

      Part 1 will be conducted as a double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled cross-over
      study. Celiacs who avoid oats because of gastrointestinal symptoms will be recruited as
      subjects. The aim is to recruit 15 participants for the part 1. The study will be conducted
      with a cross-over setting, where the subjects will go through the exposure meal and
      SmartPill ingestion two times (oat and placebo) in randomized order. The study meals are
      identical in appearance and fiber content. After consuming the meal subjects will ingest the
      SmartPill capsule, which will send data on intestinal pH, pressure and temperature to the
      external portable device. Before and during the passage of capsule the subjects will fill a
      symptom and food diary. The capsule will exit the body in 1 to 3 days and the data collected
      by the external device will be collected and analyzed. Before the oat/placebo exposure the
      subjects will give a fecal and a blood sample that will be used in part 2 to represent the
      oat-avoiding celiac group (group 1).

      In part 2 both celiacs and healthy controls will be recruited and they will be divided into
      three groups: oat-avoiding celiacs (1), oat-consuming celiacs (2) and healthy controls (3).
      Recruiting aim for each group is 15 subjects. In addition to dietary data, a blood and a
      fecal sample will be collected from the subjects. The gut microbiota will be analyzed from
      the fecal sample, focusing especially on the amount and diversity of Bifidobacterium genus.
      The metabolic products will be analyzed from the fecal and blood sample using nuclear
      magnetic resonance analysis (NMR). The gut microbiota composition will be analyzed with
      next-generation DNA sequencing techniques.
