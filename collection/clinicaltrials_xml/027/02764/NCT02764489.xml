      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  1. To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity
           (FEIBA component Factor II (FII) and safety of FEIBA reconstituted in a reduced volume
           of sterile water for injection (SWFI) versus regular volume SWFI, administered at the
           standard infusion rate of 2 U/min/kg

        -  2. To evaluate the safety of infusing reduced volume FEIBA at increased rates of 4 and
           10 U/min/kg in comparison to the standard rate of 2 U/min/kg

             scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational
             device during the course of this study

         11. Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator

         12. Clinically significant medical, psychiatric or cognitive illness, or recreational
             drug/alcohol use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect participant
             safety or compliance
