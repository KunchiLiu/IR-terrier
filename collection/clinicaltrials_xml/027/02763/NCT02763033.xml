  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are evaluating the feasibility, safety and early efficacy of administering a
      commercially available dietary supplement containing potato-based resistant starch to
      subjects undergoing allogeneic SCT (stem cell transplant). The intervention will begin
      immediately prior to the conditioning phase and continue through day 100. Investigators
      hypothesize that short term administration of a resistant starch is capable of increasing
      levels of butyrate within the intestine that will reduce rates of acute GVHD
      (Graft-Versus-Host Disease).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects undergoing matched related full intensity allogeneic HSCT (hematopoietic
             stem cell transplantation)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years for the feasibility phase. Age ≥10 years old AND ≥50 kg for the phase
             II portion.

          -  Karnofsky &gt;70%, (Karnofsky Performance Status: an attempt to quantify cancer
             patients' general well-being and activities of daily life. The score ranges from 0 to
             100 where 100 is &quot;perfect&quot; health and 0 is death.)

          -  Subjects must be able to swallow capsules/tablets

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Availability of an HLA (human leukocyte antigen) matched related donor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

          -  Patients with a history of gastric bypass surgery.

          -  Patients with active Clostridium difficile infection at the time of study enrollment.
             Active infection is defined as a stool sample positive for Clostridium difficile
             toxin via EIA (enzyme immunoassay) and either symptoms (frequent loose stools) OR
             imaging findings consistent with toxic megacolon.

          -  Patients actively enrolled on any other GVHD prevention trial.

          -  Any physical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would post unacceptable risk to the patient or raise concern that the patient would
             not comply with protocol procedures.
