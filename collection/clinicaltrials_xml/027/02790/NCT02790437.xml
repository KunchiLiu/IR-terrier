  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the study drug IdeS in
      patients who are on the waiting list for kidney transplant and have previously undergone
      desensitization unsuccessfully or in whom effective desensitization will be highly unlikely.
      At study entry, the patients will have an available deceased or live donor with a positive
      crossmatch test. The study will assess IdeS efficacy and safety in removing Donor Specific
      Antibodies (DSAs) and thereby convert a positive crossmatch test to negative.

      The study will assess the IdeS efficacy in creating a negative crossmatch test (CXM) in
      patients who exhibit donor specific antibodies (DSA) and have a positive crossmatch test to
      their available live or deceased donors. The first 3 patients in this study will receive a
      kidney from a deceased donor. The study will primarily examine the efficacy of IdeS in
      creating a negative CXM. The first 3 patients will receive one dose of 0.25 mg/kg BW IdeS on
      study day 0. If it is considered safe and negative crossmatch test is not achieved after the
      first dose, an additional IdeS infusion can be given within 2 days of the first infusion.
      The dose schedule may be increased to 0.5 mg/kg BW given once or twice after the first 3
      patients have been tested. The decision to escalate the dose will be done after evaluation
      of safety and efficacy.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients on the kidney transplant waitlist who have previously undergone
             desensitization unsuccessfully or in whom effective desensitization will be highly
             unlikely. The breadth and strength of sensitization will predict an extremely low
             likelihood of successful desensitization or kidney paired donation.

          -  Patients with a live or deceased donor with a positive crossmatch test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with IdeS

          -  Previous high dose IVIg treatment (2 g/kg BW) within 28 days prior to IdeS treatment

          -  Lactating or pregnant females

          -  Women of child-bearing age who are not willing or able to practice FDA-approved forms
             of contraception

          -  HIV-positive patients

          -  Patients who test positive for HBV infection [positive HBVsAg, HBVcAb, or HBVeAg/DNA]
             or HCV infection [positive Anti-HCV (EIA) and confirmatory HCV RIBA ]

          -  Patients with active tuberculosis

             failure &gt; NYHA (New York Heart Association) grade 3, unstable coronary disease or
             oxygen dependent COPD

          -  Individuals deemed unable to comply with the protocol

          -  Patients with active CMV or EBV infection as defined by CMV-specific serology (IgG or
             IgM) and confirmed by quantitative PCR with or without a compatible illness

          -  Patients with a history of clinically significant thrombotic episodes, and patients
             with active peripheral vascular disease

          -  Patients should not have received investigational drugs within 4 half-lives (or
             similar)

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity to IdeS infusions

          -  Patients who have a live donor and test positive for ImmunoCap anti-IdeS IgE
