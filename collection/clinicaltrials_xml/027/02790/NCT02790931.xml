  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the effects of a personalized
      intervention of exercises for the ankle-foot complex, supervised by a physical therapist and
      also via software, in gait velocity of patients with diabetic neuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will be performed with 46 patients with diabetic neuropathy.
      The participants will be randomly assigned into either a control group (recommended foot
      care by international consensus with no exercises) or an intervention group which will
      receive 12-week physical therapy exercises, twice a week, under the supervision of a
      physiotherapist, and twice a week being remotely supervised by a software at home. Every
      exercise has its own progression depending on the subjects' execution, increasing in
      intensity and difficulty.

      The subjects will be evaluated in 5 different moments. The self-selected walking speed will
      be investigated with photocells and the incidence of foot ulcers will be registered on a web
      software during one year in a longitudinal study. Through force platform and infrared
      cameras, the kinetics and kinematics during gait will allow assessment of joint moments,
      power during propulsion, and foot and ankle range of motion.

      The hypothesis is that the personalized exercises for the ankle-foot complex via software
      will increase the self-selected gait speed, reduce incidence of plantar ulcers and their
      risk, increase health and functionality of the feet, increase feet strength and ankle
      isometric torque, maintain temperature of the feet, and produce beneficial biomechanical
      changes during gait.
