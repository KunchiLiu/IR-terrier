  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase
      I study of the effects of naloxegol, a novel mu-opioid antagonist, on gastrointestinal and
      colonic transit in the presence or absence of the mu-opiate, codeine. There is a need to
      develop effective medications for the treatment of opiate-induced constipation and other
      motility disorders. Currently available opiates are complicated by addictive potential and
      induction of troublesome constipation.
