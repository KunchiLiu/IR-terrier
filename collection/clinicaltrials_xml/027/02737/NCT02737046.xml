      The investigators propose to use Belinostat in combination with AZT as consolidation therapy
      for the treatment of ATLL.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATLL is an aggressive malignancy caused by HTLV-1. ATLL cannot be cured by conventional
      chemotherapy thus urging the development of new therapeutic strategies. HDAC inhibitors are
      broadly active anti-neoplastic agents that can be exploited for the treatment of ATLL as it
      has been demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of HDACs promotes acetylation of
      nucleosomes and chromatin unwinding at the HTLV-1 5' LTR, which results in transcription of
      the viral genome.

      Belinostat, a potent pan HDAC inhibitor, causes H3 subunit acetylation and induces HTLV-1
      Tax expression in cultured ATLL cells resulting in dose-dependent apoptosis. Further,
      Belinostat blocks constitutive expression of NF-κB, and increases apoptosis in the presence
      of AZT.
