      Primary objective:

        1. To evaluate the safety of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds (DSW)
           for Phase I in terms of Incidence of treatment-related AEs and SAEs (including
           infections and bleeding)

        2. To evaluate the efficacy for Phase I+II of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor
           site wounds (DSW) in terms of The healing time from DSW creation to 100%
           re-epithelialization

      Secondary objective:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds
           (DSW) in secondary efficacy endpoints

        2. To evaluate the safety of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds (DSW)
           in secondary safety endpoints

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        A patient is eligible for the study if all of the following apply:

          1. Female/male patients, aged 20-65 years old

          2. Presenting a split-thickness skin graft donor site wound with a minimum size of 15
             cm2, with a minimum width of 3 cm and with an approximate thickness of 0.38mm. The
             graft cannot be harvested from a site from which a skin graft was previously
             obtained.

          3. If the primary wound is a result of a thermal or chemical burn, the total body
             surface area of the said wound must be less than 15%.

          4. Females of childbearing potential must have a documented negative serum pregnancy
             test and must agree to use highly effective contraceptives during the treatment
             period

          5. Willing to comply with the study protocol and to sign the Informed Consent Form

        Any patient meeting any of the exclusion criteria will be excluded from study

             donor site healing (e.g. the presence of a bleeding disorder, capillary fragility,
             venous or arterial disorder directly affecting the donor site to be treated, known or
             suspected systemic malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus infection, renal or
             liver disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, poor
             nutritional status).

             4 weeks prior to study entry are excluded from the study:

               2. therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (e.g. Plavix, Coumadin, Heparin, low
                  molecular weight Heparin) for pre-existing medical conditions, for whom a dose
                  interruption from Screening through the end of the study period is
                  contraindicated.

          4. Autoimmune disease, e.g. lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis.

          5. Hematologic disease, malignancy or hypo-immunity.

          6. History of HIV or congenital immunodeficiency. Note: HIV = human immunodeficiency
             virus

          7. History of alcoholism or drug abuse.

          8. Have used any tobacco product within 1 week prior to treatment.

          9. Patients previously treated with any cell-based product, including autologous tissue
             at the treatment site.

         10. Received an investigational drug, device or biological/bioactive treatment within 30
             days prior to study entry.

         11. Any clinical condition or significant concurrent disease judged by the investigator
             to complicate the evaluation of the trial treatment.

         12. History of sensitivity to bovine or porcine origin materials
