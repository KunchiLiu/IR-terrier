      The current study aimed to investigate whether oxytocin (OXT) had effect on placebo
      analgesia.

      The current study included three phases to investigate oxytocin effect on placebo analgesia:

        1. In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo controlled design study to investigate the
           intranasal OXT (24IU) treatment in 60 healthy male subjects using working memory task.

        2. In a single-blind(subjects were informed that the treatment was oxytocin),
           between-subject, placebo controlled design study to investigate the intranasal OXT
           (24IU) treatment in 60 healthy male subjects using working memory task.They were
           informed that oxytocin would increase memory perfomance.

        3. In a single-blind(subjects were informed that the treatment was oxytocin),
           between-subject, placebo controlled design study to investigate the intranasal OXT
           (24IU) treatment in 60 healthy male subjects using working memory task. But the
           subjects were told that oxytocin would decrease the performance. Memory performance was
           included as dependant factor. All subjects completed a range of questionnaires
           measuring personality and affective traits and levels of anxiety: Positive and Negative
           Affect Schedule (PANAS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression
           Inventory (BDI), Cheek and Buss shyness Scale (CBSS), Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ),
           Empathy Quotient(EQ),Behavioral Inhibitionactivation System Scale(BASBIS) and Raven
           Standard Progressive Matrices Test (SPM).
