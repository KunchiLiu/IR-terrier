    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare two doses of abituzumab with placebo and determine
      whether abituzumab is more effective, safer, will be better tolerated and can provoke better
      immune response than placebo in the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD who already receive
      constant doses of mycophenolate.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are eligible for this trial if they fulfill all of the following inclusion
             criteria:

          -  Female or male subjects aged between 18 and 75 years of age who provide informed
             written consent.

          -  Subjects fulfilling the 2013 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) /European League
             Against Rheumatism criteria for classification of systemic sclerosis (SSc).

          -  Disease duration of less than (&lt;) 7 years from first non-Raynaud's symptom.

          -  According to central readings: Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide
             (DLCO) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) predicted, Forced vital capacity
             (FVC) 40% to 85% predicted, and ratio of FVC % predicted to Diffusion capacity of the
             lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) % predicted &lt;1.8. If these criteria are met, then
             High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of lungs will be performed, and must show
             at least 5% fibrosis for subjects to be eligible.

          -  Use of mycophenolate (MMF) for at least 6 months before the screening visit. The dose
             must be stable for at least 3 months prior to screening and be in the range as
             follows: MMF 1.5 to 3 gram/day, MPS 1080 to 2160 mg/day.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of
             contraception to prevent pregnancy for 4 weeks before randomization and must agree to
             continue to practice adequate contraception for the duration of their participation
             in the trial (up to the last Safety Follow-Up Visit). For the purposes of this trial,
             women of childbearing potential are defined as &quot;All female subjects after puberty
             unless they are post-menopausal for at least 2 years or are surgically sterile.&quot;
             Highly effective contraception is defined as 2 barrier methods (eg, female diaphragm
             and male condoms); or 1 barrier method with at least one of the following:
             spermicide, a hormonal method, or an intrauterine device. Note that because
             mycophenolate affects the metabolism of oral contraceptives and may reduce their
             effectiveness, women receiving mycophenolate who are using oral contraceptives for
             birth control should employ an additional contraceptive method (eg, male or female
             barrier method).
