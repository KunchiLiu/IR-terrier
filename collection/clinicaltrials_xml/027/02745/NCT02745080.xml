    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of secukinumab monotherapy
      and adalimumab monotherapy in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who are naïve to
      biologic therapy and are intolerant or having inadequate response to conventional DMARDs

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An ACR20 response is defined by at least 20% decrease in the swollen and tender joint count, and at least 20% improvements in 3 of the following 5 criteria: physical disability on the Health Assessment Questionnaire; pain score on a visual analog scale; patient global assessment; physician global assessment; and acute phase reactant [either erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) or high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)]</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PASI90</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASI takes into account the extent of the disease, as well as the severity of erythema, scaling, and thickness in different body areas affected by psoriasis. A PASI90 represents an improvement in the PASI score of at least 90% as compared with baseline</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ACR50 response</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An ACR50 response is defined by at least 50% decrease in the swollen and tender joint count, and at least 50% improvements in 3 of the following 5 criteria: physical disability on the Health Assessment Questionnaire; pain score on a visual analog scale; patient global assessment; physician global assessment; and acute phase reactant [either erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)]</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI score), relative to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The disability assessment component of the HAQ assesses a subjects level of functional ability and includes questions of fine movements of the upper extremity, locomotor activities of the lower extremity, and activities that involve both upper and lower extremeties.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resolution of enthesitis</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Enthesitis refers to inflammation of entheses, the site where ligaments or tendons insert into the bones. Resolution is defined as the absence of recorded enthesitis; conducted by the study assessor.</description>
