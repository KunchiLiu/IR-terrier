      Real-world data on the effects of a fixed-dose combination Long-acting beta agonists +
      long-acting antimuscarinic agent (LABA+LAMA) therapy with tiotropium and olodaterol
      administered in a single device, in COPD patients who need treatment with two long-acting
      bronchodilators, is not available. This is a self-controlled study design enrolling
      consented COPD patients who will be treated with Spiolto Respimat according to the approved
      Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

          3. Patients diagnosed with COPD and requiring long-acting dual bronchodilation (LAMA +
             LABA) treatment according to approved Spiolto Respimat Summary of Product
