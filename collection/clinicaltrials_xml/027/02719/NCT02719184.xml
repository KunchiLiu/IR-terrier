      The study will include 125 healthy subjects (ex-smoker without any airflow limitation), 125
      COPD GOLD (global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease) I , 125 COPD GOLD II, 125
      COPD GOLD III and up to 40 (with a minimum of 20) patients with COPD and A1AT
      (Alpha1-Antitrypsin) deficiency (ZZ genotype). Soluble and imaging biomarkers will be
      investigated addressing different aspects of disease pathways postulated to be relevant for
      COPD progression.

        Inclusion Criteria Specific for Patients with COPD

        - Patients must have a current diagnosis of COPD made by a physician at least 3 months
        prior to Visit 1 and a mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale) score of 1
        or more. The diagnosis of COPD must be in accordance with GOLD Guidelines and must be
        documented by the following criteria: Known relatively stable airway obstruction with a
        post-bronchodilator FEV1(Forced Expiratory Volume in first second)/FVC (Forced Vital
        Capacity) &lt; lower limit of normal (GLI 2012)

          -  The current COPD must be mild, moderate or severe based on lung functions and
             symptoms and the clinical situation must have stabilized for at least 6 weeks prior
             to Visit 1. The following definitions adapted from the GOLD Guidelines apply:

               1. mild: post-broncho-dilator FEV1 predicted &gt;=80% (GLI 2012) at Visit 1

               2. moderate: 50%&lt;= post-broncho-dilator FEV1 predicted &lt; 80% (GLI 2012) without
                  chronic respiratory failure at Visit 1

               3. severe: 30%&lt;= post-bronchodilator FEV1 predicted &lt;50% (GLI 2012) without chronic
                  respiratory failure at Visit 1

          -  Patients must be on stable therapy for at least 6 months Inclusion Criteria Specific

          -  Normal lung function values at Visit 1 with a documented post-bronchodilator FEV1
             &gt;=80% of predicted normal (GLI 2012) and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &gt;= lower
             limit of normal

          -  Mean DLCO over all acceptable measurements at Visit 1 of &gt;= 70% of predicted normal
