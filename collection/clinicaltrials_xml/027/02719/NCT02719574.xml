  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/1b study will utilize a multicenter, open-label dose-escalation design to
      evaluate the safety, PK, and PD of FT-2102 (single agent) and FT-2102 + azacitidine
      (combination agent) administered via one or more intermittent dosing schedules.
      Approximately 48 patients will be enrolled in the dose-escalation portion of this study in
      one or more schedules followed by approximately 14 patients in expansion cohorts
