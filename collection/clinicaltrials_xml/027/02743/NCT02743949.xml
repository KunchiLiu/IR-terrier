    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of vonoprazan compared to esomeprazole
      for preventing heartburn symptoms over a 4-week treatment period in participants who have a
      partial response to treatment with esomeprazole.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vonoprazan. Vonoprazan is being tested to
      treat people who have symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a partial
      response to treatment with a high dose of esomeprazole. This study will look at improvement
      in heartburn symptoms in participants who take vonoprazan compared to esomeprazole.

      The study will enroll approximately 213 patients. All participants will receive esomeprazole
      or esomeprazole placebo-matching capsules (this is a capsule that looks like esomeprazole
      but has no active ingredient) during a 7-week run-in period. Participants will then be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment
      groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study
      (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Vonoprazan 20 mg

        -  Vonoprazan 40 mg

        -  Esomeprazole 40 mg

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study. All participants will be asked to record heartburn symptoms in a diary every morning
      upon waking and every evening before going to sleep.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Europe. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 12 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 1 week after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

          4. Has, in the judgment of the investigator, clinically significant abnormal
             hematological parameters of hemoglobin, hematocrit, or erythrocytes at Screening.

          5. Has a history of erosive esophagitis of Los Angeles (LA) Classification Grade B
             severity or worse prior to screening or at Screening endoscopy.

          6. Has a history of or any coexisting diseases affecting the esophagus (eg, Barrett's
             esophagus, eosinophilic esophagitis, esophageal varices, scleroderma, viral or fungal
             infection, or esophageal stricture), history of radiation therapy or cryotherapy to
             the esophagus, caustic trauma, or physiochemical trauma such as sclerotherapy to the
             esophagus.

          7. Has &quot;alarm features&quot; in symptomatology, including odynophagia, severe dysphagia,
             bleeding, weight loss, anemia, and blood in stool, pointing to a possible malignant
             disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Participants displaying &quot;alarm symptoms&quot;
             in addition to the &quot;typical&quot; gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms may be
             included based on endoscopic exclusion of malignancy.

          8. Has current or historical chest pain due to cardiac diseases (eg, within one year).

          9. Has had surgical treatment for GERD (eg, cardiaplasty), dilation of an esophageal
             stricture (other than Schatzki ring) or gastric or duodenal surgery, except simple
             oversew of an ulcer or endoscopic polypectomy of benign polyps.

         10. Has active gastric or duodenal ulcers which have been confirmed by endoscopy within
             30 days prior to Screening. Gastric or duodenal erosions are not exclusionary, unless
             considered severe and symptomatic by the investigator.

         11. Has had an acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage within 30 days prior to Screening.

         12. Has current or historical evidence of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or other
             hypersecretory condition.

         13. Has current or historical evidence of eosinophilic esophagitis (evidence may be based
             on the following: missing response to acid suppressive therapy, the presence of
             eosinophilia in histological probes of the esophageal mucosa, a normal pH profile of
             the distal esophagus, symptoms of dysphagia and food impaction). The exclusion of
             participants based on a predominance of the &quot;typical&quot; eosinophilic esophagitis
             symptoms only (as above) is considered acceptable. However, in participants with a
             predominance of &quot;typical&quot; symptoms and co-existing significant dysphagia and food
             impaction, the syndrome should be excluded by endoscopy with biopsy.

         14. Has a documented history (within 6 months prior to screening) of functional dyspepsia
             (suggested by the presence of one or more of the following symptoms: epigastric pain,
             postprandial fullness or early satiety), or irritable bowel syndrome or other
             gastrointestinal diseases which are not acid-related, and therefore, are
             nonresponsive to gastric acid-blocking treatment.

         15. Has a documented history of familial adenomatous polyposis.

         16. Has known intolerance, hypersensitivity or allergies to any PPI or their components
             (including lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, or
             esomeprazole), any component of vonoprazan, or antacid(s) selected as rescue
             medication for this study.

         17. Has a history of alcohol abuse, illegal drug use, or drug addiction within the 12
             months prior to Screening, or regularly consumes &gt;21 units of alcohol (1 unit = 12
             oz/300 mL beer, 1.5 oz/25 mL hard liquor/spirits, or 5 oz/100 mL wine) per week.
             Participants must have a negative drug screen at Screening.

         18. Has evidence of a serious uncontrolled concomitant disease including: clinically
             significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic,
             gastrointestinal, systemic, or endocrine disease or other abnormality (other than the
             disease being studied), which may impact the ability of the participant to
             participate or potentially confound the study results.

         19. Has planned, or is likely to require, in-patient surgery during the course of the
             study.

         20. Has a history of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin) within 3 years
             prior to Screening.

         21. Is known to have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or chronic hepatitis due to any
             etiology.

         22. Has abnormal laboratory values at Screening that suggest a clinically significant
             underlying disease or condition that may prevent the participant from completing the
             study.

         23. Has an alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or
             T-bilirubin level which exceeds upper limit of normal (ULN) set by the testing
             laboratory at the Screening.

         24. If female, the participant is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant
             before, during, or within 1 month after participating in this study; or intending to
             donate ova during such time period.

         25. Is required to take excluded medications or it is anticipated that the participant
             will require treatment with at least 1 of the disallowed concomitant medications
             during the study.

         26. In the opinion of the investigator, is unable to comply with the requirements of the
             study or is unsuitable for any reason.
