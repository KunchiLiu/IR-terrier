    <textblock>
      An esophageal heat exchange tube will be inserted in anesthetized surgical patients. Each
      patient will have 30 minutes of cooling (circulating fluid at 7 degrees C) and 30 minutes of
      warming (42 degrees C) with 15-minute recovery break in between. The primary outcome will be
      heat transfer, determined from inflow and outflow temperatures and fluid flow rate for
      cooling and warming modes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ECD is made with medical-grade silicone and has 3 ports; 2 coolant ports and a central
      port. The coolant ports of the ECD are connected to external heat exchanger while a third,
      central lumen simultaneously allows gastric decompression and drainage. The ECD can be
      inserted like a standard gastric tube.

      The aim of this prospective, interventional study is to quantify heat transfer during
      warming and cooling using the Esophageal Cooling Device in anesthetized patients having
      non-cardiac surgery.

      An esophageal heat exchange tube will be inserted in anesthetized surgical patients. Each
      will have 30 minutes of cooling (circulating fluid at 7 degrees C) and 30 minutes of warming
      (42 degrees C) with 15 -minute break in between; the order of the cooling and warming will
      be randomized. The primary outcome will be heat transfer, determined from inflow and outflow
      fluid temperatures and fluid flow rate assessed for both cooling and warming modes.
