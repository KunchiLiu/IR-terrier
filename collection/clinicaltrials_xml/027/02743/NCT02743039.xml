      The Northwestern University Two-Generation Child and Family Outcomes Study (NU2Gen) of the
      Community Action Project of Tulsa County's (CAP Tulsa's) CareerAdvance® program examine the
      effects of CareerAdvance® on child outcomes (e.g., child academic achievement and behavior).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAP Tulsa's Health Profession Opportunity Grant (HPOG II) involves a randomized control
      trial of CareerAdvance®'s impact on approximately 1,000 parents in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area.
      Through HPOG II, CAP Tulsa will participate in a national evaluation to measure the effects
      of program participation on adult educational and employment outcomes. The Northwestern
      University research team's subcontract through CAP Tulsa, as part of the HPOG II grant,
      involves a supplementary effectiveness study focusing on child outcomes. The study will
      employ: (1) primary data based on a brief parent survey at the time of program application;
      (2) secondary data on parents' progress in the CareerAdvance® program and other related
      community programs and employers (e.g., Madison Strategies Group's WorkAdvance Tulsa); and
      (3) child-level public elementary administrative data from local public school districts in
      Tulsa County, Oklahoma. Northwestern's study will be conducted in tandem with the national
      evaluation. Findings will have implications for how two-generation educational programs
      influence child development and will offer guidance on how to integrate this approach into
      Head Start and other school-based educational programming.
