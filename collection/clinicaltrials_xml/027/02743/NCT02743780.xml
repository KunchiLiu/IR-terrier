  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the clinical profile of topical-ocular MGV354
      merits further development for the indication of lowering intraocular pressure (IOP).

      Part 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of MGV354
      compared to placebo in healthy male and female subjects. Part 2 will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of MGV354 in a multiple ascending dose design (two highest tolerated doses from
      Part 1) compared to placebo when administered for 7 days to patients with ocular
      hypertension or glaucoma. Part 3 will explore the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a
      single dose level of MGV354 (maximum tolerated dose) compared to placebo when administered
      for 7 days in patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma.
