    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single arm, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Lutetium-177 Octreotate in patients with neuroendocrine tumors who has positive Somatostatin
      receptor identified by 68Ga-DOTATATE. 195 patients will be enrolled totally. Patient who has
      progressed with neuroendocrine tumor will be evaluated by the tumor board first and eligible
      patients will undergo diagnostic Ga 68 PET scan. Patients who showed Somatostatin will
      undergo 4 cycles of Lu-DOTATATE treatment. Dose adjustment for Cycle 2-4 will be made based
      on individualized dosimetry, as well as creatinine clearance and hematological parameters.
      Patients will be evaluated progression free survival at 12 months from last dose. Patients
      who are negative for somatostatin will not receive 68Ga-DOTATATE treatment but will be
      followed until progression and acts as control group.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Biopsy-proven neuroendocrine tumor

          2. ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          3. Ki-67 index ≤ 30%

          4. Evidence of progressive disease demonstrated by imaging within six months prior to
             study enrollment as defined by RECIST v1.1.

               -  Patients with objective evidence (imaging, or biochemical) that is insufficient
                  to be classified by RECIST 1.1 criteria can be eligible if after provincial
                  multidisciplinary tumor board discussion a consensus for progression eligibility
                  is reached.

               -  The tumor board would consider exemptions based on clinical and radiological
                  factors.

          5. Adequate lab parameters within 2 weeks of enrollment:

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 150 µmol/L

               -  GFR ≥30 mL/min

               -  Haemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L

               -  WBC ≥ 2 x 10^9/L

               -  platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

          6. Adequate liver function tests within 2 weeks of enrollment:

               -  total bilirubin ≤ 5 x ULN

               -  ALT ≤ 5 x ULN

               -  AST ≤ 5 x ULN

               -  alkaline phosphatase) ≤ 5 x ULN

          7. Signed informed consent

          8. Patients with extensive bone metastases (e.g. &gt;25% of bone marrow involvement are
             eligible but requires careful monitoring of hematological reserve

          9. Subject's willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Life expectancy &lt;12 weeks

          2. An option for curative surgical or medical therapy or local liver embolization is

          4. Systemic, biologic, other radioisotope, embolization therapies within ≤12 weeks prior
             to study enrollment. [long acting somatostatin analogs such as octreotide LAR® are
             eligible but must be switched to short acting when patient is confirmed in the
             diagnostic phase to be eligible for 177Lu and withheld prior to the administration of
             177Lu]. Somatostatin analog is to be withheld at least 24 hours prior to
             radiopharmaceutical administration. It may be resumed 7 days after.

          5. Prior radiotherapy to target lesion(s) within ≤12 weeks prior to study enrollment
             [radiotherapy to non-target lesions permitted].

          6. Prior radiotherapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow.

          7. Known brain metastases (unless metastases have been treated and are stable for ≥ 6
             months).

          8. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (fasting glucose &gt;12 mmol/L).

          9. Co-morbidities that may interfere with delivery of 177Lu (e.g. urinary incontinence).

         10. Secondary active cancer(s) with clinical or biochemical progression within the last 3
             years.

         11. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Female subjects must be surgically sterile or
             postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of
             therapy. All female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test (serum) prior to enrolment. Male subjects must be surgically sterile
             or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The
             definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal
             investigator or a designated associate

         12. Other condition, illness, psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation, 68Ga or 177Lu administration,
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and in the judgment of the
             investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
