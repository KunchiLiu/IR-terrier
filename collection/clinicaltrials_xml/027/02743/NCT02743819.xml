    <textblock>
      Phase II study evaluating the benefit of the combination of anti-PD1 (pembrolizumab) and
      anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab) antibodies in advanced melanoma. The study will determine the
      response rate of the combination and evaluate other clinical parameters such as
      progression-free survival and safety of the combination following anti-PD1/L1 antibody. The
      study will also provide the opportunity to investigate blood or tumor based factors that may
      predict response to anti-PD1 antibody in combination with anti-CTLA4.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the irRECIST* response rate of pembrolizumab with ipilimumab following initial
      progression or stable disease to anti-PD1/L1 antibody (or combination not containing
      anti-CTLA4) in subjects with advanced melanoma.

      Secondary Objective

        1. To summarize the progression-free survival (RECIST v1.1 and irRC) of the combination
           following prior treatment with anti-PD1/L1 antibody.

        2. To assess the safety of the combination following prior treatment with anti-PD1/L1
           antibody.

      Exploratory Objective:

      To evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment and other biospecimens before and after
      adding ipilimumab to pembrolizumab.

        The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject:

          1. Has received study therapy (including investigational device) as part of a clinical
             trial within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment, with the exclusion of an
             anti-PD1/L1 antibody given as either a single agent or non-CTLA-4 antibody containing
             combination.

             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             trial treatment.

          3. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          4. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          5. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 (excluding commercial or investigational anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies as
             single agents) or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately
                  from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         15. Has received prior therapy with an anti-CTLA4 agent.

         16. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

             [qualitative] is detected).

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

        Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
