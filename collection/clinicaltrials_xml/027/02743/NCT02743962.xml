    <textblock>
      Bladder pain syndrome is a condition where pain is experienced when the bladder fills with
      urine and eases briefly when the bladder empties. There can also be a constant need to
      urgently empty the bladder.

      The internal pelvic floor muscles in people with bladder pain syndrome can be tense and
      painful, and relaxing and stretching them may improve symptoms; reducing bladder pain,
      urgency and how often people have to empty their bladder.

      This pelvic floor release is done by specialist physiotherapists.Therapeutic wands, such as
      the TheraWandÂ®, are used routinely throughout the United Kingdom to allow people to relax
      and stretch their pelvic floor themselves. Using a therapeutic wand has been shown to be
      safe and to reduce pelvic pain, improve bladder and bowel symptoms and relax the pelvic
      floor muscles. However, this research was conducted mostly in men with pelvic pain.

      The aim of this study is to find out if using a therapeutic wand at home as well as having a
      specialist physiotherapist massage the pelvic floor gives any added benefit than just having
      the physiotherapy treatment. The investigators hope to find out if the therapeutic wand
      gives women a way of managing their symptoms independently in their own homes.

      A volunteer sample of ten women will be recruited and randomised into two groups, with
      descriptive analysis of their demographics at baseline. Both groups will receive six weeks
      of standard pelvic floor myofascial release by a specialist physiotherapist and one group
      will also use a therapeutic wand twice weekly at home. Outcome measures of bladder urgency,
      pain, health related quality of life and the perceived effect and ease of therapeutic wand
      use will be measured weekly for six weeks of treatment and then six weeks following
      treatment. A diary of therapeutic wand use, release exercises and medication use will also
      be kept for 3 months. Analysis of any significant difference in symptom change between the
      two groups and of subjective ease of wand use will then occur and inform the development of
      a randomised controlled trial.

    <description>This group will receive standard specialist physiotherapy intervention for bladder pain syndrome: dietary advice regarding fluid and fibre intake, advice regarding bladder retraining and 15 minutes manual intra-vaginal pelvic floor muscle myofascial release and gentle stretching each week for 6 weeks. They will be instructed to briefly contract and then fully relax their pelvic floor muscles independently (clothed, in a seated or lying position) for 5 minutes daily.</description>

    <description>This group will receive the standard specialist physiotherapy intervention for bladder pain syndrome for 6 weeks, but will also be provided with an intra-vaginal therapeutic wand and taught how to use it. They will then be asked to use the therapeutic wand at home twice a week to release and relax their pelvic floor muscles for 5 minutes.</description>

    <description>The therapeutic wand will be used to apply a gentle caudad pressure on the pelvic floor, encouraging a release and gentle stretch of the muscles. The participants will follow a protocol of sweeping gently along one side then the other to find tender or tight areas, and then to apply the wand to relax and stretch the muscles for up to 5 minutes in total, twice weekly for the duration of the study.</description>
