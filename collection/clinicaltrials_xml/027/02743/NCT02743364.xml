    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well simvastatin works in reducing pancreatitis
      (the inflammation of the pancreas) in patients with pancreatitis that occurs more than once
      (recurrent), has worsened quickly (acute), or has persisted or progressed over a long period
      of time (chronic). Simvastatin may decrease the inflammation of the pancreas by modulating
      the immune response responsible for inflammation. It is not yet known if simvastatin may be
      an effective treatment for pancreatitis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo on the change in
      secretin-stimulated peak bicarbonate concentration in the pancreatic fluid at 6 months
      post-treatment in patients hospitalized for acute or chronic pancreatitis, with a prior
      history of one or more episodes of acute pancreatitis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Change in the endoscopic ultrasound score (EUS). II. Change in fecal elastase. III.
      Change in serum and pancreatic fluid levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6,
      IL-10, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), and soluble (s)-fractalkine.

      IV. Change in pancreatic fluid levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers,
      e-cadherin and vimentin.

      V. Change in pancreatitis-related readmissions. VI. Change in Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
      oncogene homolog (KRAS) gene mutations in pancreatic fluid.

      VII. Change in quality of life score as measured by the quality of life questionnaire core
      30 (QLQ-C30) and quality of life questionnaire pancreatic modification (QLQ-PAN28) chronic
      pancreatitis (CP).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive simvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days.
