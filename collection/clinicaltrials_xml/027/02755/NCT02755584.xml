      Background:

      Cellular senescence is the aging of cells. It is a complex process that may be connected
      with aging and age-related diseases. It is unknown if these cells appear around wound sites
      in humans a few days after skin injury and if there are differences in young and old
      individuals. This study is being done to look at how cells in your body respond to small
      skin wounds. This information may help treat age-related diseases.

      Objective:

      To study how cells in the body respond to small skin wounds.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 20-39 or 70+

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood sample. They
      will fast before the screening visit. Women will have a urine pregnancy test.

      Participants will have 3 study visits over about 3 weeks.

      Visits 1 and 2: Participants will fast before and have blood taken. Women will have a urine
      test. All participants will have 2 skin biopsies. A spot on the upper arm will be numbed.
      Two small pieces of skin will be removed. They will keep the area covered until the next
      visit.

      Visit 3: Participants will have their vital signs taken. Their biopsy wounds will be
      measured and photographed.

      Objectives and Specific Aims: The objective of this proof-of-concept study is to understand
      the physiological role of senescent cells in humans during the aging process using a model
      of wound healing. Cellular senescence is the phenomenon by which normal cells cease to
      divide in response to a stress. We aim to determine if in healthy humans: (1) senescent
      cells appear around wound sites a few days after skin injury; (2) the number of senescent
      cells induced by skin injury increases with age; (3) the wound healing process, as
      determined by the size of the healed wounds, is altered with aging; (4) biomarkers of
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) increase significantly in the tissue around
      the wound a few days after skin injury, and the magnitude of increase is higher in older
      compared to younger persons. We also want to describe changes that occur with aging in DNA
      methylation and histone acetylation, gene expression, and protein expression within
      senescent cells in comparison to normal tissue.

      Experimental Design and Methods: Twenty healthy participants, ten between the age of 20-39
      years and ten 70 years old or older will be recruited for this pilot study. Of the ten
      participants in each age group, five will be men and five will be women. Each participant
      will have two 3mm skin biopsies on the inner upper arm during baseline visit (visit 1) and
      two 6mm skin biopsies concentric to the previous site during Visit 2. Visit 2 will be
      scheduled on 5 different days (day 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13) after the baseline visit with one man
      and one woman from each age group for each of the days. The size of the healed wounds will
      be documented during visit 3 (4-6 days after visit 2) by taking photographs of the wound
      with a millimeter (mm) tape measure placed next to the wound. Senescent cells will be
      visualized by confocal microscopy based on a number of senescent markers described in the
      literature. Senescent biomarkers will be measured in the tissue and systemically at baseline
      and follow-up.

      Medical Relevance and Expected Outcome: Cellular senescence is a complex process
      characterized by arrest in replication that is thought to be intrinsically connected with
      aging and age-related diseases. Recently, researchers have suggested that senescent cells
      may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its associated complications.
      Therefore, understanding the physiological role of senescent cells is critically important
      for understanding aging and age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Preclinical data
      have shown that senescent cells were inducible during cutaneous wound healing. Therefore,
      this method can be used to quantify senescent cell response after a standard stimulus and to
      verify whether the magnitude of senescence response correlate with aging. In the future this
      method could be used to test interventions that can modify the senescence response, and may
      be an invaluable method for assessing novel treatments of type 2 diabetes involving
      senescent cells.
