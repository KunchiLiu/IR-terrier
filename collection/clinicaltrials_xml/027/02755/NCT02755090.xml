  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site, double-blinded, randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial of
      inhaled nitrous oxide with oxygen (N2O/O2) versus intravenous (IV) sedation, with fentanyl
      and midazolam, for pain management in adult women having a pregnancy termination procedure
      between 12 and 16 weeks gestational age.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether nitrous oxide is a feasible and acceptable alternative to
      IV sedation for pain management during early second trimester D&amp;E. Primary endpoints will
      include maximum procedural pain using the visual analog scale (VAS) as well as satisfaction
      with anesthesia using the Iowa Satisfaction with Anesthesia Scale.

    <description>Participants in the nitrous oxide group will receive a scented face mask through which nitrous oxide will be administered. The nitrous content of the gas will be titrated up by 20% every 5 breaths with a goal of 70% N2O/ 30% O2 as tolerated by the participant. This group will also receive saline through an IV. All participants will receive local anesthesia in the form of a paracervical block and ibuprofen pre-operatively.</description>

    <description>Within the IV sedation group, women will receive 100mcg fentanyl and 2mg midazolam at least two minutes prior to initiation of the procedure. This group will also receive 100% oxygen by a scented face mask. All participants will receive local anesthesia in the form of a paracervical block and ibuprofen pre-operatively.</description>
