  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy
      (carboplatin and gemcitabine) is safe and effective in treating patients with metastatic
      triple negative breast cancer.

      Pembrolizumab is a drug which may help the immune system to target and destroy cancer cells.
      Pembrolizumab has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced melanoma and
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. However, it has not been approved as a treatment for
      breast cancer.
