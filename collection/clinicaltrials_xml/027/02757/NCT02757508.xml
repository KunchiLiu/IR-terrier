      This study is to gather information on school feeding programs and to measure the effect on
      linear growth and cognitive performance when providing a high-quality milk protein source or
      a combination of a high-quality milk protein source and rice proteins as a nutritional
      supplement to school children in Ghana. Children will receive a meal with a protein powder
      supplement with vitamins and minerals mixed into it. Participation is expected to last for 9
      months.

      1200 Children aged 6-7 years attending school will be enrolled throughout twenty primary
      schools (60 per school). Participants will be randomized to one of four groups: Control:
      Vitamins/minerals-200 mg premix contain the required micronutrients as per UNICEF
      recommendations.

      For groups 1-3 the same vitamin/mineral mix will be used along with Group 1.
      Vitamins/minerals + Milk Protein (8.75 g)-the milk protein is a skim milk powder with the
      sugar lactose.

      Group 2. Vitamins/minerals + Milk/plant Protein (8.75g)-the milk protein is a skim milk
      protein powder and the plant protein is a rice protein concentrate and the sugar lactose.

      Group 3. Vitamins/minerals + Milk Protein (4.38g)-the milk protein is a skim milk protein
      powder with the sugar lactose.

      At baseline measurements-weight,height,mid-upper arm circumference,and body composition will
      be taken, fasting blood spot test will be administered to measure levels of Insulin and
      insulin like growth factor, and computer based cognitive testing. Demographic information
      will be collected along with a dietary survey. Primary outcomes are cognitive performance on
      standardized tests and change in height-for-age z-score over the supplementation period, 9
      months total. Questionnaires will be administered to collect demographic data and dietary
      information.

      At the mid-point all measurements will be taken again and cognitive testing will be
      repeated.

      At the end of the study all measurements will be taken again, cognitive testing repeated,
      blood spot samples taken again, and a short survey will be administered about the protein
      powders.

    <description>Five tests created by Cambridge Cognition (CANTAB) will be selected and administered at enrollment, halfway through the intervention, and at the end of the intervention. The tests will examine visual memory pattern, recognition memory, test comprehension, rule acquisition, and attention set shifting. These tests will be administered on a Windows tablet by trained research staff. The participants will start by taking a practice test to get use to using the tablet and test format.</description>
