      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mirabegron
      versus placebo in men with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms while taking tamsulosin
      hydrochloride for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia
      (BPH).

      At Screening (Visit 1), subjects will enter into a 4-week open label tamsulosin
      hydrochloride 0.4 mg QD run-in period prior to being randomized into the 12-week
      double-blind treatment period (Visit 2). At conclusion of the 4-week tamsulosin
      hydrochloride run-in period, subjects will complete a 3-day diary just prior to Baseline
      (Visit 2). Approximately 7 days prior to Visit 2 subjects will receive a phone call
      reminding them about the diary and to answer any questions.

      If subjects meet all entry criteria at the end of the tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in
      period, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (mirabegron or placebo) for
      12 weeks of treatment in addition to the continuation of tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg QD.
      Those subjects randomized to mirabegron will start at 25 mg and will increase to 50 mg after
      4 weeks. Those subjects randomized to placebo will start blinded product matched to the
      mirabegron 25 mg tablet and will increase to blinded product matched to 50 mirabegron after
      4 weeks. Once a subject has increased dose, the subject will remain on that dose for the
      remainder of the study unless for safety reasons is required to discontinue study drug.

      A training diary will be completed in the first 2 weeks of the tamsulosin hydrochloride
      run-in period. During this evaluation period at least one telephone contact will take place
      with the subject. Diaries will be completed at home, using the electronic patient-reported
      outcome (ePRO) device, for 3 consecutive days prior to each visit: Baseline (Visit 2), Week
      4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). Site staff will
      contact the subject approximately 7 days prior to the scheduled visit to remind the subject
      to complete the electronic diary, review completion instruction and review changes to
      concomitant medications and adverse events (if applicable).

      Three days before Visits 2 (Baseline), 3 (Week 4), 4 (Week 8), and 5 (Week 12), subjects
      will complete a 3-day diary, using the ePRO device in which the subject will record
      micturition frequency, urgency (PPIUS), incontinence and volume voided. In addition, the
      diary will capture morning and evening blood pressure and pulse rate measurements via Home
      Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM). At Visit 1, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)
      will be completed. At Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5, subjects will complete the IPSS, EQ-5D-5L,
      OAB-q, PPBC, and TS-VAS. Maximum urinary flow (Qmax) will be measured at Visit 1
      (Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in) and Visit 5 (Week 12/End of Treatment).
      Post-void residual volume (PVR) will be assessed at Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride
      run-in (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2) and at Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week
      12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). A follow-up phone call (Visit 6) will be conducted 4-weeks
      after End of Treatment (Visit 5). Total study participation is approximately 20 weeks.
