    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot randomized wait-list controlled trial is to test the efficacy of
      an online cognitive behavioral pain management website called Proactive Self-Management
      Program for Effects of Cancer Treatment (PROPSECT) to reduce worst pain intensity for
      individuals with chronic painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and to
      explore the mediating effect of PROSPECT-induced changes in anxiety, fatigue, depression,
      and sleep disturbance on worst pain intensity. Another aim of this study is to determine
      whether PROSPECT will decrease CIPN symptom severity (e.g. non-painful numbness and
      tingling), average pain severity, and physical impairment. Lastly, since this intervention
      has never been tested in individuals with painful CIPN, the investigators will assess
      patients' perceptions of acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. over 25 years of age

          2. self-report 4/10 worst CIPN pain (Dworkin et al., 2011) that has persisted three
             months or longer after the cessation of their neurotoxic chemotherapy regimen

          3. have at least grade one sensory CIPN as defined by their oncology provider using the
             National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE)
             (National Cancer Institute, 2010)

          4. have a stable analgesic medication regimen as evidenced by a less than 10% increase
             or decrease in their analgesic medication dosage in the two weeks leading up to their
             enrollment in the study

          5. have internet access

          6. self-report the ability to use a computer

          7. signed informed consent

          8. willingness to participate in all study activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. prognosis of less than three months

          2. documented peripheral neuropathy due to other causes (diabetes, alcohol abuse, CNS
             malignancy, vitamin B deficiency, hereditary, nerve compression injury)

          3. neurotoxic chemotherapy treatment regimens are planned to occur while enrolled in the
             study

          4. have participated in cognitive behavioral pain management in the past or plan to
             enroll in cognitive behavioral pain management during the course of the intervention.
