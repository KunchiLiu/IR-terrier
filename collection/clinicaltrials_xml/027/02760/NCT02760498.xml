    <textblock>
      To estimate the clinical benefit of REGN2810 monotherapy for patients with metastatic (nodal
      or distant) cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) (Group 1) or with unresectable locally
      advanced CSCC (Group 2), as measured by overall response rate (ORR), according to central
      review.

      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 1 measurable lesion

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1

          -  Adequate bone marrow function

          -  Adequate renal function

          -  Adequate hepatic function

          -  Archived or newly obtained tumor material

          -  Patients must consent to undergo biopsies of externally visible CSCC lesions (Group 2
             only)

          -  Surgical or radiological treatment of lesions contraindicated

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk
             for immune-related adverse events

          -  Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the PD-1/PD-L1pathway

          -  Prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor

          -  Prior treatment with other immune-modulating agents within fewer than 4 weeks prior
             to the first dose of REGN2810, or associated with immune-mediated adverse events that
             were ≥ grade 1 within 90 days prior to the first dose of REGN2810, or associated with
             toxicity that resulted in discontinuation of the immune-modulating agent. Examples of
             immune-modulating agents include therapeutic vaccines, cytokine treatments, or agents
             that target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), 4-1BB (CD137), or OX-40.

          -  Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active

          -  Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within
             4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810

          -  Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or chronic/active infection
             with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus

          -  History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years

          -  Allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to antibody
             treatments

          -  Known allergy to doxycycline or tetracycline

          -  Patients with a history of solid organ transplant

          -  Any medical co-morbidity, physical examination finding, or metabolic dysfunction, or
             clinical laboratory abnormality that renders the patient unsuitable

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
