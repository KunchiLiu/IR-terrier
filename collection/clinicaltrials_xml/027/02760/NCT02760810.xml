      This is an 8-visit, bilateral, dispensing clinical study to evaluate the change in tear
      fluid pH and tear film osmolarity in an FDA-cleared contact lens in new contact lens users
      over a 14-day period.

    <measure>Tear pH</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Tear PH will be assessed using a micro-combination pH probe (Thermo Scientific Orion Micro pH electrode) . The data will be collected at baseline and at 14 days post contact lens wear. Tear pH will be collected in 1 eye. The data will be collected from the same subject eye throughout the duration of the study. A change from baseline post 14 days of contact lens wear will be reported</description>

    <measure>Osmolarity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Osmolarity will be assessed using the TearLab Osmolarity System. The data will be collected at baseline and at 14 days post contact lens wear. Osmolarity will be collected in 1 eye. The data will be collected from the same subject eye throughout the duration of the study. A change from baseline post 14 days of contact lens wear will be reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Tear PH will be assessed using a micro-combination pH probe (Thermo Scientific Orion Micro pH electrode) . The data will be collected at baseline and at 7 days post contact lens wear. Tear pH will be collected in 1 eye. The data will be collected from the same subject eye throughout the duration of the study. A change from baseline post 7 days of contact lens wear will be reported.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          3. The subject must be between 18 and 45 years of age.

          4. The subject must have a valid spectacle prescription with expiration date not over 1
             year.

          5. The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in
             the range of -0.25 Diopters (D) to -6.00 D in each eye.

          6. The subject's refractive cylinder must be â‰¤1.00 Cylindrical Diopter (DC) in each eye.

          7. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of logMAR 0.20 or better in each
             eye.

          8. Subjects should own a wearable pair of spectacles and agree to wear them the day of
             the initial visit and every morning on subsequent visit days.

          9. The subject must be a contact lens neophyte, defined as never having been dispensed
             contact lenses, or who has taken part in a non-dispensing clinical study or has been
             fitted with contact lenses in practice but never went on to actually wear the lenses.

         10. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e. no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will
             be discontinued).

          2. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          3. Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          4. Use of any medication with known tear film effects within 2 weeks prior to and during
             the study.

          5. Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion..

          6. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g. radial keratotomy,
             photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK),
             etc.)

          7. Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g. edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g. past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          8. Any ocular infection.

          9. Any infectious disease (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV) by self-report.

         10. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

         11. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 7 days
             prior to study enrollment.

         12. Employee of investigational clinic (e.g. Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).
