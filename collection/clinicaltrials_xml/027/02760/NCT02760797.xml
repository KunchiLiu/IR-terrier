  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and therapeutic activity of emactuzumab and RO7009789 administered in
      combination in participants with advanced solid tumors. This study will be conducted in two
      parts: dose escalation stage (Part 1) and an expansion stage (Part 2).
