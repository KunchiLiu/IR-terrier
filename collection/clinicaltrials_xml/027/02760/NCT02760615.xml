      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a step-wise approach the disease drug-drug
      interaction (DDI) potential for vedolizumab to indirectly affect the exposure of cytochrome
      P-450 (CYP) substrate drugs by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines in participants with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who are treated with vedolizumab.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab, which is being tested to assess
      the possibility of drug-drug interactions when administered with other medications.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts.

      Part 1 will enroll approximately 40 participants: 20 healthy participants and 20
      participants with UC or CD who are not currently being treated with vedolizumab. All
      participants will receive the following medications:

        -  Caffeine 100 mg

        -  Losartan 50 mg

        -  Omeprazole 20 mg

        -  Dextromethorphan 30 mg

        -  Midazolam 2 mg

      Part 2 will enroll approximately 20 participants on established vedolizumab intravenous (IV)
      maintenance treatment of 300 mg once every 8 weeks for the treatment of UC or CD.
      Participants will receive the same medications and dosages as in Part 1 in addition to their
      scheduled vedolizumab 300 mg IV.

      For Part 1 Subjects will be kept in the study unit from Check-in (Day -1) through at least
      24 hours after dosing for safety and for each subject in Part 1 of this study will be
      approximately 6 weeks, including Screening. for each subject in Part 1 of this study will be
      approximately 6 weeks, including Screening. For Part 2 Subjects will be kept in the study
      unit from Check-in (Day -1) through at least 24 hours after dosing for safety and PK
      assessments before discharge. The total confinement period will be 3 days. The total
      duration for each subject in Part 2 of this study will be approximately 12 weeks, including
      Screening.
