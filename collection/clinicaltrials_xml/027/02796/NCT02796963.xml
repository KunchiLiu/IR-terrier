  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this stepped wedge randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a crowdsourced intervention on promoting HIV testing among young Chinese
      men who have sex with men (MSM). The crowdsourced intervention will include an open contest,
      judging to determine finalists and prizes, a designathon, and contest-based MSM engagement.
      The hypothesis is that a crowdsourced intervention will be superior to conventional HIV test
      uptake campaigns in eliciting HIV test uptake.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use an adaptation of the stepped wedge randomized controlled trial design. A
      total of eight major metropolitan cities will implement the crowdsourced intervention. These
      cities will be chosen based on the following criteria: 1) previous CDC MSM sentinel
      surveillance site; 2) capacity for campaign implementation; 3) capacity for intervention
      implementation at community level. Four cities will implement more intensive in-person
      events to promote engagement (Guangzhou, Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, Qingdao, and Jinan
      in Shandong Province) during survey intervention stage. The RCT will be evaluated using two
      different sources of data: 1) online survey data from MSM in the eight cities prior to and
      after the intervention; 2) CDC routine surveillance data in the eight cities prior to and
      after the intervention.
