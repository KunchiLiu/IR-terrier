      The primary objective of this study is to assess the relationship between rhinovirus
      specific T-cell immunity and the human host response to primary rhinovirus challenge and
      subsequent secondary challenge with either homologous or heterologous rhinovirus serotypes.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the relationship between rhinovirus
      specific T-cell immunity and the human host response to primary rhinovirus challenge and
      subsequent secondary challenge with either homologous or heterologous rhinovirus serotypes.
      The overall hypothesis that will be addressed by the mechanistic studies in this proposal is
      that T helper and Tfh cells directed against conserved RV epitopes expand upon RV exposure
      and some of these cells persist as stable cross-reactive memory populations capable of
      displaying lineage-specific protective functions upon re-infection with related or unrelated
      strains of RV. The human specimens collected in this study will be analyzed with a variety
      of state-of-the-art techniques to provide an in depth description of T-cell responses to
      rhinovirus infection, and the correlation of these responses with viral infection, antibody
      responses, and illness. Beyond this objective, by using a systems biology approach, we aim
      to gain new insight into the role of diverse cell types involved in adaptive immunity to
      rhinovirus.
