      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, 5-period incomplete unbalanced crossover,
      placebo and active comparator (open-label) controlled, multicenter clinical trial to assess
      the efficacy and safety of three doses of formoterol fumarate (6 μg, 12 μg and 24 μg) BID
      administered via Pressair® compared to placebo and to open-label formoterol fumarate (20 μg
      BID and 40 μg single dose) administered as an inhalation solution via a standard jet
      nebulizer (with a mouthpiece) connected to an air compressor (Perforomist® Inhalation
      Solution). The drug product is an inhalation powder comprising of micronized aclidinium
      bromide and micronized formoterol fumarate with α-lactose monohydrate as the carrier,
      presented in a breathactuated device-metered dry-powder inhaler (DPI). It has been approved
      under the trademarks of Genuair® and/or Pressair® in some territories.

             prohibited medication.

          -  Patients unable to give consent, or patients of consenting age but under
             guardianship, or vulnerable patients.

             be unsuitable for the study.
