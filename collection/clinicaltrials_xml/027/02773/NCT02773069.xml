  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed Church Bridge intervention project will provide an innovative, evidence-based
      and technology supported, health intervention model for Southern, African American, and
      rural populations who continue to be disparately burdened by obesity and associated
      co-morbidities (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease). By targeting young
      adults (21-50 years of age) with families, the project will contribute to the long-term
      reduction of preventable chronic disease and related health care costs for the public.
