  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study will enroll 36 healthy
      volunteers to receive 1 of 3 regimens of PfSPZ or placebo, randomized 3:1. They will also
      receive suppressive doses of chloroquine (CQ). 10 weeks post 3rd immunization (and 4 weeks
      after last dose of CQ) subjects will be subjected to controlled human malarial infection.
      The primary objective of this study is to 1) evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge administered by DVI on Days 3, 10, and 17 to
      healthy malaria-naïve adults taking suppressive doses of CQ.

      This phase I, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study will
      randomize 36 healthy adult participants to one of three cohorts. The first 12 subjects will
      be randomized to receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine at a dose of 51,200 sporozoites or normal
      saline placebo. The next 12 subjects will be randomized to receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine
      at a dose of 102,400 sporozoites or placebo. The last 12 subjects will be randomized to
      receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine at a dose of 204,800 sporozoites or placebo. Within each
      group, placebo will be assigned 1:3, with blinded allocation to the two treatments within
      each dose-escalation group. All subjects will be immunized via the DVI route at 3, 10, and
      17 days from chloroquine initiation. All subjects will receive, by directly observed
      treatment, oral chloroquine (CQ) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 at a suppressive dose of 600 mg
      base on Day 1 and 300 mg base on Days 8, 15 and 22. At 10 weeks after the third
      administration of study vaccine or placebo, all subjects will receive PfSPZ Challenge by
      direct venous injection at a dose of 3,200 P. falciparum sporozoites to assess vaccine
      efficacy against controlled human malarial infection. Participants will receive a telephone
      follow-up six and twelve months thereafter. Malarone® will be offered as terminal treatment
      for all volunteers who do not sustain malaria by Day 28 and as first line therapy in the
      event of volunteer withdrawal from the study prior to onset of a clinical malaria episode.
      The primary objective of this study is to 1) evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge administered by DVI on Days 3, 10, and 17 to
      healthy malaria-naïve adults taking suppressive doses of CQ.

        for HIV 1/2*. *If the ELISA is positive, HIV confirmation should be performed. If the HIV
        Western Blot is not consistent with HIV infection, the volunteer may be enrolled. A past
        subject in an HIV vaccine trial who has a positive antibody ELISA may participate if the
        Western Blot is not consistent with pending seroconversion or positive or an HIV PCR assay

        glucose, hemoglobin). Any Grade 1 or higher value for any screening test will exclude the
        subject from enrollment with the exception of hematuria &gt; / = 1 + detected during menses
        for females. In this situation, the test can be repeated if clinically warranted but is
        not considered an indicator of poor health status or increased risk and so is not a
        contraindication to enrollment. 29. Acute febrile illness (oral temperature &gt; / = 38
        degrees C [100.4 degrees F]) or other acute illness within 3 days prior to vaccination

        ventricular hypertrophy; any non-sinus rhythm excluding isolated premature atrial or
        ventricular contractions; right or left bundle branch block; QT/QTc interval &gt; 450 ms; or
        advanced (secondary or tertiary) A-V heart block. 31. Has a history of psoriasis or
        porphyria. 32. Has a known allergy to chloroquine, 4-aminoquinoline derivatives,

        medication that is cross-reactive with CQ or atovaquone and proguanil, such as cimetidine
        or metoclopramide, during the study period. *Antacids and kaolin can be administered at
        least 4 hours from intake of chloroquine. 34. History of retinal or visual field changes,
        clinically significant auditory damage, or G6PD deficiency. 35. Has known sickle cell
        trait or other hemoglobinopathy or laboratory evidence of sickle cell trait by hemoglobin

        and the end of the study. 37. Known hypersensitivity to PfSPZ or its components. 38. Has
        any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the subject at an
        unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the
