  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous multi-dose Phase I and Phase II clinical studies have demonstrated that Instiladrin
      is a safe and effective treatment for BCG-refractory and recurrent NMIBC. This Phase III
      study is designed to expand those observations using a high dose of Instiladrin in patients
      that are &quot;BCG Unresponsive&quot; which refers to patients with high grade NMIBC who are unlikely
      to benefit from and should not receive further intravesical BCG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recombinant IFN alpha2b has pleiotropic effects that contribute to antitumor activity in
      Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC). Instiladrin (rAd-IFN/Syn3) is a non-replicating
      adenovirus vector harboring the human IFN alpha2b gene. When combined with the excipient
      Syn3, intravesical administration of the rAd-IFN results in transduction of the virus into
      the epithelial cell lining in the bladder. The IFN alpha2b gene is incorporated into the
      cellular DNA resulting in the synthesis and expression of large amount of IFN alpha2b
      protein. Clinical studies have confirmed that IFN alpha2b protein can be measured in
      patients treated with Instiladrin within 24 hours after dosing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18 years or older at the time of consent

          3. Have, at entry, confirmed by a pathology report:

             Carcinoma in Situ (CIS) only; Ta/T1 high grade disease with concomitant CIS or Ta/T1
             high grade disease without concomitant CIS

          4. Are &quot;BCG Unresponsive&quot; which refers to patients with high grade NMIBC who are
             unlikely to benefit from and who will not receive further intravesical BCG. The term
             &quot;BCG unresponsive&quot; includes patients who did not respond to BCG treatment and have a
             persistent high grade recurrence within 12 months after BCG was initiated, and those
             who despite an initial complete response (CR) to BCG, relapse with high grade NMIBC
             within 12 months of their last intravesical treatment with BCG. The following
             criteria define the patients who may be included in the study:

               -  Have received at least 2 previous courses of BCG within a 12 month period -
                  defined as at least 5 of 6 induction BCG instillations and at least 2 out of 3
                  instillations of maintenance BCG, or at least two of six instillations of a
                  second induction course, where maintenance BCG is not given

                    -  Exception: those who have T1 high grade disease at first evaluation after
                       induction BCG alone (at least 5 of 6 doses) may qualify in the absence of
                       disease progression

               -  At the time of tumor recurrence, patients with CIS alone or high grade Ta/T1
                  with CIS should be within 12 months of last exposure to BCG and patients with
                  Ta/T1 without CIS should be within 6 months of last exposure to BCG

               -  No maximum limit to the amount of BCG administered

               -  All visible papillary tumors must be resected and those with persistent T1
                  disease on transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) should undergo an
                  additional re-TURBT within 14 to 60 days prior to beginning study treatment.
                  Obvious areas of CIS should also be fulgurated.

             within the prostatic urethra. Freedom from upper tract disease (if clinically
             indicated) as indicated by no evidence of upper tract tumor by either intravenous
             pyelogram, retrograde pyelogram, computed tomography (CT) scan with or without
             urogram, or MRI with or without urogram performed within 6 months of enrollment

          9. Patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance at low risk for progression,
             defined as Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) &lt; 10 ng/dL, Gleason score 6 and clinical
             stage tumor-1 (cT1) are permitted to be in the study at the discretion of the
             investigator (see exclusion criteria 10).

         10. Female patients of childbearing potential must use maximally effective birth control
             during the period of therapy, must be willing to use contraception for 1 month
             following the last study drug infusion and must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test upon entry into this study. Otherwise, female patients must be
             postmenopausal (no menstrual period for a minimum of 12 months) or surgically
             sterile. 'Maximally effective birth control' means that the patient, if sexually
             active, should be using a combination of two methods of birth control that are
             approved and recognized to be effective by Regulatory Agencies

         11. Male patients must be surgically sterile or willing to use a double barrier
             contraception method upon enrollment, during the course of the study, and for 1 month

             Also patients with genitourinary cancers other than urothelial cancer or prostate
             cancer that are under active surveillance are excluded (see inclusion criterion 9)

         11. Patients who cannot hold instillation for 1 hour

         12. Patients who cannot tolerate intravesical dosing or intravesical surgical
             manipulation

             exception of:

               -  cytotoxic agents (e.g. Mitomycin C, doxorubicin and epirubicin) when
                  administered as a single instillation immediately following a TURBT procedure
                  which is permitted up to 14 to 60 days prior to beginning study treatment

               -  previous intravesical BCG therapy, which can be given at least 5 weeks before
