      The DECADES trial seeks to determine the comparative effectiveness of specialist-centered
      management of anxiety and depression vs. an imbedded and automated psychology referral for
      all subjects who screen positive for anxiety or depression.

      SPECIFIC AIMS: Mental Health and Quality of Life in Children with Gastrointestinal Disorders
      Depression and anxiety are two of the most common and dangerous disorders in childhood and
      adolescence.1,2 Currently, a large proportion of children with these disorders remain
      unrecognized or untreated,3,4 resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality.5 The rates
      of depression and anxiety are significantly higher in children with chronic illnesses6,
      including gastrointestinal disorders,7,8 than in the general population. Furthermore,
      children with depression or anxiety are far more likely to have somatic complaints, and have
      greater utilization of subspecialty care, especially in gastroenterology.9,10 Functional
      gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic recurrent abdominal
      pain, and functional dyspepsia frequently have comorbid anxiety or depression.8

      Efforts to recognize and treat mental health problems in children with chronic medical
      illness, such as gastrointestinal disorders, have been shown to improve adherence to
      therapy, as well as other clinical outcomes.11 More importantly, improving such mental
      health problems might go far to addressing the outcomes patients care about most with
      respect to their gastroenterological disease. Unfortunately, mental health resources are
      often difficult for families to access, even when these disorders are recognized.

      Validated screening tools exist to screen for anxiety and depression in children and
      adolescents, including the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders
      (SCARED)12 and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).13 Despite the established
      importance of depression and anxiety in the gastrointestinal health of children and
      adolescents, few data exist describing the treatment of anxiety and depression by pediatric
      gastroenterologists. Furthermore, little is known about how families or patients view the
      subspecialty office as the setting to detect or care for mental illness. Additionally, if
      anxiety and depression are identified by the gastroenterologist, many practitioners find
      either they have limited training14 and expertise in the management of adolescent mental
      health disorders, or they encounter barriers to referral to a mental health specialist,
      especially in children with public insurance.15

      Therefore, the specific aims of this research project are to:

      Aim 1: Determine family and patient attitudes towards tools to screen for mental illness in
      a pediatric subspecialty office utilizing structured interviews.

      Sub Aim 1a: Determine patient and family attitudes toward anxiety and depression screening
      in a subspecialty office.

      Sub Aim 1b: Determine outcomes of importance to patients and families related to anxiety and
      depression in a pediatric subspecialty office.

      Aim 2: Develop an integrated approach that accounts for family and patient preferences as
      determined in Aim 1, to deliver anxiety and depression screening instruments to new and
      established patients in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic.

      Aim 3: Perform a pre-post comparative effectiveness trial comparing screening in a pediatric
      gastroenterological clinic with notification of the physician to screening in a pediatric
      gastroenterological clinic with the addition of a psychologist, with respect to the
      patient-centered outcomes identified in Aim 1.

      Completion of these aims will allow us to develop an integrated process to screen for
      depression and anxiety in a high-risk population. Furthermore, the knowledge gained from
      piloting depression and anxiety screening will help us to determine attitudes towards this
      approach in the pediatric subspecialty setting, which will maximize outcomes from the visit
      that are important to patients and their families.

      We hypothesize that a combined approach that screens for depression and anxiety within the
      gastroenterology clinic and also provides for access to a psychologist who is integrated
      with the clinic will lead to superior clinical and patient-centered outcomes. However we may
      find that screening patients and then alerting the gastroenterology provider may be
      sufficient to recognize and treat mental health disorders effectively. Comparing the
      effectiveness of these two strategies is therefore important and is the overall focus of
      this proposal.
