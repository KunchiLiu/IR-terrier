    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical efficacy of bismuth tripotassium
      dicitrate (De-Nol) in combination with pantoprazole versus pantoprazole monotherapy in
      subjects with NSAID-induced gastropathy in 14±2 days of treatment.

      This study has a screening period (up to 3±2 days duration). Randomization will be held in
      each stratum (H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative) on the Visit 1. Treatment period
      will consist of 2 visits: Visit 2 (up to 14±2 days after Visit 1) in subjects with
      completely healed ulcer(s) and erosions after control esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) and
      Visit 3 (up to 28±2 days after Visit 1) in subjects with not healed ulcers and erosions
      after control EGDS on Visit 2. The period of follow-up safety assessments will last 1 week
      after the end of the study treatment
