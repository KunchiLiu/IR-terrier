    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men in the Western world. Early
      detection of prostate cancer has been shown to decrease mortality, but has limitations with
      low specificity leading to unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis of low-risk cancers. The
      STHLM3 trial has paved the way for improved specificity in early detection of prostate
      cancer using the blood-based STHLM3 test for identifying men at increased risk of harbouring
      significant prostate cancer.

      Targeted prostate biopsies based on MRI images have been shown to increase sensitivity of
      high-grade cancers compared to the currently used systematic biopsies, but existing evidence
      are contradictory and not free from methodological flaws.

      The primary aim of STHLM3-MR/Fusion is to increase the specificity in early detection of
      prostate cancer without decreasing the sensitivity of aggressive prostate cancers by
      introducing targeted prostate biopsies and comparing to traditional prostate biopsies. The
      primary endpoints are the number of performed biopsies and the number of detected high-grade
      prostate cancers defined as Gleason 7 or higher. Secondary endpoints include the number of
      low risk prostate cancers diagnosed and the proportion of patients with up-or downgraded
      disease after assessment of prostatectomy specimen. Additional aims include to assess the
      health economic consequences of implementing MRI based prostate cancer diagnostics and to
      improve the quality and effectiveness of prostate cancer diagnosis in the routine health
      care in Stockholm.

      The STHLM3-MR/Fusion project will be performed in two separate phases, analyzed separately.
      Based on power calculations, approximately 500 planned for prostate biopsies will be
      included in the first phase. Men who have previously been diagnosed with prostate cancer may
      not take part in the study. The study period of Phase 1 is March 2016 to January 2017. The
      second phase will start in autumn 2016 and end by December 2017.
