  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, three-arm, randomized study in participants
      with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received
      at least two prior regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The study
      compares regorafenib, a standard of care therapy in this setting, to cobimetinib plus
      atezolizumab and atezolizumab monotherapy.
