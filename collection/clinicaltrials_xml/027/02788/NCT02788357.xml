    <textblock>
      This proposal evaluates the safety and effectiveness of a noradrenergic drug named
      atomoxetine combined with motor training to enhance cortical plasticity and improve hand
      function after stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive studies in laboratory animals and humans over the last ten years indicate that
      some medications, especially amphetamine, given with specific physical therapy may improve
      motor learning (and therefore recovery from stroke) more than physical therapy alone.
      However, the number of patients in clinical trials who have received physical therapy and
      amphetamine is very small, for two reasons: because amphetamine may interact with many other
      medications that stroke patients are already taking, and because its potential for addiction
      precludes its use on a daily basis. The investigators now wish to evaluate the effectiveness
      of a more selective medication, atomoxetine, known to have many fewer side effects and no
      potential for drug addiction. The proposed mechanism by which amphetamine enhances recovery
      is by increasing central levels of norepinephrine. While the investigators already know that
      this drug is more selective than amphetamine, the investigators would like to evaluate its
      effects on hand motor learning and motor recovery in chronic stroke patients in a clinical
      setting.
