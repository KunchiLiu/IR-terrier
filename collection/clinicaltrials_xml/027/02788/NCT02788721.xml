    <textblock>
      The study is a First-in-Human, Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      evaluating single and multiple ascending oral doses of GLPG2451 and combined multiple doses
      of GLPG2451 and GLPG2222 in healthy subjects. The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety
      and tolerability after single ascending oral doses and of multiple doses of GLPG2451 given
      to healthy subjects compared to placebo as well as of multiple doses of the combination of
      GLPG2451/GLPG2222 compared to GLPG2451/placebo.
