    <description>The status of each embryo will be assessed by an independent panel of 5 embryologists through visual inspection using the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) criteria to determine if each embryo has achieved the blastocyst stage of development or not.</description>

    <description>This is a non-interventional study in which embryo selection is performed according to standard of care. The Diafert output, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) concentration in follicular fluid (FF), will be recorded but will not be used in patient management, ie, values will not be used for embryo selection in the assisted reproduction procedure.</description>
