    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety/tolerability of the 2 different vaccine
      regimens of priming with trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV and boosting with trivalent Ad26.Mos.HIV and
      Clade C gp140 plus adjuvant or priming with tetravalent Ad26.Mos4.HIV and boosting with
      Ad26.Mos4.HIV and Clade C glycoprotein (gp)140 plus adjuvant. Immune responses of the
      different vaccine schedules will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at screening

          -  Is healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, electrocardiogram
             (ECG), and vital signs measurement performed at screening

          -  Are willing/able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in the
             protocol and study procedures

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test (beta human chorionic gonadotropin [beta hCG]) at the Screening visit, and a
             negative urine pregnancy test pre-dose on Day 1

          -  Are assessed by the clinic staff as being at low risk for HIV infection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has chronic hepatitis B (measured by hepatitis B surface antigen test) or active
             hepatitis C (measured by hepatitis C virus [HCV] Ab test; if positive, HCV
             ribonucleic acid [RNA] PCR test will be used to confirm active versus past HCV
             infection), active syphilis infection, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas . Active
             syphilis documented by serology unless positive serology is due to past treated
             infection

          -  Has had a thyroidectomy or active thyroid disease requiring medication during the
             last 12 months (not excluded: a stable thyroid supplementation)

          -  Has had major psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse problems during the past 12
             months (including hospitalization or periods of work disability) that in the opinion
             of the investigator would preclude participation

          -  Has been in receipt of any licensed vaccine within 14 days prior to the first dose of
             study vaccine/placebo, plans to receive within 14 days after the first study
             vaccination, or plans to receive within 14 days before or after the second, third or
             fourth vaccination

          -  Is a recipient of a prophylactic or therapeutic HIV vaccine candidate at any time, or
             a recipient of other experimental vaccine(s) within the last 12 months. For
             participants who received an experimental vaccine (except HIV vaccine) more than 12
             months ago, documentation of the identity of the experimental vaccine must be
             provided to the sponsor, who will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis
