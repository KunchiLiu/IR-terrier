  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identifying biomarkers to predict the clinical course and benefits of therapy early in the
      course of the disease remains one of the most urgent and relevant challenges to improve
      overall patient management, to prevent treatment delay or overtreatment. This study is
      conducted to examine the effect of nintedanib treatment on change in biomarkers indicative
      of extracellular matrix turnover which have been shown recently to correlate with disease
      progression. This study further aims to confirm the association of biomarker course during
      the first three months of treatment and disease progression.
