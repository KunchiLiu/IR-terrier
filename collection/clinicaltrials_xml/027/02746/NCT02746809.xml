      The study objectives are to assess the safety and efficacy of the CoreValve Evolut 34R
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) system in patients with severe symptomatic
      aortic stenosis who are considered at high or extreme risk for surgical aortic valve
      replacement.

             area index of &lt; 0.6 cm2/m2) by the continuity equation, AND mean gradient &gt; 40 mmHg
             or maximal aortic valve velocity &gt; 4.0 m/sec by resting echocardiogram.

             Subjects with low-flow/low gradient severe aortic stenosis can be included, provided
             low-dose dobutamine or exercise stress echocardiography demonstrates a mean gradient
             of &gt; 40 mmHg or a maximal aortic valve velocity of &gt; 4.0 m/sec, AND aortic valve area
             of &lt; 1.0 cm2 (or aortic valve area index of &lt; 0.6 cm2/m2).

          2. STS score of ≥ 8 OR documented heart team agreement of ≥ high risk for AVR due to
             frailty or co-morbidities.

          3. Symptoms of aortic stenosis, AND NYHA Functional Class II or greater.

          4. The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all
             required post-procedure follow-up visits.

             Exclusion Criteria:

          5. Any condition considered a contraindication for placement of a bioprosthetic valve
