    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study of INCB059872 in subjects with
      advanced malignancies. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 (dose escalation) will
      determine the recommended dose(s) of INCB059872 for dose expansion, based on maximum
      tolerated dose and/or a tolerated pharmacologically active dose. Part 2 (dose expansion)
      will further determine the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD of the selected
      dose(s).
