  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to detect serum metabolite changes, as well as other health indicators with
      the intervention of air purifiers on a randomized, crossover, double-blind trial.

    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a randomized double-blind crossover trial among 60 healthy
      college students in Shanghai, China from November to December, 2015. These students lived in
      dormitories that were randomized into two groups and alternated the use of true or sham air
      purifiers for 9 consecutive days with a 2-week wash-out interval. All participants and
      research staffs were blinded to the group assignment. All participants were required to stay
      in their dormitory with the windows/doors closed for at least 50% of the time on weekdays
      and for 80% on weekends throughout the 9-day intervention period. All interventions started
      at 7 a.m. to avoid issues related to diurnal variation. Health endpoints, including blood
      pressure, fractional exhaled nitric oxide were evaluated and biological samples such as
      morning urine, fast blood and buccal cells were collected at baseline and immediately after
      the completion of each intervention period.

    <description>The 17 dormitory rooms and their residents were randomized into two groups: the intervention and control group. The intervention group went through a 9-day intervention with an air purifier placed in the center of the room. All rooms in this group used the same qualified air purifiers (model KJEA200e, 3M), and all participants were required to stay in their dormitory rooms with the windows/doors closed throughout intervention period. All participants and research staffs were blinded to the group assignment.</description>
