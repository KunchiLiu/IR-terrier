  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of hepatitis A antibodies,
      approximately 8 years and 10 years post vaccination with the complete series of Havrix (2
      doses) and the partial series completion (1 dose).

      The study comprises of two independent cross-sectional surveys (Year 8 and Year 10). The
      first cross-sectional serosurvey will evaluate the long term persistence of immunity
      approximately 8 years post vaccine administration and the second cross-sectional study will
      evaluate long term persistence, approximately 10 years post vaccine administration.
