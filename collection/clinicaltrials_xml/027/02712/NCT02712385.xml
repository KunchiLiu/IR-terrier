      BACKGROUND - Approximately 1,700 transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) occur annually in NI
      with TIA survivors often being left with considerable functional impairment. TIA and strokes
      share common risk factors with cardiovascular disease. Cardiac rehabilitation
      post-myocardial infarction has shown significant reductions in morbidity and mortality, with
      home-based programmes producing better adherence and similar outcomes to hospital-and
      community-based programmes. However, the value of rehabilitation programmes for stroke
      prevention following a TIA or minor stroke is unclear.

      AIMS - to determine if a novel rehabilitation programme, 'The Healthy Brain Manual', for
      TIA/minor stroke patients can be developed, using MRC guidelines for developing complex
      health service interventions, from an approved home-based cardiac rehabilitation programme
      (the 'Heart Manual') and to pilot a 12-week trial of the novel programme.

      METHODS-All patients attending a TIA clinic in Belfast within 4 weeks of their first
      TIA/mild stroke will be invited to participate. The novel home-based programme manual will
      be developed following systematic reviews of the literature and qualitative exploration with
      the target population, using focus groups. A feasibility study will then be developed into a
      pilot trial. The pilot trial will recruit to 3 different treatments: (1)standard care;
      (2)standard care plus the manual; (3)standard care, manual plus a pedometer (to further
      promote physical activity). Interviews and focus groups will be employed to assess the
      interventions' acceptability. The intervention, 'The Healthy Brain Manual' will be refined
      and modified at all stages of the research.

      CONCLUSIONS - The findings will inform the development of a novel secondary prevention
      programme, 'The Healthy Brain Manual', for TIA/minor stroke patients and of a trial to test
      its effectiveness and longer-term potential to improve outcomes for TIA/stroke patients.

      METHODS - The development of the novel home-based rehabilitation programme, adapted from the
      &quot;Heart Manual&quot;, will follow the guidelines of the MRC for developing complex health service
      interventions. The steps of the guidelines include: 1) exploring relevant theory; 2)
      modelling the preliminary intervention by selecting the main components based on the
      literature and qualitative research; 3) pilot-testing the preliminary intervention; 4)
      developing the definitive randomised controlled trial; and, 5) implementing and evaluating
      the randomised controlled trial over the long-term. This study focuses on the first three
      steps of the MRC framework.

      Exploration of relevant theory - Initially, literature relating to cardiac rehabilitation
      and secondary prevention of TIAs and minor stroke will be reviewed following searches in
      appropriate databases with input from a medical librarian. The research team (including the
      applicant, supervisors, collaborators and steering group) will discuss key findings and
      identify those deemed appropriate to the study setting, with identification of appropriate
      behaviour change theory using behaviour change taxonomy.

      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited from two TIA/ 'minor' stroke assessment units,
      based in Belfast, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Ulster Hospital. Patients are
      typically seen within one week of suffering neurological symptoms suggestive of TIA. After
      confirmation of diagnosis and initial management on the day of presentation, the attending
      physician will offer patients a study information sheet and an invitation to participate. If
      the patient agrees to being contacted, the researcher will telephone twenty-four hours later
      to invite them to attend the Clinical Research Facility, QUB to participate in the study and
      written, informed consent will be obtained. The numbers of those who decline to participate
      in the study will be recorded to provide information about recruitment rates.

      Developing the intervention: From those who agree to participate, an initial purposeful
      sample of patients will be invited to focus groups. Participants will be given the manual
      approximately a week before the focus group and asked to read it before attending the focus
      group. The topic guide for focus groups will be based on findings from the literature review
      and will include the formatting and lay-out of the manual, manual content and potential
      improvements to the manual. Health and social care staff involved in the clinical care of
      TIA and stroke patients, members of voluntary organisations, relatives and carers will also
      be invited to participate in a focus group: initial plans are that a sample of these
      individuals would be invited to a single group. Participants' and professionals' experiences
      of and attitudes towards key interventions identified from the literature will also be used
      in modelling the pilot intervention. With each participant's consent, interviews and focus
      groups will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Two researchers will then analyse the
      transcripts independently by: familiarisation; identifying a thematic framework; indexing;
      charting; and, mapping and interpretation.

      Feasibility and then pilot study of the intervention - Baseline assessment: Following
      analysis of the findings of the literature review and qualitative data, the home-based
      vascular rehabilitation manual will be developed, adapting the &quot;Heart Manual&quot; (now referred
      to as 'The Healthy Brain Manual') accordingly. This novel manual will then be piloted in a
      phase II clinical trial using the outcome measure of predicted VO2max. As described above,
      prospective trial participants will be invited to attend the Clinical Research Facility
      within 2 weeks of their initial TIA/'minor' stroke event, for initial assessment, at which
      their written consent to participate will be sought. Baseline assessments (taking
      approximately 60 minutes) will be completed prior to randomisation to ensure allocation
      concealment. All patients will initially undertake a submaximal exercise test under the
      supervision of a trained physician to exclude contra- indications to exercise and to provide
      a predicted VO2max. All will be given, with appropriate instructions, an Actigraph GT3x
      accelerometer to wear for one week to provide a blinded baseline physical activity
      assessment. Participants will be given stamped addressed envelopes to return the
      accelerometers by post to the applicant after one week.

      Randomisation: Block randomisation will be used and patients will be stratified, based on
      age, sex and diagnosis (TIA/'minor' stroke). Study group allocation will be revealed to
      participants only at the end of the baseline assessment and following completion of all
      initial measurements (except accelerometry).

      Interventions: The control group (Group 1) will follow standard care guidelines as per
      treatment protocols and provided by their healthcare professionals at the hospital clinic.
      Group 2 will receive the home-based 'The Healthy Brain Manual' as well as standard care
      (proposed duration six weeks); whilst Group 3 will additionally receive a pedometer as well
      as 'The Healthy Brain Manual' and standard care. 'The Healthy Brain Manual' programme will
      be explained to the Group 2 and 3 participants by the applicant at the end of the baseline
      assessment. The use of the pedometer, an approach to its use in goal setting and an
      accompanying diary will also be explained to Group 3 participants at that time. 'The Healthy
      Brain Manual' will address each of the modifiable vascular risk factors, managing one risk
      factor each week, whilst encouraging the patient to slowly increase their activity over the
      (proposed) six week programme in the setting of their home and addressing the issues of
      anxiety and depression following the diagnosis of TIA or 'minor' stroke. The manual
      therefore involves education and motivation of the patient to address these risk factors.
      The facilitator (the applicant and/or a stroke nurse) will also help them identify local
      support resources, for example smoking cessation services. 'The Healthy Brain Manual' will
      utilise the behaviour change techniques of goal setting, barrier identification, setting
      graded tasks, self monitoring, feedback, relapse prevention and stress management. Self-set
      pedometer targets will emerge during discussion with the applicant who will use simple
      motivational interviewing techniques and advise keeping a daily step-count diary. Telephone
      follow-up review, with the applicant, will take place at one and four weeks as per usual
      &quot;Heart Manual&quot; care as well as at eight weeks for all three groups, unless the findings of
      initial qualitative work would suggest that an alternative design of a follow-up plan would
      be appropriate. These reviews will include advice regarding addressing the modifiable
      vascular risk factors and, if appropriate, issues with the home-based vascular
      rehabilitation programme ('The Healthy Brain Manual') and pedometer targets.

      Review assessment: All participants will have a 3 month follow-up review appointment with a
      research nurse, who is kept blind to their random group allocation. This review should take
      approximately sixty minutes to complete: the nurse will administer questionnaires for
      self-completion and will repeat all baseline measurements except the submaximal exercise
      test (for assessment of predicted VO2max) which will be conducted by a trained physician.
      All participants will be asked to wear an Actigraph GT3x accelerometer again, for one week,
      to provide a post-intervention physical activity assessment and to return this by post in
      the same way as following their baseline assessment.

      End-of study qualitative assessment: At the end of the pilot study, all participants will be
      asked about their perceptions of the relevance, acceptability and value of the intervention,
      using questionnaires, focus groups and semi structured interviews.

      The manual will be developed at all stages of the research process as per the MRC
      guidelines.
