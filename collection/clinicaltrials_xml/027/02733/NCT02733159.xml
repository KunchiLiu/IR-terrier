  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine that pembrolizumab is safe and tolerable at the selected dose for
      the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in patients with a performance status of
      2. All patients will receive pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. There are several
      studies which demonstrate a role for the immune system in fighting lung cancer. However,
      there are multiple mechanisms by which cancer dampens this response. The PD-1
      receptor-ligand interaction is one of the major pathways hijacked by tumours to help evade
      detection and elimination by the cells of the immune system. A number of compounds which
      block this pathway, including the drug pembrolizumab, have shown impressive results in some
      patients.

      At present all of the trials with pembrolizumab reported thus far have been in patients with
      a good Performance Status of 0-1, a measure of daily activity. Unfortunately many patients
      with lung cancer have impaired performance status, making them ineligible for trials of new
      therapies including anti PD-1. Clinical trials of standard-of-care therapy have been
      successfully performed in the PS=2 only population demonstrating the feasibility of
      performing clinical trials in this population.

      In this trial, the investigators would like to determine whether this drug can be used to
      treat Performance status 2 patients with a lower general daily activity. The purpose of this
      trial is to determine that pembrolizumab is safe and tolerable. The investigators would also
      like to see how well the treatment works, find out more information about tumour shrinkage,
      and learn more about the disease and how it changes over time.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, a maximum of 2 years and 6 months after end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be recorded in relation to each cycle of treatment and graded according to CTCAE criteria. The incidence of each adverse event (all grades and grade 3/4) will be reported as a per-patient-cycle rate and as a per-patient rate. The toxicity co-primary outcome measure for the trial is defined as the occurrence of a treatment-related dose reduction or dose delay or treatment discontinuation due to toxicity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Response</measure>
    <time_frame>≥18 weeks, up to maximum of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will have CT scans every 9 weeks from baseline until disease progression. On each occasion, overall tumour burden will be assessed using RECIST version 1.1. The response co-primary outcome measure for the trial is defined as the occurrence of CR, PR or SD for 18 weeks or greater.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best objective response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>≥18 weeks, up to maximum of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Best objective response rate (ORR) will be calculated as the proportion of patients with CR or PR based on a denominator that includes all eligible patients that have received at least one cycle of treatment. Best objective response rate will be based on responses confirmed using the subsequent 9-weekly scan but best objective response rate based on unconfirmed responses will also be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health related quality of life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to a maximum of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the functional effect of a medical condition and/or its consequent treatment upon a patient. The purpose of HR QoL measurement is to quantify the degree to which the medical condition or its treatment impacts the individual's life in a valid and reproducible way.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>time to progression up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the time from registration into trial to the date of CT scan when progressive disease first recorded. Patients with no recorded progression at the time of analysis or who die without recorded progression will be censored at the date of the CT scan when they were last recorded with an evaluable measure that was not progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival time (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>progression-free survival time up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the time from registration into trial to the date of CT scan when progressive disease first recorded or date of death without previously recorded progression. Patients who are alive with no recorded progression at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of the CT scan when they were last recorded with an evaluable measure that was not progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival time (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>survival time up to 2 years or date of death</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as the time from registration into trial to the date of death. Patients who are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date last seen alive.</description>
