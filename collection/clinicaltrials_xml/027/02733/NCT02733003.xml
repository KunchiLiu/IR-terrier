    <textblock>
      This study seeks to implement the Women's Health CoOp (Cooperative) (WHC) intervention into
      HIV treatment centers (HCT), antenatal, and substance treatment clinics in South Africa to
      translate the evidence-based intervention into real-world settings. Implementation, service,
      and patient outcomes will be evaluated through an iterative stepped wedge design.

    <textblock>
      This five-year implementation science study is using cluster-randomized stepped-wedge design
      to evaluate the implementation, service, and patient outcomes associated with the WHC for
      432 alcohol and other drug (AOD)-using HIV+ women in usual care settings.

      Each implementation cycle will last 6 months, with a 3-month formative &quot;lesson learned&quot;
      evaluation. Subsequently, the investigators will collect post-intervention data from each
      cycle and these formative periods between cycles will be used to inform backward- and
      forward- implementation strategies, make modifications to the WHC, and leave time for
      site-specific training for the next cycle.

      A list of four treatment clinics and a list of four HCT/antenatal clinics, which have been
      identified and approved by the City of Cape Town, South Africa will be randomized to begin
      the intervention during one of the four cycles. Each site from its respective list will
      receive a random number between 1 and 4 indicating which cycle the site will have focus
      groups and receive training to implement the WHC. The lists will then be paired by their
      respective numbers where each pair of sites will be allocated an intervention training and
      implementation cycle. 120 participants will be recruited in each cycle (60 from each
      clinic).

      Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected to assess the appropriateness of
      marketing plans developed through formative methods, as well as the acceptability, adoption,
      feasibility, fidelity, penetration, sustainability of the intervention implementation, and
      service outcomes (comprehensive services and timely linkages).

      Implementation of the WHC in usual care settings has the potential to reach more vulnerable
      participants which could have a high public health impact if that implementation is shown to
      be effective and sustainable in these new settings.
