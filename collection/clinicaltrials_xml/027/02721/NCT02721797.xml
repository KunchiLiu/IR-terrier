  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is an inherited disease of collagen, found in connective
      tissues, such as skin. EDS patients suffer from joint and skin problems (skin
      hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility) along with a large range of other disorders,
      including, delayed wound healing with atrophic scarring, easy bruising, tissue fragility,
      gastrointestinal and gum problems. There are many different types of EDS, with different
      mechanisms of action, and not all of these are well understood. This study will used
      advanced microscopy techniques called atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM) to analyse the changes in collagen as a result of EDS, compared to normal
      collagen. These changes will be viewed at the micron and nanoscale level (between 1,000 to
      100,000 x magnification), and will focus on the differences in collagen construction through
      a process called cross-linking. These changes could potentially help clinicians understand
      the root cause of EDS symptoms, and provide a deeper knowledge of cross-linking disorders in
      collagen. Increasing our knowledge of how collagen is affected in EDS patients, may lead to
      improved treatment options for patients.
