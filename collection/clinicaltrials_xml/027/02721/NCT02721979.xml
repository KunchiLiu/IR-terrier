    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ARN-509 (androgen receptor antagonist ARN-509) works in
      treating patients with prostate cancer who are in active surveillance. Testosterone can
      cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using androgen receptor
      antagonist ARN-509 may fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of testosterone by the
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the negative repeat biopsy rate by site directed and systematic prostate biopsy
      after 90-days of ARN-509.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the rate of exit at 2 years from active surveillance due to pathologic
      reclassification.

      II. Determine the overall rate of exit at 2 years from active surveillance.

      III. Determine the rate of local treatment (e.g. radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy,
      brachytherapy) at 2 years and the local treatment free survival.

      IV. Determine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression rates and PSA progression free
      survival (PFS), as defined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria.

      V. Determine the rate of radiographic disappearance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      detectable prostate cancer following treatment (only in patients with a baseline nodule that
      is Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PIRADS] 3 or more and &gt; 5mm).

      VI. Investigate the safety of ARN-509 in men undergoing active surveillance; safety will be
      evaluated by the incidence, severity, duration, causality, seriousness, and type(s) of
      adverse events as assessed by the revised National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
      (NCI CTC), version 4.03 published 14 June 2010.

      VII. Track quality of life utilizing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate
      (FACT-P) and Short Form (SF)36 surveys for each cohort.

      VIII. Exploratory biomarker assessment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ARN-509 orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 90 days.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up at 180, 365, 545, and 730
      days.
