  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During penile prosthesis surgery, participants are given general anesthesia in combination
      with other pain drugs. A caudal nerve block (CNB) is a local anesthetic injected near the
      tailbone, in addition to general anesthesia, which can lower the need for pain drugs.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how effective CNBs are in participants
      who are having penile prosthesis surgery compared to participants who only have general
      anesthesia by studying how long participant stays in the hospital and the level of pain they
      have after surgery.

      Study Groups and CNB Administration:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be randomly
      assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. Participant will have an equal
      chance of being assigned to either group.

        -  If participant is assigned to Group 1, they will receive a CNB and general anesthesia
           during surgery.

        -  If participant is assigned to Group 2, they will only receive general anesthesia during
           surgery.

      Participant will not know to which group they have been assigned. The CNB will be given to
      participant while they are under general anesthesia. To receive a CNB, a special needle is
      inserted at the lower part of the back (near the tailbone). A type of local anesthesia is
      then injected into the sac surrounding the spinal cord that contains the nerves related to
      the penis.

      All participants will also receive general anesthesia as part of their standard care.
      Participant will also receive a separate consent form for the surgery that explains the
      procedure and its risks, including the risks for general anesthesia.

      After Surgery Data Collection:

      During the 24 hours after surgery, the study staff will ask participant to rate their pain
      on a scale of 0-10. Participant will be asked to rate their pain about every 30 minutes
      while they are in the hospital, but they may be asked to rate their pain more often if
      needed. It should take less than 5 minutes each time to rate participant's pain. Depending
      on how participant rates their pain, additional pain drugs may be given to them as part of
      their standard care.

      If participant is discharged from the hospital on the same day as their surgery or if they
      are discharged before a member of the staff can ask them to rate their pain, the study staff
      will call participant within 24 hours after they have been discharged from the hospital.
      This call should last about 5-10 minutes.

      The amount of pain drugs given to participant before, during, and after surgery will also be
      recorded.

      About 3 days after participant's surgery, the study staff will call them to ask about their
      pain, the amount of pain drugs they have taken, and how satisfied they are with the type of
      anesthesia and pain control they have received. This call should last about 5-10 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      Patient's participation in this study will be over after the phone call about 3 days after
      their surgery has been completed.

      This is an investigational study. The general anesthesia and CNB used in this study are FDA
      approved and commercially available. It is considered investigational to compare the
      effectiveness of CNBs in penile prosthesis surgery to general anesthesia alone. The study
      doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 104 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
