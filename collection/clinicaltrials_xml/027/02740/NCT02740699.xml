    <textblock>
      Background:

      Coronary artery disease causes plaque in arteries. This can cause stroke or heart disease.
      Drugs called statins might shrink plaque. Researchers want to study how CT scanning can
      determine if an individual s arterial plaque has decreased while taking statins.

      Objectives:

      To measure the change in coronary artery plaque volume in people treated with high-intensity
      statin therapy using CT and MRI scans. To study the metabolic activity of plaque in
      arteries. To determine how well plaque measurements from heart CT scans can be replicated.

      Eligibility:

      Men ages 45-75 and women ages 50-75 who are good candidates for statin treatment

      Design:

      Visit 1: participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Blood tests

        -  Heart MRI and CT scan: An IV inserted into an arm or hand vein removes blood and
           injects

      contrast, and medicine if needed. Participants lie on a table that slides into a machine
      that takes pictures of the body. For the CT scan, if their heart rate is too high, they get
      medicine to lower it. They breathe in a special way, holding their breath for 5 seconds.

      Participants will begin high-intensity statin treatment.

      Participants will have 7 more visits over 3 years. All visits include blood tests and
      medication review. Some may also include:

        -  Statin treatment adjustment

        -  CT scan

        -  MRI scan

        -  Physical exam

      Participants may join the PET Substudy. This includes 5 more visits during the study. These
      include:

        -  Getting an IV in an arm vein

        -  Blood tests

        -  PET scans: They fast 12 hours before.

      Participants may join the Reproducibility Substudy if they had a slow heart rate during
      their first CT scan. This includes 1 additional heart CT scan 4 weeks later.

    <textblock>
      In high risk patients undergoing invasive angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has
      shown reduction of plaque for patients treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins).
      However, there is no accepted noninvasive method to determine if treatment for
      atherosclerosis results in reduction of coronary artery plaque.

      Coronary artery CT angiography (CCTA) is noninvasive and can accurately determine the degree
      of coronary artery stenosis. In addition, the extent of calcified and noncalcified plaque
      may be directly measured using this technology at low radiation dose using state-of-the-art
      CT scanners. Several retrospective studies have previously suggested that CCTA may be able
      to show plaque regression in the coronary arteries due to statin therapy.

      The primary aim of this proposal is to determine the change in coronary artery plaque volume
      in individuals treated with high intensity statin therapy as defined by 2013 ACC/AHA
      Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular
      Risk in Adults.

      Men and women who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo CCTA examination
      for the presence or absence of coronary artery plaque. Individuals with evidence of
      noncalcified coronary plaque by CCTA and who meet criteria for HMG-CoA reductase (statin)
      therapy will be evaluated for a total of 36 months. The change of coronary artery plaque
      (progression or no change, or regression) in individuals with noncalcified plaque at
      baseline will be measured by CCTA at yearly intervals.
