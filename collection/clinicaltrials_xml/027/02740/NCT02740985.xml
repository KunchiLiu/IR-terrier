  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter study of continuous oral dosing of AZD4635
      administered as a single agent and then in combination with a PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab.
      The study design allows an escalation of dose with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the
      safety of the patients. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two segments. The first segment of the study (Phase 1a) will
      be a dose escalation design in order to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of
      AZD4635 given as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab. The MTD will be determined
      by assessing adverse events and the incidence of abnormal laboratory measures. Once the
      maximum tolerated monotherapy dose of AZD4635 has been determined, combination dosing with
      durvalumab will start in a new cohort of patients at one dose level lower than the highest
      tolerated dose of AZD4635 monotherapy. The combination therapy cohorts in Phase 1a will also
      have a 2-week monotherapy lead-in after which patients who tolerate monotherapy AZD4635 will
      then continue twice daily dosing of AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab (anti
      programmed-death ligand 1 [PD-L1]) at the fixed dose of 1.5 grams IV every 4 weeks.

      When the maximum-tolerated dose in the combination setting is determined, additional
      patients with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled to a dose expansion portion to
      explore further the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biological activity at
      the selected doses. Approximately 24 to 36 patients with advanced solid malignancies will be
      treated in Phase 1a.

      The second segment of the study (Phase 1b) will consist of an additional expansion phase at
      the MTD of the combination in approximately 15 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who
      have previously received anti-PD-1 therapy, but either failed to respond or progressed after
      an initial response.

      At least one cohort in this study may investigate the preliminary effect of food on AZD4635.
      This may be performed in either a dose-escalation cohort (monotherapy or combination) or a
      dose-expansion cohort.

    <measure>The incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in patients receiving AZD4635 monotherapy orally.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks (One Cycle)</time_frame>
    <description>A Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) based approach will be used to identify the set of AZD4635 doses where the incidence of DLTs is no larger than 33%. It is planned that 24 to 36 patients in total will be included in the dose-escalation part of Phase Ia. In each cohort, up to 3 patients will be initially assessed. Dose escalation to the next higher dose level for the next cohort group of 3 patients will occur if all 3 patients in the initial cohort complete the first 3 weeks of dosing without a DLT. Following the first DLT, the BLRM model will be run and the output made available to the safety review committee (SRC) to guide further dosing decisions. Each dose cohort will include a maximum of 6 patients.</description>

    <description>AZD4635 monotherapy will be given twice daily in a dose escalation scheme. Patients will receive a single dose of AZD4635 on Day 1 and will have blood samples collected to assess pharmacokinetics over 24 hours. On Day 2, twice daily dosing will commence and continue daily. Other dosing schedules (e.g., once daily, three times daily) may be investigated during the study on the basis of emerging safety, PK, and exploratory mechanism of action (MOA) data. During monotherapy dosing, a cycle will be 3 weeks. The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will determine whether dose escalation should occur based on safety assessments in the first cycle supported by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) approach.</description>
