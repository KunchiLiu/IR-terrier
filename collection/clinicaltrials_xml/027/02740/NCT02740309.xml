      Study design: At baseline, all adolescents and young adults with IBD ages 12-21 years will
      be screened for anxiety and depression symptoms using the PHQ-9 and the Screen for Child
      Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) during a routine medical visit in the pediatric
      gastroenterology clinic. Individuals who screen positive for depression or anxiety will be
      assessed to confirm diagnoses using the anxiety and M.I.N.I. 6.0. Participants will also
      complete a psychosocial risk assessment as well as medical and socio-demographic
      inventories. The investigators will include youth that meet full criteria for major
      depressive disorder and any anxiety disorder, dysthymic disorder, and any adjustment
      disorder. The investigators will also include patients with subclinical symptoms that have
      significant psychosocial stressors in addition to their medical illness. Patients will be
      excluded if they have active suicidal ideation with plan requiring ER referral, bipolar
      disorder, psychosis, substance dependence, eating disorders, or significant intellectual
      disability/developmental delay. Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be randomly
      assigned to four sessions of IBBT administered on-site by a Fink social worker or treatment
      as usual (TAU), which is a facilitated community referral for mental health treatment.

    <measure>Change in Anxiety and/or Depression Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year ( baseline, 8-12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression symptoms are hypothesized to decrease more in the IBBT-4 group and psychosocial functioning is hypothesized to improve more in the IBBT-4 group as compared to TAU. The number of patients who no longer meet criteria for depression and/or anxiety after brief intervention is hypothesized to be greater than as compared to TAU. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be repeated self-report measures of depression and anxiety symptoms at each time point to assess symptomatology.The PHQ-9 consists of 9 questions scored 0-3, with 3 denoting the early every day ( highest value).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Engagement at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>One visit is the modal number of encounters for patients seeking treatment in the community mental health care settings. The investigators hypothesize that by implementing an integrated behavioral health model that identifies mental health issues in medical settings as part of routine care and engages individuals in on-site treatment for depression and anxiety will increase the number of completed mental health encounters utilized and the number of successful referrals to community mental health providers when ongoing treatment is needed.
Multiple measurements will be aggregated to arrive at 1 reported value.Data will be collected by tracking the number of sessions attended for IBBT-4 vs. the number of sessions attended for the treatment as usual group at 8 weeks post initial assessment as well as whether or not referrals to community mental health providers are successfully completed by either group at each time point.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SCARED will be repeated self-report measures of anxiety symptoms at each time point to assess symptomatology. SCARED is a 41-item screening tool with each scored from 0 to 2, with 2 denoting &quot;very true or often true&quot; (highest value). Total scores of 25 or greater indicate the presence of an Anxiety Disorder. Subscore cut off ranges are also provided for Panic Disorder or Significant Somatic Symptoms, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety, Social Anxiety, and School Avoidance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) will also be completed at baseline and at each time point for global psychosocial functioning.C-GAS is rated from 0 to 100, where 1 represents the most impaired functioning and 100 represents superior functioning.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline screening, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) will be used to assess for suicidal ideation or actions.CSSRS consists of ten categories and have binary responses (yes/no). A &quot;yes&quot; answer at any time during treatment to Categories 1-5 is defined as suicidal ideation. A &quot;yes&quot; answer at any time during treatment to Categories 6-10 is defined as suicidal behavior. A &quot;yes&quot; answer to any one of the ten suicidal ideation and behavior questions at any time during treatment to (Categories 1-10) is defined as suicidal ideation or behavior.</description>

    <measure>IBD disease activity - Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year ( Data will be collected at 4 time points: baseline, 8-12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>IBD disease activity will be assessed through validated Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) which measure symptom severity in a given time period through physician, laboratory, and subjective self-report markers of disease activity. These measures will be assessed at each time point. PUCAI score ranges from 0 to 85; a score of &lt; 10 denotes remission, 10-34 indicates mild disease, 35-64 indicates moderate disease, and 65-85 indicates severe disease.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year ( Data will be collected at 4 time points: baseline, 8-12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>IBD disease activity will be assessed through validated Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) which measure symptom severity in a given time period through physician, laboratory, and subjective self-report markers of disease activity.The PCDAI has hematocrit, Albumin and ESR as markers:ESR: 0-20 mm/hr, Albumin: 3.5 - 5.0 gm/dL, HCT: 35-47%. As for the disease indicators: PCDAI score can range from 0-100, with higher scores signifying more active disease.
