  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, multi-center observational cohort study. This study will be
      implemented first in Germany (approximately 50 sites), the United Kingdom (approximately 20
      sites) and Sweden (approximately 25 sites), followed by a selected number of countries in
      Europe, depending on apremilast local availability. The design of this apremilast
      retrospective study aims to provide clinical information regarding the treatment initiation
      and outcomes in psoriasis patients when prescribed apremilast in real world settings. In
      addition, this study is aiming at capturing physicians' and patients' treatment goals when
      initiating apremilast and whether these goals are achieved following apremilast use. This
      study is primarily descriptive in nature, and no a priori hypotheses are specified. Patients
      must voluntarily sign an informed consent form, be 18 or over, have been diagnosed with
      plaque psoriasis and have been treated with apremilast during the previous 5-7 months to
      participate in this study. They must not be involved in any other clinical study involving
      apremilast.

    <measure>The Patient Benefit Index (PBI) outcome score</measure>

    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) outcome score</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients achieving PASI75</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>PASI-75 response is the percentage of participants who achieved at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from baseline in PASI score at Week 16. The improvement in PASI score was used as a measure of efficacy. The PASI was a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The PASI score was set to missing if any severity score or degree of involvement is missing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentages of patients achieving PASI50</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>PASI score is based on an assessment of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling), and the percent area affected as observed on the day of examination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the participant is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score is derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in Body Surface Area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>BSA was a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis was estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand (entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in PGA</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the 3 primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall severity, the assessor factors in areas that have already cleared (ie, have scores of 0) and not just remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity of each sign was to be averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions</description>

        Patient charts will be selected for data abstraction by participating dermatologists and
        will be determined eligible for study enrollment based on the inclusion criteria. All
        consecutive adult psoriasis patients who can be contacted 6 months (+/- 1 month) following
        initiation of treatment with apremilast will be approached for entry to minimize bias in
        patient selection. All eligible patients will be included in consecutive order regarding
        the date of the signed Informed Consent.
