  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that the study drug, pembrolizumab, works by helping the immune system.
      In this way, pembrolizumab may help to slow the growth of melanoma or may cause cancer cells
      to die. Compared to standard treatments, pembrolizumab seems to lengthen the time patients
      lived overall and the time without their cancer getting worse.

    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to find out if a type of CT (computed topography) scan can
      help to know if pembrolizumab is working. This CT scan (called Texture Analysis) looks at
      the tumour in fine detail. The use of this type of CT scan has not been studied in patients
      with metastatic melanoma. Investigators want to see if this CT scan will show if some
      patients being treated with pembrolizumab respond better than others.

      One of the other purposes is to compare the costs within this trial to costs of the standard
      of care.

        registration and that wound healing has occurred.

        Systemic Therapy:

        Patients may not have received any prior systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma.
