  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a complex disease with a cluster of risk factors and clinical
      features, which includes central or abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, impaired
      glucose regulation, hyperinsulinemia, high blood pressure, and concomitance of
      pro-inflammatory cytokine and insulin resistance. The purposes of this study are going to
      investigate the effects of KGM noodle (KGN) as stable food on body weight, BMI, waist
      circumference, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile, as well as serum vitamin A, E,
      β-carotene and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CPR) in subjects with metabolic
      syndromerelation. The investigators will recruit MS patients (n=80) and the inclusion
      criteria of MS are according to the Bureau of Health Promotion, Department of Health in
      Taiwan (2007). The MS subjects are randomly assigned to placebo (n=40) and KGN (n=40)
      groups. Hopefully, the results of this study could evaluate the clinical associations of
      noodle plus Konjac Glucomannan as staple food on patients with MS subjects.

      The KGN diet was composed of well-cooked noodle with 2 g of KGM in a dosage of 200 g/piece
      twice daily to substitute the daily carbohydrate for 4 weeks, with a 2-week washout period
      between alternative diets. The body weight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose
      and lipid profile, as well as serum vitamin A, E, β-carotene and high sensitivity C-reactive
      protein (hs-CPR) were measured by HPCL.
