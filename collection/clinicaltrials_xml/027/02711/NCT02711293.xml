  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by community health workers (CHWs) has the
      potential to reduce key barriers to ART care retention. The primary endpoint of this trial
      is the effect of CHW-led home delivery of ART on the proportion of patients with a
      suppressed HIV viral load after six months follow-up. This is a cluster-randomized
      controlled trial set in Dar es Salaam's Temeke district. The unit of randomization is a
      healthcare facility with its surrounding neighborhoods. We matched all 18 healthcare
      facilities offering ART services in Temeke district into pairs based on having a similar
      number of patients currently on ART. In each pair, one cluster was randomized to the
      intervention and one to the control arm. The intervention consists of monthly home visits by
      CHWs to provide counseling and deliver ART to patients who are stable on ART, while the
      control is the standard of care (facility-based ART care and CHW home visits at least every
      three months without ART home delivery). In addition, within each study arm, half of the
      healthcare facilities were randomized to enhanced CHW-led nutrition counseling and half to
      standard counseling.
