  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare 3 types of interventions (involving
      electro-acupuncture and standard care) that are given to women with chronic post-surgical
      pain after a mastectomy. Researchers want to find out which intervention may be most
      effective in relieving breast pain. The safety of these 3 interventions will also be
      studied.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be randomly
      assigned (as in a roll of dice) into 1 of 3 groups. This is done because no one knows if one
      study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. Participant has an equal
      chance of being assigned to each group.

        -  Group 1 will receive up to 10 electro-acupuncture sessions over 4 weeks.
           Electro-acupuncture is a technique that seeks to treat symptoms by inserting very thin,
           solid, sterile, stainless steel needles into the skin at specific points.

        -  Group 2 will receive up tp 10 electro-acupuncture sessions over 4 weeks using slightly
           different techniques by placing needles at different points on the body than those used
           for Group 1. The acupuncture points used in Group 2 may not be as effective as those
           used in Group 1.

        -  Group 3 will receive standard care without any kind of acupuncture during the study
           period.

      If participant is assigned to receive electro-acupuncture, they will not know if they are
      assigned to Group 1 or 2.

      The acupuncture needles are small, solid, stainless steel needles that come in sterile
      single packages. A mild electrical current (electro-acupuncture) may be applied to the
      needles at a level that is comfortable for participant.

      Study Therapy:

      Participants in Groups 1 and 2 will receive a total of up to 10 electro-acupuncture
      sessions. About 2-3 sessions will be given each week for 4 weeks. Each electro-acupuncture
      session will take about 45 minutes to complete.

      Group 3 will be treated with standard care for post-surgical pain after a mastectomy.

      Study Visits:

      During Weeks 1-3, participant will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their level of
      pain. This will take about 5 minutes to complete.

      At the Week 4 visit, the following procedures will take place:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will complete the screening questionnaires.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for tests to measure biomarkers, including
           genetic biomarkers.

      If participant is not able to complete the questionnaires during their regularly-scheduled
      visits, they will be able to take the questionnaires home to complete them or they will be
      mailed to participant (if they are in Group 3). Participant will be given a postage-paid
      return envelope to mail them back to the study doctor.

      About 1 month later, at Week 8, participant will repeat the following procedures:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will complete the screening questionnaires.

      Length of Study:

      Participant will remain on study for up to 8 weeks. Participant may be taken off study early
      if their doctor thinks it is in their best interest or if they are unable to follow study
      instructions (such as keeping appointments or completing questionnaires).

      Follow-up Acupuncture Therapy:

      After participant's 8 weeks of study participation are over, if they were assigned to the
      wait list group or acupuncture group believed to be less effective (G2), they will be
      offered up to 10 sessions of the other acupuncture treatment in the 4 weeks following their
      study participation.

      This is an investigational study. Acupuncture needles are an FDA approved medical device,
      but acupuncture therapy itself is considered investigational.

      Up to 109 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
