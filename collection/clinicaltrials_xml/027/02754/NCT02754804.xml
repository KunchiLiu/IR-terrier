  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular claudication is a common cause of functional limitation. This painful condition is
      a source overall muscle deconditioning in the peripheral arterial diseased (PAD) patient
      leading gradually to a state accented inactivity. The characterization of the claudication
      as it results from a proximal or distal ischemia has never carried out. Investigators will
      analyze dynamic pedometer parameter throughout walking tests in PAD patients with
      claudication

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred for exercise tests on treadmill for the quantification of walking ability
      will gave a recording of their walking parameters through an instrumented treadmill
      recording biomechanic parameters (surface electromyography, walking pace; force of the
      foot/treadmill interface, length of the step.. etc.) Analysis will be performed until
      walking is stopped due to usual claudication during a constant load 2MPH 10% slope treadmill
      procedure.
