    <textblock>
      This is a post-market clinical study of the AccuLIF expandable TLIF cage in patients
      requiring surgery for degenerative disc disease (DDD) with up to Grade I spondylolisthesis
      or retrolisthesis, at one or two levels, between L2 and S1.

      Study evaluations will be evaluated pre-operatively and at 6-weeks, 3-months, 6-months,
      12-months and 24-months post-operatively to assess clinical outcomes, patient reported
      outcomes and radiographic status.
