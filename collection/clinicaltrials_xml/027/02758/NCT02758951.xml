    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC, combined
      with preoperative chemotherapy with targeted therapy and postoperative chemotherapy, results
      in improved overall survival compared to cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC alone in patients
      with peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer.

      A survival increase of 15% is expected in the systemic therapy group. Furthermore,
      neoadjuvant systemic therapy may allow for better patient selection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Both cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS +
      HIPEC) and systemic therapy are increasingly used for the treatment of peritoneal metastases
      of colorectal cancer (PMCRC). Subsequently, combined treatment strategies have been
      introduced. However, there is a worldwide controversy on the indication, effectiveness,
      timing, and risks of perioperative systemic therapy as adjunct to CRS + HIPEC for PMCRC.
      Although some studies describe the use of perioperative systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant
      or adjuvant setting, neither strategy has ever been prospectively investigated for patients
      undergoing CRS + HIPEC for PMCRC. Current literature on perioperative systemic therapy as
      adjunct to CRS + HIPEC is based on observational studies of low methodological quality. A
      neoadjuvant treatment strategy in order to downstage intraperitoneal tumour load, limit
      extensiveness of CRS, and predict the biological behaviour of the tumour, may be of
      potential benefit in these patients. In patients who proved to respond to neoadjuvant
      treatment, adjuvant systemic therapy in the same regimen may be of value by treating
      systemic micro-metastases.

      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the potential survival
      benefit of a perioperative treatment strategy consisting of neoadjuvant and adjuvant
      combination chemotherapy with neoadjuvant bevacizumab in patients undergoing CRS + HIPEC for
      PMCRC.

      Study design: This is a prospective multicentre randomised, parallel group study in which
      eligible patients will be randomised to neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy plus
      bevacizumab and CRS + HIPEC followed by adjuvant combination chemotherapy (experimental
      arm), or CRS + HIPEC alone (control arm). The study will start as a randomised phase II
      study to investigate the feasibility of this strategy in terms of accrual and to assess the
      safety of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy/bevacizumab prior to CRS + HIPEC. If criteria
      of feasibility and safety are met, the study will continue as a phase III study with 3-year
      overall survival as primary endpoint.

      Study population: Patients with non-signet cell synchronous or metachronous PMCRC, without
      systemic metastases at other sites, who are candidate for CRS + HIPEC (PCI score ≤20), and
      in whom (nearly) complete cytoreduction (CC-0 or CC-1) seems feasible.

      Intervention: Patients in the experimental arm will receive neoadjuvant combination
      chemotherapy plus bevacizumab for three 3-weekly (CAPOX + BEV) or four 2-weekly (FOLFOX +
      BEV) cycles, followed by restaging with thoraco-abdominal CT-scan. In case of progressive
      and unresectable disease, the best possible palliative treatment will be offered. In case of
      progressive but resectable disease, patients will undergo explorative laparotomy and
      subsequent CRS + HIPEC at least 6 weeks after the last cycle of bevacizumab is administered.
      In case of responsive or stable disease, one 3-weekly (CAPOX) or two 2-weekly (FOLFOX)
      neoadjuvant cycles of combination chemotherapy without bevacizumab will be administered.
      Subsequently, not earlier than 3 weeks after the last day of the last cycle of combination
      chemotherapy, explorative laparotomy and subsequent CRS + HIPEC will be performed. Only in
      patients with stable disease or response upon neoadjuvant treatment, adjuvant combination
      chemotherapy will be given according to the neoadjuvant regimen, but without bevacizumab,
      for four 3-weekly cycles (CAPOX) or six 2-weekly cycles (FOLFOX).

      Study parameters: Regarding feasibility and safety, endpoints of the phase II study are the
      number of randomised patients 1 year after the start of accrual at all participating
      centres, major postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III-V) at 3 months
      postoperatively, and the number of patients receiving CRS + HIPEC. Secondary endpoints are
      minor postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade II) and systemic therapy related
      toxicity (NCICTCAE v4.0 Grade II-V). The phase II study is deemed unfeasible if &lt;80 patients
      are randomised, and deemed unsafe if:

        -  There is a more than 7 patients difference in major postoperative complications in
           disadvantage of the experimental arm compared to the control arm.

        -  less than 50% (20/40) of included patients in the experimental arm are able to proceed
           to CRS + HIPEC.

      The primary endpoint of the phase III study is 3-year overall survival. Secondary endpoints
      are 5-year overall survival, 3 and 5-year disease free survival, procedure related
      characteristics (i.e. operative time, blood loss), peritoneal cancer index (PCI) score,
      completeness of cytoreduction (CC) score, major postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo
      grade III-V) at 90-days postoperatively, hospital stay, quality of life, and
      cost-effectiveness. In the experimental arm, additional secondary endpoints are severe
      systemic therapy-related toxicity (NCICTCAE v4.0 grade III-V), and the number of patients
      with progression, stable disease, and response to neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy plus
      bevacizumab.

      Sample size: The phase II study will include 80 patients, with 40 patients in each arm.
      After fulfilling the criteria of feasibility of randomisation and safety of neoadjuvant
      combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, the study will continue as a phase III
      superiority study with 3 year overall survival as primary endpoint. The expected 3-year
      overall survival after CRS + HIPEC is 50%. We hypothesize that the experimental treatment
      will result in a 15% increase in overall survival rate if analysed according to an
      intention-to-treat principle. With a 0.05 two-sided significance level, 80% power and a
      drop-out of 5%, a sample size of 170 patients in each arm is needed, resulting in a total of
      340 patients, including the 80 patients from the phase II study.

      Time schedule: In 2016, the expected number of patients referred for CRS + HIPEC for PMCRC
      in the Netherlands is 250. With an expected participation rate of 40%, accrual should be
      completed in 4 years.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks: In the experimental arm, the risk of this study
      primarily consists of treatment-related toxicity and morbidity of combination chemotherapy
      and bevacizumab, which should be weighed against potential survival benefit. Furthermore,
      some patients in the experimental arm may have disease progression upon neoadjuvant
      treatment to an extent that does not allow CRS + HIPEC. However, it is highly questionable
      whether these patients would have derived a benefit from upfront CRS + HIPEC at all, and the
      investigators hypothesise that a neoadjuvant treatment strategy allows for better patient
      selection and spares the morbidity of this intervention to patients who are unlikely to
      benefit.
