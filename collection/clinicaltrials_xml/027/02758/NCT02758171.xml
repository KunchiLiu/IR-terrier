  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the bioequivalence of one fix dose
      combination tablet of empagliflozin/linagliptin (Test, T) compared with the free combination
      of one empagliflozin tablet and one linagliptin tablet (Reference, R) administered as single
      dose under fasted conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subjects according to the investigators assessment, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood
             Pressure [PB], Pulse Rate [PR]), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical
             laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (incl.)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP (Good Clinical Practice) and local legislation

          -  Male subjects, or female subjects who meet any of the following criteria starting
             from at least 30 days before the first administration of trial medication and until
             30 days after trial completion:

          -  Use of adequate contraception, e.g. any of the following methods plus condom:
             implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives, intrauterine device

          -  Sexually abstinent

          -  A vasectomised sexual partner (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to enrolment)

          -  Surgically sterilised (including hysterectomy)

          -  Postmenopausal, defined as at least 1 year of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable
             cases a blood sample with simultaneous levels of FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)
             above 40 U/L and estradiol below 30 ng/L is confirmatory)

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure [BP], Pulse Rate
             [PR] or Electrocardiogram [ECG]) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically
             relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside
             the range of 45 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to
             be of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  Further exclusion criteria apply
