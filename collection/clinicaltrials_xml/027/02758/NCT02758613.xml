    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of the study
      drug known as LY3009104 in healthy Chinese participants. The study will measure how the body
      absorbs, breaks down and gets rid of LY3009104. The study will last about 20 days, not
      including screening. This study is for research purposes only, and is not intended to treat
      any medical condition.
