  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Electromagnetic field exposure using
      a Tablet on MICRA device (leadless pacemaker) as well as study the effects of
      Electromagnetic field exposure using a smart phone on MICRA device.

    <textblock>
      With advancement in technology people are exposed to new sources of electromagnetic field
      like Tablet, smart phones etc. There are magnets in Smart Phones and Tablets that could
      affect the functions of pacemakers. The main purpose of this study is to study effects of
      Electromagnetic field exposure using a Tablet and smartphone on participants that have a
      Leadless Pacemaker (MICRA device) implanted inside them. Participants will be asked to
      report any symptoms that they might experience during the testing.

    <description>Testing of the electromagnetic field exposure and it's affect on the participant's previously implanted MICRA device is assessed by interrogation of the device before using Tablet and while using the Tablet. The measured position of the Tablets tested will be normal routine position (noting at least 6 inches/15 centimeters from their pacemaker).</description>
