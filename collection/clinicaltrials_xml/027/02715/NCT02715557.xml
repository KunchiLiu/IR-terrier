      In Phase I of this SBIR project, 3C Institute (3C) developed a working prototype of For Life
      (henceforth Arise), an innovative computer-based coping skills educational program for
      adolescent substance abuse treatment completers. For Phase I, 3C developed and tested two
      customizable intelligent educational modules to teach coping skills in order to help
      adolescents avoid relapse, along with a brief instructional game for each segment. The Phase
      I prototype for Arise also included an online Parent Guide to inform parents about the uses
      and benefits of the product. Phase I R&amp;D provided strong support for the quality and value
      of the prototype as well as the viability of the proposed educational package and its
      promise for preventing substance abuse relapse with adolescents. Phase I results supported
      excellent quality of the product through high ratings of quality, appeal, and value. High
      feasibility and usability was also demonstrated through high ratings for ease of use,
      usability, and potential effectiveness.

      The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to modify and expand the Arise program developed
      in Phase I in response to customer feedback and to evaluate the efficacy of the full program
      with an RCT pilot clinical study. This product will be an adaptable software program for
      aftercare therapy. In Phase II, the investigators will build on the Phase I findings to
      modify and extend the existing content and develop the full Arise program, which will
      include: an introductory module as well as interactive lessons and skill-building games for
      five coping skills modules. The Phase II product will also include a HelpCenter to support
      sustained, quality use of the product during commercialization.

      Purpose:

      In Phase I of this SBIR project, 3C Institute (3C) developed a working prototype of For Life
      (henceforth Arise), an innovative computer-based coping skills educational program for
      adolescent substance abuse treatment completers. For Phase I, 3C developed and tested two
      customizable intelligent educational modules to teach coping skills in order to help
      adolescents avoid relapse, along with a brief instructional game for each segment. The Phase
      I prototype for Arise also included an online Parent Guide to inform parents about the uses
      and benefits of the product. Phase I R&amp;D provided strong support for the quality and value
      of the prototype as well as the viability of the proposed educational package and its
      promise for preventing substance abuse relapse with adolescents. Phase I results supported
      excellent quality of the product through high ratings of quality, appeal, and value. High
      feasibility and usability was also demonstrated through high ratings for ease of use,
      usability, and potential effectiveness.

      The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to modify and expand the Arise program developed
      in Phase I in response to customer feedback and to evaluate the efficacy of the full program
      with an RCT pilot clinical study. This product will be an adaptable software program for
      aftercare therapy. In Phase II, the investigators will build on the Phase I findings to
      modify and extend the existing content and develop the full Arise program, which will
      include: an introductory module as well as interactive lessons and skill-building games for
      five coping skills modules. The Phase II product will also include a HelpCenter to support
      sustained, quality use of the product during commercialization.

      Research Design:

      Throughout development and iterative usability testing, the project consultants, experts in
      the field of adolescent substance abuse treatment and prevention, will review and interact
      with Arise, and results will be used to modify and finalize the user interface and
      navigation to maximize usability prior to pilot testing with adolescents. Once all revisions
      and additions have been completed and integrated into the fully functioning product, the
      investigators will conduct an RCT pilot clinical study with up to 125 adolescents aged 15 -
      17 years in substance abuse recovery to evaluate the benefits and effectiveness of Arise.
      The investigators will use a rolling enrollment staggered entry design in which adolescents
      will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) Group A, in which participants will
      receive access to Arise throughout the entire 12-week trial period, or (b) Group B, in which
      participants will receive treatment as usual (TAU) for 6-weeks, followed by access to Arise
      starting at the midpoint of the 12-week trial period. Over the trial, the following outcome
      areas will be assessed: substance use and cravings, substance abuse recovery and relapse
      knowledge, perceived benefits of substance use, coping behaviors and coping, stage of
      change, and treatment as usual description. The investigators will also assess usability and
      acceptability of Arise and gather information on adverse events/serious adverse events that
      occur during interaction with the program.

      Hypotheses:

      Based on Phase I findings and 3C's experience developing similar products, the investigators
      expect high user ratings on the Arise product, and anticipate improvement in outcomes across
      all areas to be synchronized with date of access to Arise, providing evidence for the
      promise of this new educational program for generating beneficial substance use abstinence
      outcomes. The investigators do not expect participation in the program to be associated with
      any negative outcomes. The investigators expect Phase II findings to demonstrate greater
      sobriety maintenance for adolescents with access to Arise compared to those in typical
      aftercare activities.

      Length of Study:

      The investigators anticipate the pilot phase of this study, including recruitment,
      conducting the pilot RCT, and collecting 6-month follow-up data to last 17 months.

      Confidentiality:

      Due to the sensitive nature of this study, the investigators have obtained a Certificate of
      Confidentiality from NIDA. The Certificate number is CC-DA-16-061, and is valid from
      9/17/2014 - 9/17/2018.

    <description>As directed by the contract, the investigators will use the NIDA Common Data Element Timeline Follow-Back measure (TLFB; Sobell &amp; Sobell, 1992) for self-report. Adolescents will complete the TLFB reporting past 30 day use. Adolescents will be presented with a calendar showing the previous 30 days and will be asked to indicate whether or not they used substances each day. For days in which either alcohol or tobacco use is indicated, adolescents will be asked to report the quantity used. The investigators will also measure substance use with a toxicology report. The participant will submit an oral swab for toxicology screening directly to the third-party laboratory, LabCorp, which will evaluate oral swabs for 10 different substances. After the results have been read, the toxicology analyses will be emailed to study staff with the de-identified study number.</description>
