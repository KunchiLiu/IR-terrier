    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, first-in-human Phase 1 study evaluating the anti
      programmed death receptor 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody TSR-042 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors who have limited available treatment options. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:
      dose escalation and cohort expansion.

    <description>Using a modified 3+3 design, Part 1 (dose escalation) will initially evaluate ascending weight-based dose levels of TSR-042 administered via intravenous (IV) infusion, once every two weeks.
Part 2 - Expansion Cohort - Part 2 of the study will further explore the safety and clinical activity of TSR-042 in patients with selected tumor types. Dosing in Part 2 will be initiated with the dose determined to be safe based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in Part 1 with consideration of available Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with histologically or cytologically proven advanced (unresectable) or
             metastatic solid tumor and has disease progression after treatment with available
             therapies that are known to confer clinical benefit or who are intolerant to
             treatment that meets the following requirements for the part of the study they will
             participate in:

               1. Part 1: Any advanced or metastatic solid tumor patient

               2. Part 2: For selected tumor types archival tumor tissue available that is
                  formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded or a new biopsy must be performed to obtain
                  a tissue sample prior to study treatment initiation.

          -  Female patients, if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test within 72 hours prior to the date of the first dose of study medication.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients must agree to use 2
             adequate methods of contraception with their partner starting with the screening
             visit through 150 days after the last dose of study therapy.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2 for Part 1 and ≤
             1 for Part 2.

          -  Adequate organ function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed death receptor 1
             (anti-PD-1), anti-PD-1-ligand-1 (anti-PD-L1), or anti-PD-1 ligand-2 (anti-PD-L2)
             agent.

          -  Known uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Note: Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate
             provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4
             weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment and any neurologic symptoms have
             returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are
             clinically stable off steroids for at least 7 days prior to study treatment.
             Carcinomatous meningitis precludes a patient from study participation regardless of
             clinical stability.

          -  Known additional malignancy that progressed or required active treatment within the
             last 2 years. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell
             cancer (SqCC) of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ
             cervical cancer.

          -  Poor medical risk.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within the projected
             duration of the study.

          -  Immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Known active hepatitis B (eg, hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] reactive) or
             hepatitis C (eg, hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) (qualitative) is
             detected).

          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (ie, with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  History of interstitial lung disease.

          -  Patient has not recovered (ie, to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline) from radiation- and
             chemotherapy-induced adverse events (AEs) or received transfusion of blood products
             (including platelets or red blood cells) or administration of colony-stimulating
             factors (including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte
             macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or recombinant erythropoietin) within 3
             weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of
             an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device
             within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Received prior anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, targeted therapies, radiotherapy, or
             immunotherapy) within 21 days, or less than 5 times the half-life of the most recent
             therapy prior to study Day 1, whichever is shorter. Note: palliative radiation
             therapy to a small field ≥ 1 week prior to Day 1 of study treatment may be allowed.

          -  Patient has not recovered adequately (≤ Grade 1) from AEs and/or complications from
             any major surgery prior to starting therapy.

          -  Patient has received a vaccine within 7 days of planned start of study therapy.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to TSR-042 components or excipients.
