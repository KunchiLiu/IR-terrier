      Study Groups:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, they will be randomly assigned (as in the
      flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Participant will have an equal (50/50) chance of being
      assigned to either group.

      Both Group 1 and Group 2 will have standard, face-to-face follow-up visits. Group 1 will be
      the control group and will have no mobile device intervention. However, if participant is
      assigned to Group 2, they will also be asked to record videos between follow-up visits and
      send them to the study staff. The study staff will provide the mobile device for recording
      the videos.

      Visits for Group 1 (Control Group):

      About 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks after surgery, participant will have standard follow-up visits.
      Participant will not have any visits or procedures that are specific to this study. However,
      participant will complete questionnaires that are specific to this study.

      Participant will be asked to sit in a chair, stand, walk about 10 feet, turn around, return
      to the chair, and sit down. During another test, participant will be asked to walk a certain
      distance (about 30 feet) while a physical therapist watches their steps. Participant will be
      asked to walk around the room in certain ways, and step over lines on the floor. Participant
      will also fill out a survey about their physical and emotional health as well as their pain.
      At the end of the study, participant will be asked to fill out another questionnaire
      regarding the study. Both the physical tests and the surveys should take about 15 minutes to
      complete. In addition, at the end of the study, participant will be asked to fill out a
      questionnaire about the study.

      Visits for Group 2:

      At a scheduled clinic visit before participant's surgery, they will be taught how to take
      photos of their surgical wounds and make videos using a mobile device.

      About 2, 6,12, and 24 weeks after surgery, participant will have standard follow-up visits
      which will include the same surveys and physical therapy measures described above. However,
      at Weeks 3, 7, 13, and 25 participant will use a mobile device to send the study staff
      photos of their surgical wound and video of them walking. These updates will help
      participant's doctor to check their recovery. The photos participants will take will only be
      of a small area of skin near their wound.

      For the videos, participants will need a family member or friend to hold the mobile device
      camera and record video of them as they walk 10 feet away from the camera and then walk back
      toward the camera. Participant will also repeat this with the camera viewing from the side
      as they walk 10 feet back and forth.

      At the end of each follow-up visit, participant will complete an electronic questionnaire
      about their quality of life. This should take about 10 minutes.

      In addition, participant's doctor will have a video conference at Weeks 3, 7, 13, and 25. At
      any time the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will also have a video conference with
      their doctor. Participant will be asked basic follow-up information about their wound and
      overall health questions. This should take about 5-10 minutes.

      Participant will return the mobile device after completion of their 25-week follow up visit
      using the mobile device.

      Length of Study:

      If participant is in Group 1, their participation in this study will be over after the
      24-week follow-up has been completed. If participant is in Group 2, their participation will
      be over after the 25-week follow-up has been completed.

      Participant's study participation may end early if they are unable to follow study
      directions.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 12 clinicians will also take
      part in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
