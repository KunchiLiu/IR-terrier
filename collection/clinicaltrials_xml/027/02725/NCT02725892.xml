      National, prospective, multicentric, non-interventional registry-based study, conducted
      among oncologists, pulmonologists in community and university hospitals, from the public
      sector in Algeria.

      The study will collect information on the characteristics, and lung carcinomas patterns of
      patients whose lung cancer diagnosis was confirmed by a pathologist during the study period.

      The study consists of:

        -  All patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria presenting to their
           oncologists/pulmonologists for a routine visit during recruitment period will be
           sequentially asked to participate to the study.

        -  The patients who do not consent will only be reported as new case of lung cancer for
           the incidence study.

      The patients who consent to participate to the study will perform four in-hospital visits
      (Inclusion visit, visit at 3, 6 and 12 months). In addition to the 4 visits, a phone contact
      with the patients every 6 months at years 2,3, 4 and 5 will be done by the investigator or
      one of his/her authorised representative or the CRO or during a routine visit to the
      investigator, to check the patient's survival status.

        each sanitary region defined by the Ministry of health, the investigational centres will
        propose to all patients whom met illegibility criteria to participate to the study.

        Whenever possible, comprehensive lists of hospitals will be used as a data source in the
        site selection process. Lists will be obtained either from national authorities, local
        scientific societies or professional associations, depending on the local availability of
        this type of information. All efforts will be made to approach and select sites/physicians
        for the present study if they can provide a representative sample.

        The formal sample size will be calculated among the representatives hospitals sites
