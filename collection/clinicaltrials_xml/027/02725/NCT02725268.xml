      paclitaxel improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to weekly paclitaxel alone.

    <textblock>
      The drugs being evaluated in this study are MLN0128 and MLN1117. MLN0128 is being evaluated
      as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel or MLN1117 to treat women with
      advanced, recurrent, or persistent endometrial cancer. This study will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of each drug or drug combination.

      The study will enroll approximately 260 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of 4 treatment groups:

        -  Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 weekly

        -  Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 weekly + MLN0128 4 mg 3 consecutive days each week

        -  MLN0128 30 mg weekly

        -  MLN0128 4 mg + MLN1117 200 mg both given 3 consecutive days each week

      Participants will receive either Paclitaxel intravenous (IV) weekly, Paclitaxel IV along
      with MLN0128 orally, MLN0128 orally, or MLN0128 and MLN1117 orally.

      This is a multicenter, multinational trial. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, with an end of treatment visit (EOT) which will occur 30 to 40 days after receiving
      their last dose of study drug or before the start of any subsequent anticancer therapy.
      After EOT, participants will be followed for PFS and overall survival (OS).

             serous, mixed adenocarcinoma, clear-cell carcinoma, or carcinosarcoma).

          2. Evidence that the endometrial cancer is advanced, recurrent, or persistent and has
             relapsed or is refractory to curative therapy or established treatments.

          3. At least 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen, but not more than 2 prior
             chemotherapeutic regimens, for management of endometrial carcinoma. Prior treatment
             may include chemotherapy, chemotherapy/radiation therapy, and/or
             consolidation/maintenance therapy. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with
             primary radiation as a radio-sensitized therapy will be considered a systemic
             chemotherapy regimen.

             defined as at least 1 lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension
             (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be ≥ 10 mm in long axis when
             measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or caliper
             measurement by clinical exam. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when measured
             by CT or MRI.

               -  Are surgically sterile, OR

               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 1 highly effective
                  method of contraception and 1 additional effective (barrier) method at the same
                  time, from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days (or longer,
                  as mandated by local labeling [eg, United States Prescribing Information (USPI),
                  Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), etc.]) after the last dose of study
                  drug, OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, postovulation methods], withdrawal, spermicides only, and
                  lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female and
                  male condoms should not be used together.)
