    <textblock>
      Combining Vigil™ with Durvalumab (MEDI4736) will allow Vigil™ to increase the infiltration
      of activated T cells into tumors, and in addition, to enhance PD-L1 (programmed cell death
      ligand 1) expression. Consequently, the response rate of historically unresponsive PD-L1
      negative cancer to Durvalumab (MEDI4736) will reach a level similar to that achieved in
      PD-L1 positive cancer.

      This is an open label pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the
      combination of Vigil™ autologous tumor cell immunotherapy and Durvalumab (programmed cell
      death ligand 1) inhibitor in patients with PD-L1 negative locally advanced or metastatic
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), regardless of the number of prior therapies. PD-L1
      negative tumor status is defined as &lt; 1% membranous PD-L1 staining with antihuman PDL1
      rabbit monoclonal antibody SP263 (Ventana, Tucson, AZ) of neoplastic cells.

      Patients undergoing a standard surgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy, palliative resection,
      thoracentesis of malignant pleural effusion) will have tumor tissue procured for manufacture
      of Vigil™ vaccine. This will be a 2 part study. The first part will be a safety run-in
      comprised of 2 cohorts that will use a 3 + 3 design to determine the Vigil™ dose in Part 2.
      Cohort 1 will receive a low dose of Vigil™ (1x10^6 cells/intradermal (ID) injection) in
      combination with Durvalumab (1500 mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. Cohort
      2 will receive Vigil™ at 1x10^7 cells/ID injection and Durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV
      over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. If needed, Cohort -1 will be used which will receive Vigil™
      at 1x10^5 cells/ID injection and Durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4
      weeks. The enrollment of the first two patients in each Cohort of Part 1 will be staggered
      by 2 weeks, In Part 2 of the study, patients meeting study eligibility criteria will receive
      Vigil™at the dose determined in Part 1 and Durvalumab (1500mg (if &gt; 30 kg) IV over 60
      minutes) every 4 weeks.

      Three to six weeks after tissue procurement has occurred eligibility will be reconfirmed by
      the study site. Subjects must begin the study regimen within 6 weeks of tissue procurement.
      Radiological assessment of tumor response should be performed at screening, Cycle 3 and
      every 2nd cycle thereafter, and end of treatment (EOT) using RECIST 1.1 and investigator
      assessment. Tumor biopsy for correlative studies including scoring of tumor infiltrating
      lymphocyte (TIL) and PD-1 and PD-L1 expression analysis should be obtained at tissue
      procurement and at Cycle 3. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for correlative
      studies should be obtained at pre-procurement, and prior to study regimen administration at
      Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 5 and EOT. Patient survival will be followed for 1 year after
      treatment initiation.
