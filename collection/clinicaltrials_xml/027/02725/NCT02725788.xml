    <description>A commercially available breathable, transparent film dressing with a soft-cloth border, notch and securement tape strip. The dressing system is used in the study to cover a peripheral intravenous catheter insertion site and secure the catheter. Dressing system is to remain in place until the PIV catheter is discontinued which is anticipated to be 72 hours. The dressing and PIV site will be observed daily. If dressing excessively lifts from the skin, the dressing system will be replaced with the same, assigned dressing system. The number of dressing replacements and the duration of wear will be measured while the same study PIV catheter dwells, an average of 72 hours during the subject's hospitalization.</description>
