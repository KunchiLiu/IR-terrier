  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-centre, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, 6-treatment, 4-period
      crossover, incomplete block design, in situ caries study in healthy adults who wear a
      removable bilateral mandibular partial denture. The denture will be modified to accommodate
      4 gauze-covered specimens of human dental enamel (4x3mm) that have been previously
      demineralized in vitro to form either S or low-R lesions (2 specimens of each lesion type
      will be used with each participant). After 14 days of twice daily product use off-site, the
      2 S lesion specimens will be removed at the study site, with the remaining 2 low-R lesion
      specimens removed at the study site after a further 14 days of product use. To determine the
      remineralization ability of the treatments, all specimens will be analyzed by transverse
      microradiography (TMR) and enamel fluoride uptake (EFU), with the S lesions additionally
      analyzed by surface micro hardness (SMH) and the low-R lesions additionally analyzed by
      quantitative light fluorescence (QLF).

    <description>Changes in the mineral content of the four centrally-located enamel specimens will be evaluated using the Surface Microhardness (SMH) Test. The SMH will be measured using a Wilson 2100 Hardness Tester. The baseline SMH will be determined prior to the in vitro acid challenge. SMH will be determined again after the in vitro acid challenge, after the in situ remineralization test, and again after the second in vitro acid challenge.</description>
