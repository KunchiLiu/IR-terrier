  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial intends to see how the two different products, the medical device in micro-enema
      and the drug given by mouth, act in giving the child regular evacuation after 1 week of
      daily use, 1 week of use every other day and 2 weeks of use &quot;as needed&quot;. The hypothesis is
      that the protective micro-enema will help to achieve regular evacuation by its local
      antinflammatory non pharmacological action. This hypothesis comes from the observation that
      local anal inflammation can cause functional constipation due to discomfort and pain during
      evacuation or by influencing reflexes.
