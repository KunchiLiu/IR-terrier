    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, multiple dose, varied administration regimen
      study with 2 parts (Parts A and B).

      Part A will utilize an ascending dose cohort design with sequential cohorts. Each cohort
      will be evaluated by the DSMB for safety. Additional cohorts may be added by the DSMB in
      order to determine the optimal dose.

      Approximately 80 subjects will be assigned sequentially to 1 of the following dosing cohorts
      (20 subjects per cohort) and randomized in a 4:1 ratio (active:placebo) within each cohort.
      Randomization will be stratified so that no more than 2 HBeAg positive subjects will be
      assigned to receive placebo. The cohorts receiving 100 or 200 mg SB 9200 must contain at
      least 12 subjects who are HBeAg positive.

        -  SB 9200 25 mg or matching placebo administered QD for 12 weeks of treatment. All
           subjects will then receive tenofovir 300 mg QD for an additional 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  SB 9200 50 mg or matching placebo administered QD for 12 weeks of treatment. All
           subjects will then receive tenofovir 300 mg QD for an additional 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  SB 9200 100 mg or matching placebo administered QD for 12 weeks of treatment. All
           subjects will then receive tenofovir 300 mg QD for an additional 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  SB 9200 200 mg or matching placebo administered QD for 12 weeks of treatment. All
           subjects will then receive tenofovir 300 mg QD for an additional 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  Based on the data from the first 4 cohorts and recommendation from the DSMB, a fifth
           cohort may be necessary to enroll. Another 20 subjects may be administered SB 9200 or
           matching placebo administered QD for 12 weeks. All subjects will then receive tenofovir
           300 mg QD for an additional 12 weeks of treatment.

      After informed consent is obtained, subjects will enter into a Screening period, which will
      last up to 28 days. Once all eligibility criteria are confirmed and the subject is
      randomized, subjects will receive the IP or placebo as a 2-week supply of capsules. All
      randomized subjects will receive the IP or matching placebo for a total of 12 weeks. No more
      than 2 HBeAg positive subjects can receive placebo per the randomization scheme.

      Subjects will start the treatment period on Day 1. The PK samples will be collected on Day 1
      at predose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours (predose the following day). At Week 6, the
      same sampling times will be used to collect PK samples from the subjects to collect steady
      state PK data. Subjects will return biweekly for the entire 12-week IP treatment period,
      except when beginning IP administration, for safety assessments including physical
      examination and laboratory sample analysis of chemistry, hematology, and urine. Sample
      collection for efficacy will be collected at each visit. A sample for genotyping will be
      collected at Day 1. Sample collection for Locarnini biomarkers and other biomarkers will
      also occur at predose at Day 1; Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 14; and at the End of Study Visit.
      Samples for cytokine levels will be collected predose at Day 1, Week 6, and Week 12. At Week
      12, the end of IP administration, all subjects will return to the clinic and be administered
      IP and 300 mg tenofovir. Samples will be collected to explore the potential of a drug-drug
      interaction between SB 9200 and tenofovir. All subjects will have a predose PK sample taken
      and then take last dose of IP / placebo together with their first dose of tenofovir.
      Pharmacokinetic samples will be then collected for SB 9200 and tenofovir at 30 minutes, 1,
      2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. Thereafter, the subjects will receive tenofovir 300 mg QD for an
      additional 12 weeks as 4-week supplies. All subjects will return to the clinic at Weeks 13,
      14, 16, 20, and 24. Subjects will have safety assessments including symptom-directed
      physical examinations and safety hematology, biochemistry, and virological studies performed
      at these visits.

      After randomization into the study, subjects will then be eligible to enroll into a separate
      extension study to receive treatment with tenofovir for up to 52 weeks. In this Extension
      Period, subjects will return to the clinic for standard of care (SOC) visits every 3 months
      with laboratory tests of liver function and virological efficacy including HBsAg, HBeAg,
      HBeAb and HBV DNA. No further study related testing will be performed.

      Safety reporting for each subject in each cohort will continue after the subject first
      consents to participate in the study through the 24-week duration of the IP or placebo and
      SOC tenofovir monotherapy or through the Extension Period until 30 days after the last dose
      is administered.

      Part B will utilize an open-label, randomized, combination therapy design. The study is
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral response of the chosen dose and
      regimen from Part A administered for 12 weeks, either alone or in combination with tenofovir
      300 mg QD. Randomization will be stratified based on HBeAg status (+/-), HBV viral load (&lt;
      10(6) or ≥ 10(6) IU/mL), and HBsAg baseline levels (&lt; 10(3) or ≥ 10(3) IU/mL).

      Two of the 5 arms will administer 2 optimal dosing regimens as monotherapy with SB 9200. Two
      of the 5 arms in Part B will administer the same 2 optimal doses from Part A and tenofovir
      300 mg QD. The fifth arm will administer tenofovir 300 mg QD as monotherapy.

      In Part B, subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1
      fashion to 1 of 5 treatment cohorts with 40 subjects per cohort:

        -  SB 9200 optimal dose 1 from PART A alone

        -  SB 9200 optimal dose 2 from PART A alone

        -  SB 9200 optimal dose 1 from PART A administered with tenofovir 300 mg QD

        -  SB 9200 optimal dose 2 from PART A administered with tenofovir 300 mg QD

        -  Tenofovir alone, 300 mg QD

      Subjects will be enrolled into the Screening period, which will last up to 28 days. Once all
      eligibility criteria are confirmed, subjects will receive the IP as a 2-week supply of
      capsules with tenofovir given as a 4-week supply. Subjects will be required to take the IP
      per protocol for 12 weeks. During the 12-week treatment period, subjects will return to the
      clinic at biweekly intervals, except when beginning IP administration, for safety
      assessments including physical examination and laboratory sample analysis of chemistry,
      hematology, and urine. Sample collection for Locarnini biomarkers will occur at Day 1; Weeks
      2, 4, 8, 12, and 14; and at the End of Study Visit. Sample collection for cytokine levels
      and other biomarkers of immune response and plasma samples will also occur at predose on Day
      1 and at Weeks 6 and 12. Sample collection for population PK analysis will also be collected
      predose on Day 1, 2 hours postdose on Day 1, and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.

      Additional arms of combination therapy may be added to explore different frequencies of
      administration. Depending on the data collected in Part A, additional confirmatory arms may
      be necessary.

      At Week 12, all subjects will be administered tenofovir 300 mg QD for an additional 12
      weeks, with 4-week supplies of tenofovir. All subjects will return to the clinic at Weeks
      13, 14, 16, 20, and 24. Subjects will have safety assessments including symptom-directed
      physical examinations and safety hematology, biochemistry, and virological studies performed
      at these visits.

      After randomization into the study, subjects will then be eligible to enroll into a separate
      extension study to receive treatment with tenofovir for up to 52 weeks. In this Extension
      Period, subjects will return to the clinic for SOC visits every 3 months with laboratory
      tests of liver function and virological efficacy including HBsAg, HBeAg, HBeAb, and HBV DNA.
      No further study-related testing will be performed.

      Any subject who is randomized into Part A or Part B may consent to take part in a 12-month
      Extension Period. Before any study-related procedures are performed, the subjects will have
      all study procedures explained to them, including information regarding the nature of the
      study, and subjects must sign an informed consent/assent form. During the Extension Period,
      subjects will receive tenofovir and return for visits every 3 months for follow-up safety
      and efficacy assessments.

             elevated indirect bilirubin and known Gilbert's disease can be included if direct
             bilirubin is within normal limits. Subjects with an AFP &gt; 50 ng/mL but less than 500
             ng/mL can be included if computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) performed within 3 months shows no evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma

          5. Creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dL, creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt; 50 mL/min

          6. Co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or
             hepatitis D virus (HDV)

          7. Evidence or history of hepatocellular carcinoma

          8. Malignancy within 5 years prior to Screening, with the exception of specific cancers
             that are cured by surgical resection (basal cell skin cancer, etc). Patients under
             evaluation for possible malignancy are not eligible.

          9. Significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, or neurological disease

         10. Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant

         11. Received within 3 months of Screening or expected to receive prolonged therapy with
             immunomodulators (e.g., corticosteroids) or biologics (e.g., monoclonal antibody,
             IFN)

         12. Patients currently taking medication(s) that are transported through organic anion
             transporting polypeptide 1 (OATP1) including, but not limited to, atazanavir,
             rifampin, cyclosporine, eltrombopag, gemfibrozil, lopinavir/ritonavir, and saquinavir

         13. Use of another investigational agent within 3 months of Screening

         14. Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the Investigator to potentially
             interfere with compliance

         15. Females who are pregnant or may wish to become pregnant during the study

         16. If the Investigator believes the prospective subject will not be able to comply with
             the requirements of the protocol and complete the study

        Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled into the
        Extension Period:

          1. Any condition, comorbidity, or laboratory abnormality which, based on the package
             insert of tenofovir or in the opinion of the Investigator, excludes the subject.

          2. Subjects who were withdrawn from Part A or Part B due to an AE or serious adverse
             event (SAE) related to the use of tenofovir.

          3. Participation in any other interventional study.
