  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anetumab ravtansine is developed for the treatment of patients with recurrent
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The purpose of the proposed trial is to identify the
      maximum tolerated dose of anetumab ravtansine that could be safely combined with pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin in this indication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must provide a signed informed consent before any screening procedures.

          -  Subject must be female and aged â‰¥18 years.

          -  Subject must have histologically confirmed, locally invasive or metastatic,
             predominantly epithelial platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
             peritoneal cancer.

          -  Subject must have recurrent, platinum-resistant cancer

          -  Subjects must provide samples of archival tumor tissue (tissue block or at least 5
             formalin-fixated, paraffin-embedded [FFPE] slides) at any time during the study.

          -  Subject must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0 or 1.

          -  Subject must have adequate bone marrow, kidney and liver function and coagulation, as
             assessed by the standard laboratory test results

          -  Women of reproductive potential must have a negative serum beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin (beta HCG) pregnancy test obtained within 7 days before the start of
             anetumab ravtansine. Women not of reproductive potential are female subjects who are
             postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy,

             administration of the last study drug. The investigator or a designated associate
             should advise the subject how to achieve adequate contraception. Due to the lack of
             adequate reproductive toxicity data on anetumab ravtansine, subjects must
             concomitantly use 2 forms of adequate contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have a history or current evidence of bleeding disorder within 4 weeks
             before the start of anetumab ravtansine.

          -  Subjects who have new or progressive brain or meningeal or spinal metastases.

          -  Subjects who have QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) &gt;480 ms, or heart rate
             &gt;/=100 bpm, or LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) &lt;50%, or a history or
             current evidence of uncontrolled cardiovascular disease.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Subjects who had a major surgery or significant trauma within 4 weeks before the
             start of anetumab ravtansine.

          -  Subjects who have had organ allograft or hematopoietic transplantation.

             other antigen.

          -  Subjects who have a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or an
             active hepatitis B or C virus infection requiring treatment.

          -  Subjects with a non-healing serious wound, ulcer, or bone fracture unrelated to the
             primary tumor.

          -  Subjects with corneal epitheliopathy or any eye disorder that may predispose the
             subjects to drug-induced corneal epitheliopathy.

          -  Subjects who have received systemic antitumor therapy or radiotherapy to target
             lesions within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine

          -  Subjects who have unresolved CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
             v4.03) Grade &gt;1 toxicity of previous anticancer therapy.

          -  Subjects who have received G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(s)), or
             GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage-stimulating factor(s)), or erythropoietin-stimulating
             agents within 3 weeks before the start of screening.

          -  Subjects who have received chemotherapy with anthracycline agents at the cumulative
             dose of 550 mg/m2.

          -  Subjects who have received any investigational drug treatment outside of this study
             within 4 weeks before the start of anetumab ravtansine.

          -  Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers oral or parenteral
             anticoagulation therapy started within 2 weeks before the start of anetumab
             ravtansine until the EoT (end of treatment) visit.
