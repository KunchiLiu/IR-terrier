      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab when given
      together with cisplatin and intensity-modulated radiation therapy, in treating patients with
      stage III-IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells
      and shrink tumors. Giving pembrolizumab with cisplatin and intensity-modulated radiation
      therapy may work better in treating patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination of pembrolizumab
      and standard, adjuvant cisplatin-radiotherapy in patients with high-risk, human
      papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), based upon
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe 1-year disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), local-regional
      failure (LRF), and rate of distant metastases following treatment with adjuvant
      cisplatin-radiotherapy and pembrolizumab.

      II. To describe the toxicity of the combination of cisplatin-radiotherapy and pembrolizumab
      according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 4,
      including immune-related adverse events (AEs).

      III. To describe the relationship between baseline programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      expression 1-year disease-free survival (DFS).

      IV. To describe baseline immune-inflammatory biomarkers in both tumor and tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TILs), and correlate them with 1-year DFS.

      V. To describe baseline and change in expression of peripheral immune-inflammatory
      biomarkers, including a panel of candidate tumor antigen (TA)-specific memory T cells, and
      correlate with 1-year DFS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours once weekly for weeks 1-6 and
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks in weeks 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21. Patients also
      undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in weeks 1-6. Patients may also receive
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes in weeks 3, 6, 24, and 27.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18,
      21, 24, 30, and 36.

          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of head and neck
             squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) involving the oral cavity (excluding lips),
             oropharynx (p16 negative), hypopharynx or larynx

          -  Patients must have undergone gross total surgical resection of high-risk oral cavity,
             oropharynx (p16 negative), larynx, or hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
             within 63 days prior to registration; Note: Patients may have a biopsy under general
             anesthesia in an operating room followed by definitive ablative cancer surgery
             representing gross total resection; the gross total resection has to be done within
             63 days prior to registration; if, however, patients have ablative resection but
             demonstrate rapid gross recurrence or are determined to have gross persisting disease
             requiring re-resection to achieve gross total resection, then the patient is not
             eligible

          -  Patients must have at least one of the following high risk pathologic features:

               -  Extracapsular nodal extension

               -  Invasive cancer at the primary tumor resection margin (tumor on ink); Note:
                  Patients who have a positive margin and undergo re-resection with final negative
                  margin are eligible only if they can be enrolled within 63 days of initial gross
                  total resection AND extracapsular nodal extension was also present; patients who
                  have a positive margin and undergo re-resection with final negative margin and
                  do not have extracapsular nodal extension, are NOT eligible

          -  Pathologic stage III or IV HNSCC, including no distant metastases, based on the
             following minimum diagnostic workup:

               -  General history/physical examination by a radiation oncologist and/or medical
                  oncologist within 84 days prior to registration

                  surgery; a laryngopharyngoscopy (mirror and/or fiberoptic and/or direct
                  procedure), if appropriate, is recommended but not required; intra-operative
                  examination is acceptable documentation

                  84 days prior to surgery; Note: This imaging data (diagnostic pre-operative scan
                  showing gross disease) is to be submitted in Digital Imaging and Communications
                  in Medicine (DICOM) format via transfer of images and data (TRIAD); the report
                  is to be uploaded into Rave

                  or without contrast) that includes the chest within 120 days prior to
                  registration ; Note: if the CT/PET with or without contrast is done within 84

                  (p.o.) and still within, the required registration timeframe, then the patient
                  is eligible
