    <measure>Proportion of subjects rated a &quot;treatment success&quot; based on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA score is a static evaluation of the overall or &quot;average&quot; degree of severity taking into account all of the subject's psoriatic lesions in the Treatment Area by the investigator or designee. This evaluation takes into consideration the three individual characteristics of psoriasis (scaling, erythema and plaque elevation) with the IGA score at each visit representing the average of scaling, erythema or plaque elevation that is present amongst all of the lesions eligible for treatment. IGA will be assessed on a 5-point scale where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of subjects rated a &quot;treatment success&quot; for each of the clinical signs of psoriasis (scaling, erythema and plaque elevation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Scaling, erythema and plaque elevation will each be scored on a 5-point scale where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. These evaluations are an assessment of the overall or &quot;average&quot; degree of each of three key characteristics present within all of the subject's psoriatic lesions in the Treatment Area by the investigator or designee.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in pruritus score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>At the Baseline Visit, prior to the first application of the test article, the subject's overall experience of pruritus within the previous two (2) weeks will be assessed using a questionnaire that assesses the degree, duration, direction, disability, and distribution of the subject's pruritus. At Day 15, the overall experience of pruritus, in the previous two weeks, will be scored using the same questionnaire.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in percent BSA with active psoriasis in the Treatment Area</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The percent (%) BSA with active psoriasis in the Treatment Area will be determined at the Baseline Visit and Week 2 (Day 15) and documented. At Baseline, the percent BSA with active psoriasis in the Treatment Area must be 2% to 12%, inclusive.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is male or non-pregnant female and is at least 18 years of age at the time of
             the Screening Visit.

          3. Subject is willing and able to apply the test article(s) as directed, comply with
             study instructions and commit to all follow-up visits for the duration of the study.

          4. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of stable plaque psoriasis involving a minimum of 2%
             and no more than 12% body surface area (BSA) (excluding the face, scalp, groin,
             axillae and other intertriginous areas).

          5. Subject has an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least three (3 =
             moderate) at the Baseline Visit.

          6. Females must be post-menopausal , surgically sterile or use an effective method of
             birth control , with a negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) at the Baseline Visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has spontaneously improving or rapidly deteriorating plaque psoriasis.

          2. Subject has guttate, pustular, erythrodermic or other non-plaque forms of psoriasis.

          3. Subject has a physical condition which, in the investigator's opinion, might impair
             evaluation of plaque psoriasis, or which exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk
             by study participation.

          4. Subject has used any phototherapy (including laser), photo-chemotherapy or other
             forms of photo based therapy for the treatment of their psoriasis within 30 days
             prior to the Baseline Visit.

          5. Subject has used any systemic methotrexate, retinoids, systemic corticosteroids
             [including intralesional, intra-articular, and intramuscular corticosteroids],
             cyclosporine or analogous products within 90 days prior to the Baseline Visit.

          6. Subject has used any systemic biologic therapy (i.e., FDA-approved or experimental
             therapy) within five (5) half-lives of the biologic prior to the Baseline Visit.
             Published or documented half-life of the product provided by the commercial supplier
             or Sponsor should be used to establish this value.

          7. Subject had prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet

             modify the subject's disease.

          8. Subject has used topical body (excluding the scalp) psoriasis therapy (including coal
             tar, anthralin, steroids, retinoids and vitamin D analogs) within 14 days prior to
             the Baseline Visit.

          9. Subject has used emollients/moisturizers on areas to be treated within four hours
             prior to clinical evaluation at the Baseline Visit.

         10. Subject is currently using lithium or Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine).

         11. Subject is currently using a beta-blocking medication (e.g., propranolol) or

             in the opinion of the investigator.
