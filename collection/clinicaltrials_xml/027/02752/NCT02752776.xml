    <description>All patients are scheduled to receive s.c. injections of secukinumab 300 mg at Week 0, 1, 2 and 3 during the first 4 weeks followed by monthly maintenance dosing of 300 mg secukinumab starting at Week 4 until Week 48. Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response up to 16 weeks of treatment (e.g. patients who did not achieve a PASI 50 response). If discontinued, patients will complete the end of study visit assessments. Some patients with an initially partial response (e.g.
patients who achieve a PASI 50 response but not a PASI 75 response) may subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks.</description>
