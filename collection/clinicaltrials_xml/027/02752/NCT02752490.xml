  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if a strategy of indicated compared to liberal
      oxygen administration in labor decreases the rate of cesarean delivery. The hypothesis is
      that women who undergo a strategy of indicated compared to liberal oxygen administration in
      labor will have lower rate of cesarean delivery and fetal acidemia at birth.

      This is a single-site before and after study comparing the strategy of liberal versus
      indicated use of maternal oxygen in the first and second stages of labor in the setting of a
      category 2 fetal heart rate tracing (FHR) tracing, as defined by American Congress of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and National Institute of Child Health and Human
      Development (NICHD) guidelines. All patients who are at term and are undergoing labor at
      Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas during the time frame of the study will be
      included in the study. The study will be conducted over 18 weeks. It will involve two 8 week
      time periods during which all patients will under either a strategy of liberal
      administration of oxygen use (current practice) in the &quot;before&quot; portion of the study and
      indicated administration of oxygen in the &quot;after&quot; portion of the study (new practice). There
      will be a transition period where training, education, and audit + feedback will be done to
      prepare for a strategy of indicated administration of oxygen.
