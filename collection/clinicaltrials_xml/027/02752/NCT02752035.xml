    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy superiority of ASP2215 and/or ASP2215
      plus azacitidine versus azacitidine as measured by overall survival (OS) and event-free
      survival.

    <textblock>
      Subjects considered an adult according to local regulation at the time of obtaining informed
      consent may participate in the study.

      Safety Cohort Prior to initiation of the randomized trial, 8 to 12 subjects will be enrolled
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP2215 given with azacitidine therapy in the
      study population.

      Randomized Trial Approximately 528 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive
      ASP2215 (Arm A), ASP2215 plus azacitidine (Arm AC) or azacitidine only (Arm C).

      Subjects will enter the screening period up to 14 days prior to the start of treatment.
      Subjects will be administered treatment over 28-day cycles.
