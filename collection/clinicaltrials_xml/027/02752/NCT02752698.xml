    <textblock>
      Central South University in collaboration with Tianjin University developed the first
      domestically produced Chinese minimally invasive surgical (MIS) robot system which named
      &quot;Micro Hand S&quot; in 2013. Recently, as the domestic surgical robot research project's main
      section, this new MIS robot had been authorized to enter the clinical trial stage by the
      Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital at Central South University.

      One surgeon perform these surgical trials using the robot &quot;Micro Hand S&quot;. All of the
      patients were followed for 1 months, and pre- and postoperative changes in blood route test
      and hepatorenal function examination, surgery duration, hospital stay, total robotic setup
      time, total robotic operation time, intraoperative blood loss, total postoperative drainage
      amount, duration of bearing drainage tubes were recorded.
