      This single-arm study will enroll children (less than [&lt;] 12 years of age) and adolescents
      (12 to 17 years of age) with hemophilia A and FVIII inhibitors who are currently receiving
      treatment with bypassing agents. Participants will receive weekly subcutaneous (SC) doses of
      emicizumab for a designated period of 52 weeks. All participants will continue to receive
      standard of care/background treatment with their usual episodic bypassing agent therapy to
      treat breakthrough bleeds as needed.
