  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increased availability of next-generation sequencing, oncologists are starting to
      incorporate genomic profiling into routine care of cancer patients. If a genomic alteration
      is identified during profiling, it could help guide the choice of therapy and improve
      treatment outcomes. This study will examine the anti-tumor activity of two FDA-approved
      therapies to treat patients who were previously profiled with next-generation sequencing
      technology and who failed first-line treatment for one of the following tumor types:
      non-small cell lung cancers; urothelial cancer; non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and
      upper aerodigestive tract cancer.

      This pilot study will evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of two FDA-approved targeted
      therapies, regorafenib (Stivarga, Bayer) and afatinib (Gilotrif, Boehringer Ingelheim) in
      patients who have either failed first-line treatment, or for which no standard treatment is
      available, for one of the following four tumor types:

        1. non-small cell lung cancer,

        2. urothelial carcinoma,

        3. non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and

        4. upper aerodigestive tract cancers (lip, tongue, salivary glands, gum, mouth, oral
           cavity, tonsils, oropharynx, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, sinus, and larynx tumors).

      Approximately 160 patients (40 per tumour type) are planned for enrollment. Consideration
      for enrollment will be based on results from profiling with next-generation sequencing
      technology that was performed outside of the protocol. Eligible patients will receive one of
      the FDA-approved targeted agents at the recommended dose. The treating physician will decide
      which targeted agent to prescribe based on the genomic alterations per tumor type and the
      targets listed in the package insert for each agent.
