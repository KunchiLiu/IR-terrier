  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UX023-CL205 is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study in children from 1 to 4 years old
      with XLH to assess the safety, PD, and efficacy of KRN23 administered via subcutaneous (SC)
      injections every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a total of 64 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll approximately 10 pediatric subjects between 1 and 4 years old,
      inclusive, with a confirmed diagnosis of XLH and radiographic evidence of rickets. Subjects
      will discontinue oral phosphate and active vitamin D therapy after initial Screening and for
      the duration of the study.

      All subjects will receive treatment with KRN23. Safety, PD, pre-dose KRN23 concentrations,
      and efficacy measures (rickets, growth, functional outcomes) will be evaluated throughout
      the study. Radiographs will be taken to assess rickets periodically throughout the study
      duration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged â‰¥1 year and &lt;5 years

          2. Diagnosis of XLH supported by ONE or more of the following

               -  Confirmed PHEX mutation in the patient or a directly related family member with
                  appropriate X-linked inheritance

               -  Serum FGF23 level &gt; 30 pg/mL by Kainos assay

          3. Biochemical findings associated with XLH including:

               -  Serum phosphorus &lt; 3.0 mg/dL (0.97 mmol/L)

               -  Serum creatinine within age-adjusted normal range

          4. Radiographic evidence of rickets

          5. Willing to provide access to prior medical records for the collection of historical
             growth, biochemical, and radiographic data and disease history

          6. Provide written informed consent by a legally authorized representative after the
             nature of the study has been explained, and prior to any research-related procedures

          7. Must, in the opinion of the investigator, be willing and able to complete all aspects
             of the study, adhere to the study visit schedule, and comply with the assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unwilling to stop treatment with oral phosphate and/or pharmacologic vitamin D
             metabolite or analog (e.g. calcitriol, alfacalcidol) during the screening period and
             for the duration of the study

          2. Planned or recommended orthopedic surgery including staples, 8-plates or osteotomy,
             within the clinical trial period

          3. Hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia, defined as serum calcium levels outside the
             age-adjusted normal limits

          4. Presence or history of any condition that, in the view of the investigator, places
             the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study

          5. Presence of a concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study
             participation or affect safety

          6. History of recurrent infection or predisposition to infection, or of known
             immunodeficiency

          7. Use of any investigational product or investigational medical device within 30 days
             prior to screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion
             of all scheduled study assessments
