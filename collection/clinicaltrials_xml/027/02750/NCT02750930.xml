  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Albiglutide has been developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as an
      adjunct to diet and exercise, as monotherapy, or in combination with existing therapies and
      has been approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European
      Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory agencies. This is a 26 week, open-label, single
      group, multicenter, extension study to Study 200952. This extension study will provide
      extended safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data for the albiglutide liquid drug
      product. This extension study will comprise 2 study periods: treatment (26 weeks) and
      post-treatment follow-up (8 weeks). A maximum of 300 subjects will be eligible to take part
      in this extension study.

    <measure>Number of subjects with any adverse events (AEs) and any serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 34 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects with physical examination abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 34 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A full physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessment of the skin (including injection site), head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, thyroid, respiratory system cardiovascular system, abdomen (liver and spleen), lymph nodes, central nervous system and extremities. Brief physical examination includes evaluation of skin (including injection site), respiratory system, cardiovascular system, abdomen (liver, spleen), and central nervous system. Weight will be measured at each clinic visit.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure as a measure of safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 34 Weeks</time_frame>
