      The overall aim of this proposed research is to determine the safety, feasibility and
      efficacy (AP vs at home use of SAP) of the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) controller in day and
      night closed-loop control in young children 5-8 years old with type 1 diabetes over multiple
      48 hours in an out-patient setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) in the age range of 5-8 years old are a population
      with clear needs but unique challenges regarding the application of artificial pancreas (AP)
      technologies. Young children are likely to benefit from an AP system, with current deficits
      in glycemic control that include both significant hypoglycemia and sub-optimal HbA1c levels;
      however, they have undeveloped abilities to control and interact with the AP system, posing
      potential safety issues. During the hours that these children are away from their parents at
      school and elsewhere, they lack the sophistication to operate the currently-available tools
      in an AP system--and may induce harm if they are allowed to do so, causing parental
      resistance to AP use. Commercially-available insulin pumps have mechanisms to lock access to
      children to prevent inappropriate insulin-delivery. However, the AP is more complex than an
      insulin pump, both in requiring more detailed setting information (that a child could
      adversely alter) and in providing alerts for impending low- and high-blood glucose (BG)
      levels (that one wouldn't want to lock out to child use). These functions are all run via a
      platform on a smart phone—a device with which young children may already feel a high degree
      of familiarity and thus be more likely to attempt to explore and potentially change
      settings. It is likely that young children will benefit the most from a system that gives
      them access to some AP features but provides access to other features only for their
      parents. In this sense, young children require a device that is not user-centered as much as
      family-centered. A redesign of the system to provide appropriate access to AP tools—in which
      certain users can obtain access to certain functionalities—is direly needed before children
      in this age range can benefit from the improvements in blood glucose (BG) control that the
      AP has to offer.

    <description>In this randomized, cross-over study, the intervention involves blood glucose control using a Closed Loop system run by the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) during a stay at a Research House/Hotel. All subjects will have blood glucose data compared between their usual diabetes care (at home, using home insulin pump) and this Closed-Loop care (at Research House/Hotel using the DiAs system). Subjects who are randomized to Group A will have home care evaluated before the Research House/Hotel admission. Subjects in this arm will participate in CGM training and data collection prior to the Research House/Hotel admission.</description>

    <description>Group B is identical to Group A with the exception that usual diabetes care (at home, using home insulin pump) will be evaluated after the Research House/Hotel admission. Subjects who are randomized to Group B will participate in CGM training and data collection after to the Research House/Hotel admission. As with Group A, all subjects will use Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) with Closed-Loop during the admission.</description>
