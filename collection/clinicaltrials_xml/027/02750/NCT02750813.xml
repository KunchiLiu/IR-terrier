      The purpose of this study is to compare the lens fit characteristics, specifically lens
      centration, of ACUVUE® OASYS® 1-DAY (AO1D) contact lenses and DAILIES TOTAL1® (DT1) contact
      lenses.

             every day, or at least 5 days per week, 6 hours per day;

          -  Symptoms of contact lens discomfort as defined by the Symptomatology (Eligibility)
             Pre-screening questionnaire;

          -  Prescription within -1.00 Diopter (D) to -6.00D to be fitted with study contact
             lenses;

          -  Cylinder equal or lower than -0.75D in both eyes;

          -  Vision correctable to 20/25 or 0.1 logMAR (Logarithmic minimum angle of resolution)
             or better in each eye at distance with both study lenses at Visit 1;

          -  Can be successfully fitted with both study lenses;

             would contraindicate contact lens wear;

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated as determined by the Investigator;

          -  Monocular (only 1 eye with functional vision) or fit with only 1 lens;

          -  Fitted with monovision;

          -  Prior refractive surgery;
