  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will prospectively determine the clinical utility of CMV cell-mediated immunity
      using the Quantiferon test. The investigators will use the assay results to tailor the
      duration of CMV prophylaxis in solid organ transplant patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is an important cause of morbidity in solid organ
      transplantation recipients and remains the most common opportunistic viral infection in
      these patients. Standard CMV prevention strategies include universal prophylaxis and
      pre-emptive therapy with viral load monitoring. However, neither of these strategies has
      been successful in eliminating CMV disease as seen by high rates of viremia, incidence, and
      CMV recurrence despite treatment. Recently, the Quantiferon-CMV assay has been shown to
      predict late CMV reactivation after prophylaxis and to be predictive of viral progression
      and the need for antiviral therapy in organ transplant recipients who develop low level CMV
      viremia. The purpose of the current study is to test the clinical strategy of using the
      Quantiferon-CMV assay in guiding the duration of primary CMV prophylaxis in solid organ
      transplant patients.
