      The goal of this clinical research study is to collect data about the long term safety and
      tolerability of ruxolitinib when given to patients with MF.

    <textblock>
      If participant agrees to take part in this study, they will continue to receive ruxolitinib
      as prescribed in Study 2007-0169. In addition, participant will have study visits (described
      below) to help researchers collect data about any side effects they may be having and what
      effect, if any, ruxolitinib is having on them and/or the disease.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days. Participant will take ruxolitinib tablets by mouth with a cup
      of water (about 8 ounces) either 1 or 2 times each day. Participant will continue to receive
      ruxolitinib at the same dose and schedule that they were assigned in Study 2007-0169. The
      study staff will remind participant to which schedule they have been assigned.

      Participant will also be given a study drug diary to write down when they take each dose of
      ruxolitinib and if they miss or vomit any doses. Participant should bring this diary with
      them to each clinic visit at MD Anderson.

      Study Visits:

      At every visit, participant will be asked about any side effects they may be having and
      about any new drugs (over-the-counter drugs, prescription drugs, and/or herbal/dietary
      supplements) that they take or are planning to take.

      Every 6 cycles (± 30 days):

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will complete 2 questionnaires about their quality of life. They should
           take about 10 minutes to complete.

      Every 3 cycles, participant will be called by the study doctor or a member of the study
      staff and asked about any side effects that they may be having and to answer any questions
      that they might have about the study. This call should last about 10 minutes.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so on) (+/- 14
      days), blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Participant may choose
      to have these blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic closer to their home. The
      results of this testing will then be sent to the study doctor at MD Anderson. The study
      doctor will discuss this option with participant.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue taking ruxolitinib for as long as the doctor thinks it is in their
      best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.

      Patient's participation on the study will be over after follow-up.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      As soon as possible after participant's last dose of study drug, if the doctor thinks it is
      needed:

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have a complete physical exam.

        -  Participant will complete the 2 questionnaires about their quality of life.

      This is an investigational study. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat MF. It is considered investigational to collect data about the long-term effects of
      ruxolitinib. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 14 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
