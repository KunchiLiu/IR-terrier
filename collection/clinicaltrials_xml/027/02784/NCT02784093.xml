  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal impaction (FI) is a common cause of lower gastrointestinal tract obstruction, and it
      is the result of chronic or severe constipation and most commonly found in the elderly
      population. Gastrografin is a water soluble contrast mediate that is used as a radiologic
      contrast agent and may be administered orally or rectally. It has been shown to confer a
      therapeutic beneﬁt in adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO). The investigators speculate
      that gastrografin given enterally may be more effective than enema in the treatment of fecal
      impaction induced intestinal obstruction.

             large amount of hard stool (impacted faecaloma) in colon or rectum; abdominal
             radiography was performed for assessment.

          2. Rome III criteria for chronic constipation present for ≥8 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:
