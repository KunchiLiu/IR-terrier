      Ultrasound (US) B mode image is an alternative method to measure tissue structure and has
      proven to be an accurate technique to measure subcutaneous fat thickness. However, pressing
      the transducer onto the skin with too much force will significantly reduce the subcutaneous
      adipose tissue thickness. In this study, a force controlled system combined with US
      transducer was used for 3D subcutaneous fat imaging and reconstruction.

      The diagnosis of fatty liver (steatosis) is made when fat in the liver exceeds 5-10% by
      weight. Fatty liver (FL) is commonly associated with alcohol or metabolic syndrome
      (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia), but can also be due to any one of many
      causes. Most people were detected from serum lipid abnormalities in the physical
      examination, and confirmed as the fatty liver disease by ultrasound imaging. In some
      previous studies, ultrasound was reported to provide an accurate and reliable measurement
      tool for the thickness measurements of subcutaneous adipose tissue. This method can overcome
      some limitations of the skinfold thickness measurements. Ultrasound (US) B mode image is an
      alternative method to measure tissue structure and has proven to be an accurate technique to
      measure subcutaneous fat thickness. However, pressing the transducer onto the skin with too
      much force will significantly reduce the subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness. In this
      study, a force controlled system combined with US transducer was used for 3D subcutaneous
      fat imaging and reconstruction. Finally, the correlations between body fat percentage and
      subcutaneous fat in steatosis patients have been investigated. The body fat percentage was
      determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, GE Lunar iDXA canner) and
      bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA, Omronï¼ŒHBF-370), and then, the correlation between
      body fat percentage and subcutaneous adipose tissue in normal and steatosis patients have
      been evaluated.
