      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of negotiating self determination to
      reduce cigarette consumption. A single-blinded multi-centre randomized controlled is
      employed.

      Introduction:

      A brief intervention with a small to moderate effect size can potentially benefit a large
      number of smokers and increase smoking cessation within the community if it is carried out
      routinely in clinical practices by all or most healthcare professionals or people with
      minimal training. It is also the most cost-effective smoking cessation programme, because no
      extra or minimal funding is needed to provide the venue, manpower, and other expenses (but
      incentives or payments to healthcare professionals and follow-up support would be needed).
      There is no evidence that longer interventions are more effective than shorter
      interventions. Brief cessation interventions have been shown to be effective with strong
      evidence from the investigators' randomised controlled trials and in systematic reviews.

      The negotiating self-determination to reduce cigarette consumption is guided by social
      cognitive and self-determination theories. According to social cognitive theory,
      self-efficacy is an important personal determinant of human behaviour and has been defined
      as the belief in one's capability to engage in behaviour to solve difficult tasks. This
      belief influences decisions on whether a certain form of behaviour will be adopted and
      maintained. Because self-efficacy is built on a successful experience of overcoming
      challenging tasks, smokers who have more successful experiences in reducing cigarette
      consumption tend to have higher levels of self-efficacy. Some evidence has shown that a
      reduction in smoking may lead to greater self-efficacy to resist smoking, which could
      increase subsequent quitting. According to self-determination theory, autonomy is another
      influential determinant of behaviours which is emphasized by freedom of choice. Studies have
      shown that patients having an opportunity to decide on their own treatment may feel more
      eager to comply with instructions. The subjects in this study will be allowed to select
      their own schedules of smoking reduction after the negotiation with the counsellor, such as
      the percentage of smoking reduction over an acceptable period of time. It is anticipated
      that the subjects will show more willingness to adhere to their own schedule as a result of
      an increase in autonomy. Moreover, some evidence has shown that autonomy is positively
      associated with competence; that is, people have greater autonomy demonstrate higher
      competence in achieving behavioural change. Consequently, autonomy will facilitate their
      gradual reduction or cessation of smoking. Most importantly, as a result of reducing the
      cigarette consumption and lowering down the nicotine dependence, it would be much easier for
      such smokers to further reduce or quit.

      Methods:

      Chinese patients attending the general out-patient clinics in Hong Kong for routine
      follow-up visits who fulfil the following inclusion criteria will be invited to participate
      in the study.

      All smoking patients will be approached by the research assistants or counsellors. The
      screening process can allow the investigators to find out smokers who want to quit and
      smokers who want to reduce smoking.

      Analysis:

      Data analysis will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science. The
      investigators will compare the baseline characteristics of the patients by x2 test for
      categorical variables and F-test for continuous variables between the intervention and the
      control group. The investigators shall use the x2 test to assess the effect of intervention
      and calculate the crude odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the primary
      and secondary outcomes. The investigators shall conduct intention to treat (ITT) analysis
      for evaluation of effectiveness.

    <description>Subjects in the QI group will receive a smoking cessation leaflet plus a brief intervention using the AWARD model: (a) Ask about smoking history, (b) Warn about the high risk, (c) Advise to quit now, as quitting can greatly reduce risks, (d) Refer smokers to a smoking cessation clinic, and (e) Do it again: repeat the intervention during each telephone follow-up. For the warning message, the counsellor will repeat the following in a standardized manner: 'The World Health Organization says that based on medical research, one out of two smokers will be killed by smoking. This 50% risk is very high. The participants should decide to quit smoking as this is good for them.' The whole intervention will be limited to less than 1 min or slightly longer if necessary.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the CDTQ group and report no intention to quit smoking less than 7 days, will receive a smoking reduction leaflet (include a roadmap of smoking reduction strategy) plus a brief intervention using the AWARD model similar to QI group. For the warning message, the counsellor will deliver the following message in a standardized manner: 'The World Health Organization says that based on medical research, one out of two smokers will be killed by smoking. The participants should decide to reduce and then quit smoking as this is good for them.' The whole intervention will be limited to less than 1 min or slightly longer if necessary.</description>
