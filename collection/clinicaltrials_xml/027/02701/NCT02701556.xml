      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NNR06
      Multi-Purpose Solution cleaning and disinfecting solution (Test) compared to COMPLETE
      Multi-Purpose Solution cleaning and disinfecting solution (Control) when used by habitual
      contact lens wearers to bilaterally clean and disinfect their contact lenses for
      approximately three months.

      Approximately 398 subjects (796 eyes) will be enrolled in this three-month controlled,
      parallel group, masked, randomized study at approximately 22 investigative sites in the
      United States (US). Approximately one-half of the subjects will be randomized to receive
      Bausch &amp; Lomb investigational NNR06 Multi-Purpose Solution to be used with a rub care
      regimen (Test), and approximately one-half of the subjects will be randomized to receive
      COMPLETE Multi-Purpose Solution with a rub care regimen (Control).
