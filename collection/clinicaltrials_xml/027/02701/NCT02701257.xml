  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two different models of a wearable bionic pancreas device (the
      iPhone-based bionic pancreas vs. the iLet bionic pancreas) in adult participant with type 1
      diabetes. Both bionic pancreas devices measure glucose levels every five minutes and then
      give insulin and/or glucagon automatically to regulate the blood glucose (BG). The iPhone
      bionic pancreas has been used in earlier studies, during which volunteers used the system
      for up to 11 days at a time while living their normal lives at home and work. The iLet
      bionic pancreas has never been tested in humans. In this new study, volunteers will
      participate in a training visit to learn how both devices work. They will then use the
      iPhone-based BP for 1 day and the iLet BP for 1 day in random order using Lilly glucagon.
      They will then use the iLet BP for one additional day using Xeris Xerisol glucagon (a stable
      formulation of human glucagon).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years and have had clinical type 1 diabetes for at least one year

          -  Diabetes managed using an insulin pump for ≥ 6 months

          -  Prescription medication regimen stable for &gt; 1 month (except for medications that
             will not affect the safety of the study and are not expected to affect any outcome of
             the study, in the judgment of the principal investigator)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to provide informed consent (e.g. impaired cognition or judgment)

          -  Unable to safely comply with study procedures and reporting requirements (e.g.
             impairment of vision or dexterity that prevents safe operation of the bionic
             pancreas, impaired memory, unable to speak and read English)

          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the
             judgment of the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or
             the safety of the subject

          -  Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the
             immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception

          -  Current alcohol abuse (intake averaging &gt; 3 drinks daily in last 30 days), use of
             marijuana within 1 month of enrollment, or other substance abuse (use within the last
             6 months of controlled substances other than marijuana without a prescription)

          -  Unwilling or unable to refrain on the study days from:

               -  acetaminophen in any form

               -  use of marijuana

               -  use of drugs that may dull the sensorium, reduce sensitivity to symptoms of
                  hypoglycemia, or hinder decision making during the period of participation in
                  the study (use of beta blockers will be allowed as long as the dose is stable
                  and the subject does not meet the criteria for hypoglycemia unawareness while
                  taking that stable dose, but use of benzodiazepines or narcotics, even if by
                  prescription, may be excluded according to the judgment of the principal
                  investigator)

          -  History of liver disease that is expected to interfere with the anti-hypoglycemia
             action of glucagon (e.g. liver failure or cirrhosis). Other liver disease (i.e.
             active hepatitis, steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver,
             hemochromatosis, glycogen storage disease) may exclude the subject if it causes
             significant compromise to liver function or may do so in an unpredictable fashion.

          -  Renal failure on dialysis

          -  Personal history of cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, pancreatic tumor, or any other
             pancreatic disease besides type 1 diabetes

          -  Any known history of coronary artery disease including, but not limited to, history
             of myocardial infarction, stress test showing ischemia, history of angina, or history
             of intervention such as coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary
             intervention, or enzymatic lysis of a presumed coronary occlusion)

          -  Congestive heart failure (established history of CHF, lower extremity edema,
             paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea)

          -  History of TIA or stroke

          -  Seizure disorder, history of any non-hypoglycemic seizure within the last two years,
             or ongoing treatment with anticonvulsants

          -  History of hypoglycemic seizures (grand-mal) or coma in the last year

          -  History of pheochromocytoma: fractionated metanephrines will be tested in patients
             with history increasing the risk for a catecholamine secreting tumor:

               -  Episodic or treatment refractory (requiring 4 or more medications to achieve
                  normotension) hypertension

               -  Paroxysms of tachycardia, pallor, or headache

               -  Personal or family history of MEN 2A, MEN 2B, neurofibromatosis, or von
                  Hippel-Lindau disease

          -  History of adrenal disease or tumor

          -  Hypertension with systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 despite treatment

          -  Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness (indicators would include symptoms
             such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and any psychiatric hospitalization in the
             last year), or treatment with anti-psychotic medications that are known to affect
             glucose regulation.

          -  Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might
             be susceptible to RF interference

          -  History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and
             vomiting

          -  Established history of allergy or severe reaction to adhesive or tape that must be
             used in the study

          -  Use of oral (e.g. thiazolidinediones, biguanides, sulfonylureas, glitinides, DPP-4
             inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors) anti-diabetic medications
