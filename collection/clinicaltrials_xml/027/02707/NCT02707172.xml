    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness in removing chemical exposure on hand,
      we compare removal efficiency of Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) on hands by hand washing
      with soap and water vs. water only. In two three-day N-of-1 trials, residual DEHP was
      measured in a single female adult who washed exposed hands with soap-and-water or
      water-only. Subsequently, a crossover study was performed by randomly assigning another 28
      subjects equally to wash with soap-and-water or with water-only, and then each one received
      the other treatment 24 hrs later.

      Three studies, consisting of two N-of-1 trials and one crossover study, were used to compare
      the effect of handwashing with soap and water (intervention) and handwashing with water only
      (placebo) on phthalate removal from hands. The soap was plain soap, consisting of vegetable
      oil and sodium hydroxide. First, we recruited one healthy female aged 25 yrs to participate
      in two N-of-1 trials. In each trial, her hands would be exposed to DEHP and then be treated
      with either soap intervention or placebo for three times over the course of three days. The
      first trial started on 15 May 2013. On day one, after the subject prewashed her hands, she
      allowed her hands to be exposed to a designated amount of DEHP. She then washed them with
      water only and rinsed them sequentially in three separate polyethylene (PE) bags, each
      containing 200 mL water to collect DEHP residue. One hour later, the same protocol was
      followed, except the exposed hands were treated with soap and water instead of water only
      (Figure 1a). The water rinsing in three separate bags remained the same. The pairs of
      studies were repeated on two subsequent days (16 and 17 May).

      In the second N-of-1 trial, which was also performed over three days (22-24 May), the
      protocol using the same subject remained the same for all three days, except that the
      subject underwent intervention first then placebo. The water rinsing remained the same.

      A randomized 2 Ã— 2 crossover study was subsequently conducted between June and September
      2013. We assigned one group of 7 females and 7 males to perform handwashing with soap and
      water (intervention) and another group of 7 females and 7 males to perform handwashing with
      water only (placebo). Briefly, on the first day, the two groups washed their DEHP exposed
      hands using either soap and water or water only and then rinsed them in a PE bag with 200 mL
      water to collect DEHP. After 24 hrs, the experiment was crossed-over with the same two
      groups receiving the opposite treatments.
