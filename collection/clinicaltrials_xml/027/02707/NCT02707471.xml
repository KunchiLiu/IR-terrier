    <textblock>
      Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) is a crucial component of treatment used to prevent
      recurrence and reduce breast cancer-related mortality for breast cancer patients with
      hormone receptor positive disease. Studies report low rates of adherence to AET (38% to 86%)
      and in our preliminary work, 65% of breast cancer patients taking AET reported one or more
      non-adherent medication taking behaviors (e.g., skipped dose, forgot, adjusted dose) in the
      past month. Symptoms (e.g., arthralgia, vasomotor symptoms) associated with AET are strongly
      related to non-adherence and early discontinuation of treatment. Poor adherence to AET due
      to symptoms may compromise the effectiveness of AET. Prior to conducting a clinical trial,
      we will conduct user testing of the self-management intervention protocol with 20 women. In
      the proposed randomized clinical trial, 400 women who are taking AET for breast cancer will
      be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) a self-management intervention for
      improving adherence and symptom management, or 2) a general health education control
      condition. The self-management intervention integrates three key theory-based strategies for
      improving adherence to AET: coping skills training for managing symptoms (e.g., arthralgia,
      vasomotor symptoms), behavioral strategies for improving medication adherence, and symptom
      and medication education. The intervention addresses the specific symptoms a woman is
      experiencing and is designed to meet the needs of women who are at high risk for
      non-adherence to AET (e.g., low socioeconomic status, low literacy). The self-management
      intervention is administered by a nurse via the telephone, and combines the use of phone
      calls and tailored interactive voice messaging based on information exchanged during phone
      sessions and real-time adherence data obtained from smart medication bottles. Women randomly
      assigned to the control condition will receive a general health education intervention that
      is delivered by a nurse via the telephone. This study will take place in the Duke Cancer
      Institute breast clinic and in community hospitals that are members of the Duke Cancer
      Network, which will allow access to women receiving care outside the medical center setting
      and increase generalizability of findings to a variety of settings. Adherence to AET will be
      assessed over the 18 month period following study enrollment using wireless smart medication
      bottles that provide real-time adherence data. Patient-reported outcome measures assessing
      symptoms, perceived necessity of AET, concerns about AET, and self-efficacy will be obtained
      at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. To increase the likelihood of later implementation
      of the self-management intervention, the cost effectiveness of the intervention will be
      evaluated.

    <description>The SM-AET protocol includes seven sessions and three maintenance calls administered by a nurse via the phone. The intervention also includes interactive voice messaging that is tailored based on participants' medication taking behavior. Adherence to AET will be assessed using smart pill bottles (i.e., bottle opening and percent of pills remaining).</description>
