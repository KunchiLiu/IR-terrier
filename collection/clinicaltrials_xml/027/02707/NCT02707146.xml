  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project focuses on improving the patient-provider primary care visit interaction by
      addressing the need to align patient and provider priorities in a way that incorporates
      patients' goals and preferences while supporting the clinical work of their providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to enroll new and/or complex patients and their physicians
      in a 12-month randomized study. At each scheduled primary care visit during the trial
      period, Intervention Patients will be provided with a waiting room Tablet loaded with the
      &quot;Visit Planner&quot; intervention tool designed to support prioritization and discussion of top
      health care concerns. Control Patients will be given a written educational handout to
      review. Patient-centered outcomes will be obtained at baseline and after visits using
      validated survey instruments. Clinical outcomes focus on differences in quality of care. If
      successful, this approach to aligning patient and provider visit priorities can potentially
      be disseminated and adapted to a wide variety of different care settings.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients enrolled in the study will have one or more guideline-based care gaps at baseline. Care gaps are defined as: overdue for cancer screening (mammography, colorectal cancer), overdue for chronic disease monitoring (blood pressure, HbA1c), above goal for chronic disease (SBP &gt; 140, HbA1c &gt; 8%), or medication related (not prescribed a statin if clinically indicated, not prescribed medicine for osteoporosis if indicated, &lt; 80% adherence to medication for diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia), or current smoker. The investigators will assess % of patients resolving baseline clinical care gaps after 12 months. The aggregate outcome will be defined as yes/no resolution of baseline care gap. The study arms will be compared using an aggregate measure of these guideline-based clinical care gaps.</description>
