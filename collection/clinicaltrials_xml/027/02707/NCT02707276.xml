  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of Low Field Magnetic Stimulation
      (LFMS) in treating symptoms of depression and anxiety in older adults suffering from bipolar
      depression. The investigators also aim to assess any cognitive benefits from regular LFMS
      treatments in older adults suffering from bipolar depression.

      The investigators have previously observed mood improvement in participants with bipolar
      depression in a population aged 21-60. Here the investigators hope to extend these results
      to a similar but new population, geriatric bipolar depression (GPD). In addition to the
      evaluation of the effect of multiple treatments, as well as observation of the duration of
      the effect after a delay of one week in this population, the investigators will assess
      whether this population presents any noticeable difference in tolerance or effect.

      The protocol involves three treatments on consecutive days with one follow-up visit; this is
      a crossover study in which the treatments and follow-up are repeated after a one-week
      washout with the alternate (active, sham).

      The mechanisms of depression in a geriatric population may differ from those in a younger
      population. In particular, brain structures and connectivity have changed, and there is the
      increased risk of comorbid diagnoses such as dementia that might confound treatment and
      assessment. In this study the investigators hope to extend the findings of LFMS in the
      general population to directly address the treatment of bipolar depression in a geriatric
      population.

    <description>Low Field Magnetic Stimulation is an electromagnetic treatment being investigated for its effects on mood.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects will be men or women aged 55 years or older.

          2. Subjects will have a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Type I or II, current episode
             depressed as measure by a MADRS ≥ 20.

          3. Subjects must have failed at least one FDA approved treatment for bipolar depression
             before enrolling in this study. Failed treatment is defined as 8 weeks of treatment
             at standard dose (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) , Selective
             Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI), mood stabilizer, or typical or atypical
             antipsychotic).

          4. Subjects must be maintained on a stable dose of all psychotropic medications for a
             period of at least two weeks prior to screening.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects meeting Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV-TR (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for any
             Axis I disorder other than Bipolar Disorder or an anxiety disorder (eg. Major
             Depressive Disorder, dementia).

          2. Subject has an Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score ≤ 24.

          3. Subject is pregnant or plans on becoming pregnant.

          5. Subject has recent history of substance abuse (cannot meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for
             substance abuse, no significant drug abuse within last 3 months, no history of
             dependence in last year, no drug use within last month, other than marijuana use).

          6. Subject has any contraindication for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (i.e. Presence
             of a pacemaker, neurostimulator, or metal in head or neck).
