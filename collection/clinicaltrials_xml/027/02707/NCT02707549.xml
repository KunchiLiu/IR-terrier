  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid management of children during neurosurgery is not well established. Hypotonic
      solutions, commonly still used in pediatric patients, may enhance cerebral edema and worse
      operative conditions. This study compares two different isotonic solutions administered
      perioperatively regarding acid base and fluid electrolyte disturbances.

    <description>Serum chloride will be collected in two different moments: right before the beginning of the surgery and right after de end of the procedure. We will calculate the difference between the two values.</description>
