    <textblock>
      A Stepped Care pathway for managing postpartum depression (PPD) in pediatric primary care
      settings will be used to (1) understand context for implementation feasibility (2) evaluate
      benefits for mother and child.

      The proposed pilot project will be conducted as part of a quality improvement effort in the
      Department of Pediatrics at Gouverneur Health Services to improve management of postpartum
      depression during pediatric primary care visits. This project will test the feasibility of a
      stepped care approach to identifying and managing depression among mothers of infants (0-6
      months). This study will provide preliminary data on the feasibility of the care management
      protocol, implementation and fidelity measures, and training/consultation methods within a
      real world pediatric care practice. These data will inform and support the preparation of a
      large-scale NIH grant.

      Specific research questions include:

        1. To pilot the feasibility of using a Stepped Care Approach to identify and mange
           maternal depression within primary care pediatric care visits, with a focus on mothers
           of infants 0-6 months.

             1. Train non specialty MH providers to systematically identify maternal depression.

             2. Assess how effective integration of maternal depression intervention is as part of
                well baby visits.

        2. To o examine the impact of STRONG, a brief 3-session IPT-based preventive intervention,
           on maternal and child health outcomes (e.g., maternal depression symptoms, child
           receipt of acute care services). Secondary outcomes include maternal social support and
           parenting practices.
