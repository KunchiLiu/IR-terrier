  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For both intrauterine device (IUD) insertion and endometrial biopsies (EMB) currently there
      are no standardized clinical guidelines for pain management. The investigators aim to
      explore whether adequate pain relief is possible through self-administered, non-invasive
      means alone. Reducing pain associated with IUD insertion and/or EMB may benefit patients and
      providers. When patients are comfortable during their procedure, it is likely the provider
      can more quickly and with fewer complications perform the insertion and/or EMB. The
      investigators propose to explore the effect of a locally applied vaginal lidocaine gel in
      place of the standard of care pain management, no intervention, prior to IUD insertions, and
      EMB.

      They hypothesize that lidocaine gel is superior to placebo at decreasing procedural pain at
      a variety of time points throughout the procedure. This is a superiority, blinded,
      randomized controlled trial.
