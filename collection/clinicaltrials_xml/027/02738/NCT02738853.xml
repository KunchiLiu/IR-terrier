    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe aortic stenosis, defined as aortic valve area of &lt;1.0 cm2 (or aortic valve
             area index of &lt;0.6 cm2/m2) by the continuity equation, AND mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg OR
             maximal aortic valve velocity &gt;4.0 m/sec by resting echocardiogram

          2. STS score of ≥8 OR documented heart team agreement of ≥ high risk for AVR due to
             frailty or co-morbidities

          3. Symptoms of aortic stenosis AND NYHA Functional Class II or greater

          4. The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all
             required post procedure follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any condition considered a contraindication for placement of a bioprosthetic valve
             (eg, subject is indicated for mechanical prosthetic valve)

          2. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following which cannot be
             adequately pre medicated:

               -  aspirin or heparin (HIT/HITTS) and bivalirudin

               -  ticlopidine and clopidogrel

               -  nitinol (titanium or nickel)

               -  contrast media

          3. Blood dyscrasias as defined: leukopenia (WBC &lt;1000 mm3), thrombocytopenia (platelet
             count &lt;50,000 cells/mm3), history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or
             hypercoagulable states

          4. Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization

          5. Severe left ventricular dysfunction with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)

             drug eluting stent performed within 30 days prior to study procedure

             stenosis within 10 weeks of Heart Team assessment

         13. Subject refuses a blood transfusion

         14. Severe dementia (resulting in either inability to provide informed consent for the
             study/procedure, prevents independent lifestyle outside of a chronic care facility,
             or will fundamentally complicate rehabilitation from the procedure or compliance with
             follow-up visits)

         15. Estimated life expectancy of less than 12 months due to associated non-cardiac
             co-morbid conditions

         16. Other medical, social, or psychological conditions that in the opinion of the
             investigator precludes the subject from appropriate consent or adherence to the
             protocol required follow-up exams

         17. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study (excluding
             registries)

         18. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction ≤30 days before the study procedure

         19. Need for emergency surgery for any reason

         20. Liver failure (Child-Pugh class C)

         21. Subject is pregnant or breast feeding

         22. Pre existing prosthetic heart valve in any position

         23. Mixed aortic valve disease (aortic stenosis with severe aortic regurgitation)

         24. Severe mitral regurgitation

         25. Severe tricuspid regurgitation

         26. Moderate or severe mitral stenosis

         28. Echocardiographic or Multi-Slice Computed Tomography (MSCT) evidence of intracardiac
             mass, thrombus, or vegetation

         29. Congenital bicuspid or unicuspid valve verified by echocardiography
