      The purpose of this study is to test in adults with Down Syndrome the safety, tolerability
      and immunogenicity of a vaccine, ACI-24.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-center, placebo controlled, double-blind and randomized dose
      escalation study of 2 doses of ACI-24 versus Placebo over 24 months with a total of 21
      visits.

      All subjects will receive the study medication (ACI-24 or Placebo) 7 times via s.c.
      injection (12 months) and will be followed up for 12 months after the last dose with a final
      safety and efficacy assessment.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator able to fully participate in the trial and
             sufficiently proficient in English to be capable of reliably completing study

             be on stable treatment for 3 months prior to screening.)

          -  Any medical condition likely to significantly hamper the evaluation of safety of the
             study drug.

          -  DSM-IV criteria for drug or alcohol abuse or dependence currently met within the past
             five years.

             characterization as &quot;possible&quot; or &quot;definite&quot;).

          -  MRI examination cannot be done for any reason, including metal implants
