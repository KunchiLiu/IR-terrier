  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to know about the quality of life of patients with metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma who are being treated with sunitinib, pazopanib or sorafenib, and who
      suffer from fatigue and hand-foot syndrome, with personal inter-variability, and to explore
      measures that can be taken in terms of both everyday lifestyle and treatment to mitigate or
      cure such side effects that affect patients.

    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicentre, observational study in patients with metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma (mRCC) receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor as first-line treatment according to
      routine clinical practice, designed to evaluate the incidence of fatigue and hand-foot
      syndrome in order to determine how these affect the baseline characteristics of the patient
      and his/her disease (age, gender, baseline status, tumour histology, etc.) and the patient's
      lifestyle as such side effects develop.

      An exploratory analysis will be performed of measures that clinicians may adopt to improve
      patients' quality of life with regards to daytime naps, medication administration time,
      off-treatment periods, dose reductions and treatment breaks.
