  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many countries, caesarean section (CS) rates have been increasing. The international
      literature is unclear regarding the analgesic efficacy of the transversus abdominis plane
      block (TAPB) after a CS. In particular, no clinical trials exist in which the correct method
      of performing this block has been matched with the obtained analgesic effect after a CS. The
      primary goal of the study was to determine whether a correctly performed ultrasound-guided
      TAPB (USG-TAPB) could provide patients who underwent a CS with better control of acute
      postoperative pain during the first 72 hours after surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) is a regional anesthetic technique that can provide
      analgesia for lower abdominal surgical procedures. Previous meta-analyses and recently
      published clinical trials have demonstrated promising results for this technique when it is
      used as part of multimodal postoperative pain treatment, but no consensus exists regarding
      the potency of this type of anesthetic procedure for analgesia after a CS. The primary goal
      of the study was to determine whether a correctly performed ultrasound-guided TAPB
      (USG-TAPB) could provide patients who underwent a CS with better control of acute
      postoperative pain during the first 72 hours after surgery. In this study, the correct
      execution of an USG-TAPB was verified, and then the procedure was matched with the obtained
      analgesic effect after a CS.

      The secondary aims were to determine whether USG-TAPB could ensure a decline in
      postoperative requests for opiates and fewer opiate-related side effects, the return of
      faster bowel function, and shorter recovery time without generating critical hemodynamic
      changes.
