  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in
      combination with oxaliplatin/capecitabine chemotherapy in metastatic/locally advanced
      oesophageal cancer (OC) and with neoadjuvant chemo(radio)therapy before surgery in operable
      OC. The immunotherapy will be given for a 4-week period before starting the standard
      chemo(radio)therapy, continuing durvalumab treatment once the chemotherapy starts. The study
      will include 2 phases, a safety run-in Phase 1 (Cohorts A1 and A2) and an expansion Phase 2
      (Cohorts B, C, and D).

             would interfere with evaluation of study treatment, interpretation of subject safety
             or study results, prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol
             or that may put the subject at unacceptable risk.
