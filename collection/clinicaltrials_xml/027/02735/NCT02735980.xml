      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prexasertib when given
      to participants with extensive stage disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC). The study
      will evaluate how the body processes the drug and how the drug affects the body. The study
      will also evaluate the association between tumor response and the participant's perceived
      quality of life.
