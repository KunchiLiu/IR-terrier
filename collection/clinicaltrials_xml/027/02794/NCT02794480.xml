    <textblock>
      The study is conducted to evaluate the potentially improved patient handling of the ELLIPTA
      Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI). Therefore, the study aims to evaluate errors encountered by
      subject with asthma during handling ELLIPTA DPI relative to two metered dose inhalers (MDI),
      a GSK MDI and the AstraZeneca (AZ) MDI. It is a randomised, multi-centre, open-label,
      cross-over study comparing placebo ELLIPTA DPI with placebo MDI (GSK and AZ) to assess
      correct inhaler use. No active drug will be used in this study in order to prevent any
      drug-related effects. Approximately, 152 subjects will be randomized to receive ELLIPTA DPI
      inhaler and 152 will be randomized to receive one of the MDI inhalers, for use during the
      first period (P) (approximately 28 days). At Visit 2 (Day 28) all subjects previous
      receiving the ELLIPTA DPI will be randomized to receive one of the MDI inhalers and all
      subjects who received a MDI in the previous period will receive the ELLIPTA DPI for use
      during second period (approximately 28 days). Subjects will continue taking their asthma
      maintenance treatment and limited rescue albuterol MDI during the entire 56-day study
      period.

    <description>Correct Use is defined as the percentage of subjects with zero errors after 28 days of use. A checklist for correct use of each of the study medications is developed based on the steps identified in the Package Insert (PI's).
