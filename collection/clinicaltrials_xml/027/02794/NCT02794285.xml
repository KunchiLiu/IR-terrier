      This is a Phase 3, multicentre, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      extension study to characterising the long term safety and tolerability of of an intravenous
      treatment regimen of anifrolumab versus placebo in subjects with moderately to severely
      active systemic lupus erythematosus who completed a Phase 3 study (D3461C00004 or
      D3461C00005) through the 52-week double-blind treatment period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have qualified for and received investigational product (anifrolumab or
             placebo) and completed the treatment period in Studies D3461C00004 or D3461C00005
             (through Week 52)

          2. Adequate peripheral venous access

          3. Females with an intact cervix should have documentation of a Pap smear with no
             documented malignancy within 90 days before Day 1/Visit 1. Since access to a Pap
             smear may vary by country, the Sponsor recommends that local guidelines for obtaining
             Pap smears in subjects who have received immunomodulators or immunosuppressive
             treatment be followed.

          4. Meets the following TB criteria:

               1. Negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold [QFT-G] test result for TB obtained from the study
                  central laboratory at Week 52 of Studies D3461C00004 or D3461C00005; OR

               2. Newly positive QFT-G test result at Week 52 of Studies D3461C00004 or
                  D3461C00005 from the study central laboratory. A chest x-ray must be performed.
                  If the chest x-ray shows no evidence of active TB, and the subject has no
                  symptoms or medical history consistent with active TB, the subject must have a
                  retest. If the retest is positive, the subject must start on prophylaxis within
                  30 days of randomisation but prior to the second dose of investigational product
                  (Visit 2/Week 4); OR

               3. Positive but not newly positive QFT-G test at Week 52 of Studies D3461C00004 or
                  D3461C00005. The subject must have been diagnosed with latent TB and must have
                  documentation confirming initiation of appropriate treatment OR initiate
                  treatment for latent TB within 30 days of randomization, but prior to the second
                  dose of investigational product administration (Visit 2/Week 4)

               4. Newly indeterminate (confirmed on retest) or indeterminate but not newly
                  indeterminate QFT-G test result at Week 52 of Studies D3461C00004 or D3461C00005
                  from the study central laboratory with ongoing QFT-G testing for TB according to
                  the Study Plan

          5. In the opinion of the Investigator, subject must be able to comprehend the ICF and
             all protocol related assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Receipt of any of the following within the last 60 days:

               1. Azathioprine &gt;200 mg/day

               2. Mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid &gt;2.0 g/day

               3. Oral, subcutaneous, or intramuscular methotrexate &gt;25 mg/week

          2. Receipt of any investigational product (small molecule or biologic agent other than
             anifrolumab) within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives prior to Day 1/Visit 1, whichever is
             greater

          3. Receipt of any of the following:

               1. Any live or attenuated vaccine within 8 weeks prior to Day 1/Visit 1
                  (administration of killed vaccines is acceptable, the Sponsor recommends
                  Investigators ensure all subjects are up to date on required vaccinations,
                  including influenza [inactivated/recombinant] vaccine prior to study entry)

               2. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine between the end of Studies D3461C00004 or
                  D3461C00005 and Day 1/Visit 1

          4. Active severe SLE-driven renal or neuropsychiatric disease

          5. Any underlying condition that predisposes the subject to infection, including history
             of/current human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          6. Subjects with Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positivity at enrolment of Studies
             D3461C00004 or D3461C00005 will be tested every 3 months for Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
             DNA. To remain eligible in the LTE study, subject HBV DNA levels must remain below
             the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) as per the central laboratory.

          7. Opportunistic infection requiring hospitalisation or parenteral antimicrobial
             treatment within 3 years of Day 1/Visit 1
