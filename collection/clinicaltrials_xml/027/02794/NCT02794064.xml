  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast conservation surgery (BCS) is performed on patients with breast cancer with the
      intent to resect and completely remove the tumour while conserving as much of the
      surrounding normal tissue as possible. Currently, there is no way for surgeons to determine
      the adequacy of surgical resection in real-time during surgery; the assessment of surgical
      margins requires histological examination that is not available in real-time and is
      impractical in most clinical cases. This results in a re-excision rate of 23% among Canadian
      women in order to achieve optimal surgical margins. In addition, the presence or absence of
      cancer in tumor draining lymph nodes is recognized as a key element for breast cancer
      staging; however, lymph node dissection can be associated with overtreatment and morbidity
      (nerve damage and post surgical lymphedema) and histological analysis of nodes can be time
      consuming and thus delay subsequent procedures. In an effort to address these issues, we
      have designed and constructed, in collaboration with Sogang University, Seoul, S. Korea, a
      novel imaging system that performs three complementary imaging modalities (tri-modal):
      ultrasound (US), photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL).

      This first-in-human pilot study will recruit 10 breast cancer patients undergoing breast
      conserving surgery at Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto, Canada). The study is designed to
      test our tri-modal (US, PA, FL) imaging technology in breast cancer patients. The overall
      goal is to obtain initial information on the technical feasibility of the tri-modal system
      in a peri-operative setting and to confirm the anticipated safety of the procedures.
      Additionally, it will provide initial data on the ability of this system to detect/localize
      primary breast cancer lesions and cancer-involved lymph nodes prior to surgery.

    <description>This tri-modal imaging system was developed in collaboration with Sogang University and is composed of three subsystems: ultrasound, photoacoustic and fluorescence. For this study, the fluorescence subsystem will not be used. The photoacoustic and ultrasound subsystems and data acquisition are controlled by a single workstation. The complete system is Canadian Standards Association (CSA) certified</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  Pre-operative therapy for current breast cancer (including chemotherapy, endocrine
             therapy and radiotherapy)

          -  history of other previous cancer requiring therapy (including chemotherapy, endocrine
             therapy and radiotherapy) within the past 12 months

          -  History of photosensitivity, skin disease or recurrent disease

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Absence of in-house biopsy in tissue bank
