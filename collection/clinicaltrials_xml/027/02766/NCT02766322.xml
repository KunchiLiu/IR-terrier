  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to study the effects of alcohol on three forms of bariatric surgery,
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric
      banding (LAGB). The surgery is not part of the clinical trial. If insurance does not cover
      the procedure, then the patient is responsible for payment of the surgical process. The
      investigators are doing pre and post surgery testing to provide a better understanding of
      the effect of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on 1) alcohol absorption, distribution
      and elimination from the body, 2) the effects of alcohol on mood, and 3) the effects of
      alcohol on driving.

      The study includes seven groups of women: One group will be undergoing RYGB another group
      will be undergoing LAGB, a third group will be undergoing SG, the fourth group will be women
      who underwent RYGB 1-5 years ago, the fifth group will be women who underwent LAGB 1-5 years
      ago, the sixth group will be women who underwent SG 1-5 years ago, and the seventh group
      will be a control group who have not undergone bariatric surgery.

    <description>Morbidly obese subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Subjects will be assessed in four testing sessions about 1 week apart in a randomized cross-over fashion before surgery. During the first two sessions, their response to alcohol or nonalcoholic (placebo) beverage will be evaluated. During testing sessions three and four, their response to alcohol or saline solution (placebo) administered intravenously will be evaluated. These four testing sessions will be repeated ~ 9 months after surgery.</description>
