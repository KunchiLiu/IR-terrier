  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By integrating approaches from the physical, biological, computational, statistical and
      clinical sciences, this study will test the hypothesis that early diagnosis of subclinical
      signatures of critical illness encoded within physiological signals complements conventional
      clinical predictors by providing unique prognostic insight. Early diagnosis of these
      subclinical signatures may lead to earlier treatment that can save additional lives. Our
      goal is to validate predictive algorithms and identify subclinical signatures of illness,
      ranging from asymptomatic adults in the community to very sick patients in the hospital.
