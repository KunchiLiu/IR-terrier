    <time_frame>At the 1-week follow-up after 7 days of contact lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>Comfort and Vision are assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE™) Questionnaire. CLUE™ is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact lens-wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable / positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/- 3XSD).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          3. The subject must be between (and including) 18 and 39 years of age.

          4. The subject must be an adapted wearer of spherical soft contact lenses in both eyes.
             That is, the subject must wear their habitual lenses at least five (5) days per week
             and eight (8) hours per day, worn for at least 30 days immediately preceding the
             study.

          5. Have vertex-corrected distance refraction that allows a plano over-refraction with
             the available contact lens powers of -1.00 to -6.00 Diopters (D) in each eye.

          6. Have refractive astigmatism, if present, of less than or equal to 1.00 D in each eye.

          7. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding (subjects who become pregnant during the study
             will be discontinued).

          2. Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          3. Any autoimmune disease or use of medication, which may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          4. Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosions, or aphakia.

          5. Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
             photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK),
             etc.).

          6. Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          7. Any ocular infection.

          8. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          9. Monovision, multi-focal, toric, or extended wear contact lens correction.

         10. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14 days
             prior to study enrollment.

         11. History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus that is likely to affect
             successful contact lens wear.

         12. Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or contagious
             immunosuppressive diseases (e.g., HIV) by self-report.
