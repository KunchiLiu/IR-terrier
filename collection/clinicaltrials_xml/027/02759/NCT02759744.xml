      Background:

      Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in U.S. men. Treatments for early or less
      aggressive disease are limited. Researchers want to test a device that destroys cancerous
      tissue with laser energy. They want to see if using it with ultrasound is more comfortable
      than using it with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      Objectives:

      To test a cooled laser applicator system to treat prostate cancer lesions. To see if
      ultrasound imaging is a practical and feasible treatment with laser ablation for focal
      prostate cancer treatment.

      Eligibility:

      Men at least 18 years old with prostate cancer seen on MRI that has not spread in the body.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with standard cancer care tests. These can include physical
      exam, lab tests, and MRI. For the MRI, they lie in a machine that takes pictures.
      Participants will have a prostate biopsy. Needle samples will be taken from 12 places in the
      prostate. This will be guided by MRI and ultrasound, which is obtained through a coil in the
      rectum.

      Participants will stay at the clinic for 1 2 days. A cooling catheter (plastic tube) will be
      put in the bladder. Ultrasound will guide the laser applicator directly to the tumor.

      The cooling catheter will be removed. A different catheter will be put in the urethra to
      keep the bladder emptied.

      The next day, participants will have a physical exam and a PSA blood test.

      Participants will have 6 follow-up visits over 3 years. At each visit, they will have a
      physical exam and lab tests. At some visits, they will also have an MRI or other scans and a
      prostate biopsy.

      Background:

      Pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of real time ultrasound imaging to guide thermal
      laser ablation of low risk focal prostate tumors.

      Prostate cancer is relatively slow growing, with doubling times for local tumors estimated
      at 2 to 4 years.

      Some prostate cancers prove to be small, low grade, and noninvasive and they appear to pose
      little risk to life or health. Recent patient series suggest that 20% to 30% of men
      undergoing radical prostatectomy have pathologic features in the radical prostatectomy
      specimen consistent with an insignificant or &quot;indolent&quot; cancer that poses little threat to
      life or health.

      An NIH/NCI protocol number 11-C-0158 titled MR Image guided focal laser ablation therapy of
      prostate cancer has treated 15 patients without major complication over the past 5 years.
      Out of 15 patients, 3 have had evidence of disease reoccurrence. This data is being prepared
      for publication (verbal communication with Peter Pinto, MD, principal investigator), however
      it requires a very long and resource-intensive MRI imaging, which may be a barrier to broad
      translation to the community setting. Specialized custom and expensive MRI-compatible
      equipment is also required. Focal laser ablation for prostate cancer using the
      Medtronic-Visualase laser is FDA cleared.

      NIH / NCI clinical trials have performed MRI + ultrasound (US) fusion biopsy in nearly 1500
      patients, &gt; 30,000 biopsies over past 12 years.

      We propose to perform ultrasound (US) guided focal laser ablation with fusion visualization
      and co-display of pre-acquired MRI during the treatment of patients with low volume and
      low-grade disease.

      Objectives:

      To determine the feasibility of treating biopsy-confirmed and MR-visible, low-grade prostate
      tumor(s) using ultrasound (US) image-guided focal laser interstitial thermal ablation).

      Eligibility:

      Patients must have localized, low-volume, non-aggressive, low risk prostate cancer that is
      MR visible and confirmed by needle biopsy.

      Tumor must be confined within the prostate and involves one-half of one lobe or less.

      PSA &lt; 15 ng/ml, or PSA density (PSA/prostate volume) &lt; 0.15 ng/mL2 in patients with a PSA &gt;
      15 ng/mL

      Men more than or equal to than 18 years of age.

      Preoperative clearance by NIH Department of Anesthesia and Surgical Services.

      No evidence of metastatic disease per NCCN guidelines

      Design:

      Pilot study, testing feasibility of ultrasound-guided thermal ablation of focal prostate
      cancer.

      A total of 30 patients will be enrolled to yield 20 evaluable patients
