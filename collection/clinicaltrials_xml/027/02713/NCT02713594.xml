      The study is designed to test the hypotheses that financial incentives can increase both
      participation in smoking cessation treatment and resulting cessation rates, when they are
      offered to BadgerCare Plus (Medicaid) smokers as part of their health care.

    <textblock>
      Previous research on providing incentives for healthy behaviors has shown that financial
      incentives can increase treatment participation and boost outcomes when they are tied to
      participation in evidence based treatments. However, most of this research has been done in
      laboratory settings and in relatively small clinical trials. This study is designed to test
      the hypotheses that incentives can increase both participation in smoking cessation
      treatment and resulting cessation rates, when they are offered to Wisconsin BadgerCare Plus
      (Medicaid) smokers as part of their health care. If successful, this treatment approach
      could be used more broadly to reduce the considerable financial and personal costs
      associated with smoking-related disease. Participants in the study are randomized to receive
      no incentive for participation in treatment and successful quitting or incentives.

    <description>The description of the service components that all participants will receive are:
WTQL (Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line) coaching consisting of 5 proactive calls to the participant to help them successfully quit tobacco use, plus ad hoc calls at the participant's initiation.
(If medically cleared) an 8-week supply of nicotine patches using standard dosing protocols (prescribed by patient's primary care provider)
A follow up urine cotinine test at their clinic (at 6 months from enrollment) Participants randomized to this condition will receive financial incentives for them to participate in the biochemical verification visits at baseline and 6 months. They receive no other incentives.</description>
