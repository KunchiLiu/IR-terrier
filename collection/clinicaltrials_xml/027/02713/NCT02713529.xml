      A multi-center Phase 1b/2 study testing the combination of AMG 820 and pembrolizumab in
      subjects with select advanced solid tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1b is AMG 820 dose determining and aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of
      the selected starting dose of AMG 820 in combination with pembrolizumab. Phase 2 of the
      study will further evaluate safety and tolerability and additionally test whether AMG 820
      can enhance the anti-tumor activity observed historically with pembrolizumab alone and/or
      overcome lack of response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in subjects with select solid tumors.
