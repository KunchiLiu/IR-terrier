        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients 18 to 65 years of age included. Women of child-bearing
             potential must be willing to use highly effective methods of contraception during the
             study treatment epoch and for 12 weeks after the last study treatment.

          2. Grave's hyperthyroidism diagnosed prior to screening.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of treatment of Graves' disease with radio-iodine ablation or thyroidectomy
             and/or current treatment with anti-thyroid drugs (methimazole or propylthiouracil)
             within one week of starting the study treatment.

          2. History of hyperthyroidism not caused by Graves' disease (e.g. toxic multinodular
             goiter, autonomous thyroid nodule, or acute inflammatory thyroiditis) and/or history
             or presence of thyroid storm (fever, profuse sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, delirium,
             severe weakness, seizures, markedly irregular heartbeat, yellow skin and eyes
             (jaundice), severe low blood pressure, and coma).

          3. Previous treatment with a B cell-depleting biologic agent or any other
             immune-modulatory biologic agent within 5 half-lives (experimental or approved).

          4. History of recurrent clinically significant infection or of recurrent bacterial
             infections with encapsulated organisms.

          5. History of primary or secondary immunodeficiency, including a positive HIV (ELISA and
             Western blot) test result.

          6. History or evidence of tuberculosis by either of the following tests:

               -  Positive PPD skin test (size of induration measured after 48-72 hours, and a
                  positive result is defined as an induration of â‰¥ 5mm or according to local
                  practice/guidelines) OR

               -  Positive QuantiFERON TB-Gold test

          7. Plans for immunization with a live vaccine within a 2-month period before enrollment
             or during the study period.

          8. Treatment with immunomodulatory drugs, such as cyclosporine A, methotrexate, and/or
             cyclophosphamide within 3 months from baseline. Glucocorticosteroid therapy with
             prednisolone up to 10 mg daily is permitted if patients are on stable dose for more
             than 3 months before enrollment in the study.

          9. Pregnant, breastfeeding females, and women of child bearing potential unless they are
