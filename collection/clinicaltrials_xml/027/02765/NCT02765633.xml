    <description>Cangrelor in four (4) dose cohorts consisting of five subjects in each cohort. One cohort of five subjects will be enrolled at a time, beginning with the lowest cangrelor dose and escalating sequentially to the highest planned dose based on a review of the PK, PD, and safety parameters.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Males and females with congenital heart disease, and ranging in age from birth
             through 28 days of life

          2. Postoperative neonatal cardiac subjects with placement of systemic-to-pulmonary
             artery palliative shunts, right ventricle to pulmonary artery palliative shunts, or
             ductus arteriosus stents who are at risk of thrombotic events after repair for
             structural congenital heart disease.

          3. Written informed consent from a parent/legal guardian

          4. Life expectancy of at least 15 days at study entry

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if any of the following exclusion criteria apply:

          1. History of intracerebral bleed (confirmed by a US of the head prior to surgery), or
             cerebral arteriovenous malformation, or any prior bleed with neurological deficit

          2. Gastrointestinal or urinary bleeding

          3. Cerebrovascular accident or any cerebrovascular accident with a residual neurological
             deficit

          4. Known congenital or acquired bleeding or clotting disorder

          5. Weight less than 2.5 kg

          6. Adjusted gestational age less than 37 weeks

          7. Platelet count less than 100,000 cells/µL

          8. Chest and/or mediastinal tube blood output of greater than 3 mL/kg/hr at the time of
             cangrelor administration

          9. Subjects with evidence of severe hepatic or renal failure [aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than three times normal for age or
             total bilirubin greater than 20 mg/dL; creatinine greater than 2 times the normal
             upper limit]

         10. Known allergy to cangrelor or known sensitivity to any component of cangrelor

         11. Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would constitute a contraindication
             to participation in the study or cause inability to comply with the study
             requirements

         12. Participation in another investigational therapeutic drug or investigational
             therapeutic device trial within 30 days of starting study
