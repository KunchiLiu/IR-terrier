  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating the ability of UroGen's MitoGel™ procedure to treat urothelial
      carcinoma tumors from the upper urinary tract. If this treatment will prove to be effective
      this will lead to the development of a new treatment approach for patients suffering from
      Low Grade Upper Urinary Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC).

      Trial TC-UT-03 is a prospective, single-arm trial, designed to assess the efficacy, safety,
      and tolerability of treatment with MitoGel™ instilled in the upper urinary system of
      patients with non-invasive low-grade (LG), UTUC.

      Upon signing of informed consent, the patients will undergo a screening visit for
      eligibility evaluation. Eligible patients will be treated with MitoGel™ once weekly for a
      total of 6 times; in a retrograde fashion. Patients who will demonstrate CR will be treated
      with MitoGel™ once monthly as a maintenance therapy for a total of 11 instillations or up to
      the first recurrence whichever comes first.

      Five (5) weeks (± 1 w) following the last instillation, the PDE Visit, during which safety
      and efficacy will be assessed, will take place. During this visit, the ablative effect of
      the MitoGel™ will be assessed visually, by upper tract washed urine cytology, and if there
      are remaining tumors, by biopsy or brush biopsy if technically feasible.

      Patient demonstrating CR at PDE will undergo monthly maintenance instillations of MitoGel™
      up to 11 months post PDE. Safety follow-up for these patients will be done until one month
      post last instillation or at the end of the follow-up period in FU visit 12, which is the
      earlier.

      For patients who did not demonstrate Complete Response, to the extent that it is possible,
      all remaining tumors lesions will be biopsied. The patients shall undergo any additional
      surgical or other treatment the PI decides deem necessary to remove remaining tumor.

      An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) was assigned to this trial. Accumulating
      safety, tolerability and efficacy data will be monitored periodically by the DMC according
      to a pre-specified process and frequency detailed in the DMC charter.
