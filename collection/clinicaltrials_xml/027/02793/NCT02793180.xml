  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Middle East and the Gulf, the general population have high cardiovascular risks like
      diabetes, hypertension, smoking and obesity. The average age of a patient with an acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS) event is relatively young compared to Western populations. Women are
      multiparous and the rates of consanguinity marriages are high in this region of the world.
      These risk factors and conditions result in heart failure. Great deal of knowledge is
      missing regarding the influence of these risk factors on heart failure presentation, the
      causes and management of heart failure in ambulatory patients in this region of the world.
