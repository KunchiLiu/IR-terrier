  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of albiglutide and exenatide on
      gastric myoelectrical activity (GMA), gastric emptying (GE) and nausea (as measured by
      visual analogue scale [VAS]) in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study is
      divided in two parts. Part A will characterize the GMA, GE and nausea response to exenatide
      and confirm exenatide as a positive control for Part B. Part B will compare the effects of
      albiglutide and exenatide on GMA, GE and nausea.

      Part A is a single arm, open-label design and all subjects will receive 10 microgram (mcg)
      subcutaneous exenatide twice daily for 5 days. This part will comprise 3 study periods: a
      3-week screening/wash-out, 5-day treatment, and follow-up (within 7 days after the last dose
      of exenatide). The total duration of a subject's participation in Part A will be
      approximately 5 weeks. Once Part A is complete, data will be reviewed and a decision to
      progress to Part B will be made.

      In Part B, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either albiglutide (starting dose of
      30 milligrams [mg] once weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 50 mg once weekly for 4 weeks) or
      exenatide (starting dose of 5 mcg twice daily for 4 weeks, followed by 10 mcg twice daily
      for 4 weeks). The total duration of a subject's participation in the study will be
      approximately 15 weeks.
