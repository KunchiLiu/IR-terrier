  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will set out to confirm the reliability of epidural waveform analysis
      (EWA) as an adjunct to loss of resistance for obstetrical epidural blocks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After loss of resistance, 5 mL of normal saline will be injected through the epidural
      needle; the latter will then be connected to a pressure transducer (leveled with the heart)
      using a rigid tubing. A pressure recording of the epidural waveform will be saved for future
      assessment by a blinded observer.

      After the recording of the waveform, the rigid tubing will be disconnected from the epidural
      needle. A 4 mL bolus of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 5 µg/mL will be injected through the
      latter. An epidural catheter will be advanced 3-4 cm past the tip of the needle inside the
      epidural space. The needle will then be removed and the catheter secured to the skin in the
      usual fashion.

      Fifteen minutes after the injection of the local anesthetic bolus, a blinded observer will
      apply ice to the T1-L5 dermatomes and assess the epidural block.
