    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to collect information about a new treatment for
      severe aortic regurgitation, which affects the aortic valve in the heart. Aortic
      regurgitation is a condition where the heart's aortic valve does not close tightly and
      allows some blood to leak back into the heart chamber. Symptoms of aortic regurgitation may
      include fatigue and shortness of breath. The preferred treatment for severe aortic
      regurgitation is aortic valve replacement surgery. A less invasive surgical approach called
      TAVR is offered to those patients who are high risk for undergoing open heart surgery to
      replace the aortic valve. In this study, TAVR will be performed using the JenaValve
      Pericardial TAVR System, which is intended to help treat severe aortic regurgitation. The
      JenaValve replacement valve is placed inside the aortic valve by using the JenaValve
      delivery system. The JenaValve replacement valve may be implanted in one of two ways: (1)
      transapical - where the valve is implanted through the chest wall, and (2) transfemoral -
      where the valve is implanted through an artery in the groin. The choice of which implant
      method will be used is decided by the doctor.
