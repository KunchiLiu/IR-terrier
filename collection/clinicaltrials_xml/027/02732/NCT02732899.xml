    <textblock>
      To determine safety and efficacy of intravitreal injections of Sirolimus with adjunct EYLEA
      in subjects with exudative age related macular degeneration (AMD) with persistent
      intraretinal or subretinal edema due to neovascular AMD despite previous intravitreal
      antiVEGF treatment.

      This study is a single-center, masked, randomized, 36 week study, designed to evaluate the
      safety and treatment efficacy of intravitreal Sirolimus with adjunct EYLEA® (aflibercept) in
      patients with persistent edema due to neovascular AMD versus EYLEA® (aflibercept) alone.
      Twenty (20) patients will be randomized to receive study medication in a 1:1 ratio. Study
      treatment will be administered by intravitreal injections. The sham injections given in the
      EYLEA® alone group are needleless and they are given in order to help preserve the masking
      of those subjects in that treatment group.

    <description>Sirolimus 440ug for intravitreal injection will be provided in sterile single-use glass vials. One single-dose vial will be packaged in a box for each patient injection. Sirolimus injections will be given at baseline, week 4, 12, 20 and 28. EYLEA® (aflibercept) intravitreal injections will be given at week 1, 8, 16, 24 and 32.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients, 50 years of age or older at baseline

          2. Patient has completed/signed an informed consent prior to any study-related
             procedures and is able to follow study instructions and likely to complete all
             required visits.

             • Ocular Inclusion Criteria (Study eye only):

          3. BCVA 5 - 75 (20/800-20/30), inclusive, in study eye; if both eyes are eligible, the
             eye with the best potential visual improvement as determined by the investigator will
             be selected for treatment.

          4. Presence of choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD

          5. At least 3 previous intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in the past 6 months

          6. Injection of Anti-VEGF may be deferred for at least 4 weeks from randomization based
             on clinical assessment of AMD by the investigator.

          7. Clear ocular media and adequate pupil dilation to permit good quality photographic
             imaging -

        Exclusion Criteria:

             results of the study.

             • Ocular Exclusion Criteria (Study eye only):

          5. Decrease of greater than 150 microns in central subfield thickness as measured by OCT

          6. Aphakia

          7. History of pars plana vitrectomy in the study eye

             ophthalmic surgery in the study eye within the past 30 days

          9. History of significant ocular disease or condition other than exudative AMD that may
             confound results

         10. Uncontrolled glaucoma (defined as intraocular pressure &gt;21mm Hg despite treatment
             with two or more ocular hypotensive medications at baseline)

         11. No active ocular or periocular infections, or ocular malignancy including lymphoma
