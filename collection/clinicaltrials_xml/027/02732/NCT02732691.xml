  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to collect information about a new treatment for
      severe aortic stenosis, which affects the aortic valve in the heart. Aortic stenosis is a
      narrowing of the aortic valve opening, which decreases blood flow from the heart and causes
      symptoms such as chest pain, fainting and shortness of breath. The preferred treatment for
      severe aortic stenosis is aortic valve replacement surgery. A less invasive surgical
      approach called TAVR is offered to those patients who are high risk for undergoing open
      heart surgery to replace the aortic valve. In this study, TAVR will be performed using the
      JenaValve Pericardial TAVR System, which is intended to help treat severe aortic stenosis.
      The JenaValve replacement valve is placed inside the aortic valve by using the JenaValve
      delivery system. The JenaValve replacement valve may be implanted in one of two ways: (1)
      transapical - where the valve is implanted through the chest wall, and (2) transfemoral -
      where the valve is implanted through an artery in the groin. The choice of which implant
      method will be used is decided by the doctor.
