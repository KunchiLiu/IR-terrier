  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a bladder preserving approach for patients with
      muscle invasive bladder cancer using neoadjuvant accelerated Methotrexate, Vinblastine,
      Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin (AMVAC) followed by chemoradiation with intensity modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and Mitomycin C. Patients will have
      maximal transurethral resection, followed by three cycles of AMVAC. Once AMVAC is complete,
      patients will have a second maximal transurethral resection, then chemoradiation with IMRT
      and 5-FU and Mitomycin C, followed by a third maximal transurethral resection. Tolerability
      and efficacy will be evaluated with physical exams, adverse event assessments, quality of
      life questionnaires, labs, and CT/bone scans. Patients will be followed until 5 years status
      post completion of therapy.

          -  AJCC27 clinical stage T2-T4a .

          -  No radiographic evidence of lymph node positivity (N0) or metastatic disease (M0).
             Clinical lymphadenopathy on staging CT greater than 1.5 cm in short axis must be
             biopsy proven negative.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50% by MUGA or ECHO within 6 months of study
             entry.

          -  Normal organ and bone marrow function as defined:

        Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Total
        bilirubin ≤ institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X
        institutional ULN Creatinine Creatinine Clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (calculated using the
        Cockroft-Gault formula or measured with 24 hour urine collection)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any component of small cell histology.

          -  Prior pelvic radiation therapy or patients who have undergone prior radiation to
             greater than or equal to 25% of the bone marrow within the past year are excluded due
             to risk of life threatening myelosuppression

          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy; patients who have received any previous systemic
             chemotherapy or radiation therapy for urothelial carcinoma or cytotoxic chemotherapy
             for another malignancy within 1 year of study entry are ineligible.

          -  Prior or concurrent malignancy of any other site except for non-melanoma skin cancer,
             unless disease free interval ≥ 5 years.

          -  Patients who have received experimental agents within 4 weeks of study entry.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Adriamycin or Cisplatin or other agents
             used in the study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection (defined by current oral or intravenous antibiotic therapy), symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy.

          -  Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cytotoxic
             chemotherapy. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Patients with hydronephrosis that has not been addressed with an intervention such as
             placement of a stent.

          -  Pregnancy &amp; Women of Childbearing Potential
