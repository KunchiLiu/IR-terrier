  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of five
      different tablet formulations of Dabigatran Etexilate, Formulation A1, Formulation B1,
      Formulation C1, Formulation D1, and Formulation E1, compared to commercial capsule
      formulation of Dabigatran Etexilate.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate and compare several pharmacokinetic parameters
      between the treatments.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure [BP],
             pulse rate [PR]), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age &gt;=20 and &lt;=35 years old

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt;=18.0 and &lt;=25.0 kg/m2

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, Pulse Rate, or ECG) deviating
             from normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator at screening

          -  Measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg, diastolic
             blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the range of
             45 to 90 bpm at screening

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to
             be of clinical relevance

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

             thrombocytopenia, cerebrovascular haemorrhage, bleeding tendencies associated with
             active ulceration or overt bleeding of gastrointestinal, respiratory or genitourinary
             tract or any disease or condition with haemorrhagic tendencies

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease considered as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (more than 24 hours) within 30 days or less
             than 10 half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication

             [equivalent to 270 mL] of Sake)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  Subject assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator because of, for
