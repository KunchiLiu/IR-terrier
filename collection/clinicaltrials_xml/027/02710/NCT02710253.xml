      Study Groups and Radiation Therapy:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive radiation
      therapy. The radiation oncologist will decide what type of radiation you receive. Depending
      on the type of radiation that is chosen for you, you may receive radiation anywhere between
      4 days to 3 weeks. The study doctor will discuss what type of radiation you will have and
      how often you will receive it.

      Within 7 days before you begin radiation therapy, you will have radiation simulation to plan
      radiation treatment. During radiation simulation, you will go through the motions of
      receiving radiation (though you will not receive radiation) to help you understand the
      radiation process. This will also help the doctor know where to &quot;aim&quot; the radiation when you
      receive radiation. This may take up to 1 hour.

      Study Visits:

      At start of your radiation therapy and then every 4-12 weeks while you are on study:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (up to 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan. You will not have these scans the day after
           you receive radiation therapy.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive radiation for up to 3 weeks. However, you will continue to have study visits
      every 4-12 weeks. You will continue having study visits unless the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the follow-up visits
      for 1 year.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 30 days after the study stops or you decide to withdraw from the study, you will have
      a physical exam and you will be asked about any side effects you may have and if you have
      had a change in medication. If you cannot come to MD Anderson for this visit, a member of
      the study staff will call you. This call should last about 10 minutes.

      Follow-Up:

      About every 12 weeks for up to 1 year, you will be asked about any side effects you may have
      had and your medical history will be recorded. If you cannot come to MD Anderson for this
      visit, a member of the study staff will call you. This call should last about 10 minutes.

      After 1 year of follow up, you will continue to have follow-up as part of your standard of
      care (collecting information about any side effects you may have and your medical history).
      If the follow-up is at another hospital, the information about your medical history,
      physical exam, lab tests, PET, MRI, or CT scans will be sent to MD Anderson for review.

      This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy is delivered using FDA approved and
      commercially available methods. It is considered investigational to use radiation therapy in
      patients whose disease has gotten worse after receiving immunotherapy.

      The study doctor can explain how radiation therapy is designed to work.

      Up to 150 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             serum pregnancy test will be required.

         11. We will allow prior radiation to other sites, with no washout period, prior to study
             entry as long as the high dose regions of the prior and proposed radiation fields do
             not overlap.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a diagnosis of active scleroderma, lupus, or other rheumatologic disease which in
             the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist precludes safe radiation therapy.

          2. Has had prior radiation therapy within the past 3 months where the high dose area of
             the prior radiation would overlap with the high dose area of the intended radiation
             based on the judgment of the treating radiation oncologist.

          3. Has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a
             previous treatment. *Note: Subjects with permanent &lt;/= Grade 2 toxicities (e.g.
             neuropathy) or toxicities corrected through routine medical management (e.g. thyroid
             replacement for hypothyroidism) are an exception to this criterion and may qualify
             for the study. **Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered
             adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to
             starting therapy. ***Note: Subjects with asymptomatic &lt;/= Grade 2 laboratory or
             dermatologic abnormalities are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the
             study pending the judgment of the treating radiation oncologist.

          4. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
