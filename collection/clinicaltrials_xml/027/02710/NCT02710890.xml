    <description>Up to 2 age-based Cohorts with Cohort 1 including at least 40 subjects who are &gt;=8 to &lt;17 years and Cohort 2 including at least 20 subjects who are &gt;=4 to &lt;8 years.

A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the safety and tolerability data for each Cohort to make the following recommendations: the progression of the current Cohort, including iv infusion durations to be evaluated, and progression to initiate enrollment in the next Cohort (Cohort 2) and whether to initiate the assessment of safety in younger pediatric subjects (&gt;=1 month to &lt;4 years of age)</description>

               1. Open-label lacosmide (OLL) subject: Subject is currently receiving oral
                  lacosmide (LCM) as adjunctive or monotherapy as participants in an open label
                  long-term study (SP848, EP0034, or other pediatric study); OR,

               2. Prescription lacosamide (RxL) subject: Subject is currently receiving prescribed
                  oral LCM from commercial supply (eg, VIMPAT) as adjunctive or monotherapy; OR,

               3. Initiating intravenous lacosamide (IIL) subject: Subject is not currently
                  receiving LCM and will receive intravenous (iv) LCM as adjunctive treatment in
                  EP0060. Initiation of LCM monotherapy is not permitted in IIL subjects.

          -  Subject is an OLL or RxL subject and meets both of the following criteria:

               1. Subject has been administered LCM for the treatment of epilepsy for at least 2
                  weeks prior to Screening; AND,

               2. Subject has been administered (OLL) or prescribed (RxL) oral LCM at a dose of
                  2mg/kg/day to 12mg/kg/day (for subjects &lt;50kg) or 100mg/day to 600mg/day (for
                  subjects &gt;=50kg). Open-label study drug LCM (OLL) or prescribed oral LCM dose
                  (RxL) must be stable for at least 3 days prior to first LCM infusion; OR,

          -  Subject is an ILL subject and is on a stable dosage regimen of at least 1
             antiepileptic drug (AED). The daily dosage regimen of concomitant AED therapy must be
             kept constant for a period of at least 2 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Subject is an acceptable candidate for venipuncture and iv infusion

          -  Subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with all study
             requirements. Subject (or parent[s] or legal representative) is willing to comply
             with all study requirements

          -  Subject has hemodynamically significant heart disease (eg, heart failure)

          -  Subject has an arrhythmic heart condition requiring medical therapy, known cardiac
             sodium channelopathy, such as Brugada syndrome
