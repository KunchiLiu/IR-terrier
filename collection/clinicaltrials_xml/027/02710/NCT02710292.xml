          -  Lenses within the power range specified in the protocol;

          -  Vision correctable to 20/25 or 0.1 logMAR (logarithmic minimum angle of resolution)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently wearing DT1 or TE sphere lenses;

          -  Ocular anterior segment infection, inflammation, abnormality, or active disease that
             would contraindicate contact lens wear;

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications in which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated as determined by the investigator;

          -  Eye injury or surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrollment;

          -  History of herpetic keratitis, ocular surgery or irregular cornea;
