  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of the mandibular overdenture
      retained by a single implant. The study hypothesis is that SIMO is more effective but more
      costly than the conventional denture, though this incremental cost is relatively low for the
      offered effectiveness in terms of clinical and patient-reported outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial alongside a cost-effectiveness analysis will include
      twenty-eight edentulous individuals who meet eligibility criteria. New maxillary and
      mandibular dentures will be fabricated for all participants following a standardized
      protocol. Then, participants will be randomized into one of the treatment groups:
      conventional complete denture group or single-implant mandibular overdenture group. Each
      participant allocated to the overdenture group will then receive a Straumann® Standard Plus
      SLActive® regular neck implant (Straumann 0.33.051S/052S/053S Institute Straumann AG, Basel,
      Switzerland) in the mandibular midline. A healing abutment will be connected and the implant
      will be allowed to heal for approximately 3 weeks. Then, a 3.4mm retentive titanium anchor
      abutment (Straumann 048.439, Institute Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) will be connected
      and tightened to 35 N.cm with a torque wrench. The matrix will be incorporated to the
      denture using self-curing acrylic resin and the patient will be instructed to keep the upper
      and lower dentures firmly occluded in the habitual position until the final polymerization
      of the resin. Direct costs related to therapies in both groups will be identified, measured
      and valuated for one year after treatment and patient-reported outcomes will be assessed.
      Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be estimated and graphically presented on
      cost-effectiveness planes. A Markov decision tree will be constructed to set out the
      consequences of the competing alternatives. Sensitivity analysis on the most important
      assumptions will be performed in order to assess the robustness of the model.

    <description>The cross-culturally adapted Brazilian version of the Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous subjects (OHIP-EDENT) will be used. It contains 19 items divided in four different subscale domains: (I) masticatory discomfort and disability (four items), (II) psychological discomfort and disability (five items), (III) social disability (five items), and (IV) oral pain and discomfort (five items). The items are answerable by a 3-point Likert scale and responses will be summed to result an overall score. Higher scores represent worse OHRQoL.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the dentures</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A 10 cm uninterrupted visual analogue scale will be used in order to assess the participants' ratings of their satisfaction with the upper and lower dentures in relation to the parameters &quot;general satisfaction&quot;, &quot;comfort&quot;, &quot;stability&quot;, &quot;aesthetics&quot;, &quot;ability to speak&quot; and &quot;ability to chew&quot;. Each participant will indicate their level of satisfaction with each parameter by marking a point along the scale, in which ends mean &quot;unsatisfied&quot; and &quot;satisfied&quot;, as it is closer to the beginning or the end of the scale, respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Masticatory efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 12 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Masticatory efficiency will be assessed as a secondary outcome using a two-colored chewing gum test and a qualitative and quantitative colourimetric method to measure the color-mixing ability. Participants will be asked to sit upright in a dental chair and to chew the gum on their preferred chewing side for 20 cycles. Visual and electronic analysis of the chewed gums samples will be done according to the classification proposed by Schimmel et al. Analysis will be made by two investigators blinded to the study groups and treatment stage. The software ViewGum (dHAL Software, Kifissia, Greece, www.dhal.com) will be used for electronic colourimetric analysis.</description>
