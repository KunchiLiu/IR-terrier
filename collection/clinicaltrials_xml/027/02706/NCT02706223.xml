  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C Virus, (HCV), infection is a major health concern in the UK with up to 0.7% of
      the population infected. At best, 25% of those infected will clear the infection
      spontaneously, though for those who develop a chronic infection, they may go onto to develop
      liver cirrhosis or liver cancers.

      The standard of care within the NHS is that patients with a history of intravenous drug use
      or those currently on methadone are at high risk of having HCV infection and should be
      offered HCV testing. Once diagnosed they can be referred to nurse led treatment pathways.
      Less than 10% of the methadone users are even tested for HCV and of them fewer than 20% go
      onto treatment regimens that successfully clear the infection despite regular interactions
      with heath care staff.

      Pharmacists who have daily interactions with patients receiving methadone are ideally placed
      to deliver anti HCV therapy as they have daily contact with this client group and are well
      placed to advise on the drug therapy.

      The SuperDOT C study will examine the impact of pharmacy led Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)
      for HCV treatment in patients attending Community Pharmacies in participating Health Boards
      within NHS Scotland. The impact of this approach will be compared with those referred to
      standard care pathways on how well participants clear their HCV infection.

      The SuperDOT-C study will evaluate a new pathway of care for patients on OST who are already
      receiving OST therapy on a daily basis from a pharmacist. Newer therapies for HCV have
      recently become much simpler to initiate and supervise with much improved effectiveness and
      as described below it is now proposed to extend the role of community pharmacists into
      initiating HCV therapy alongside the existing OST The SuperDOT-C study will utilise this
      existing environment and relationship to smooth the pathway into HCV therapy with
      co-administration of OST alongside the anti-HCV therapy under the supervision of the
      pharmacist compared with the established pathway of referral to another site and treatment
      with a nurse led ant-HCV treatment program. This new pathway may have positive effects on
      the movement towards HCV cure at multiple levels. The planned pathway is different to
      current care at each point, from testing and diagnosis through adherence to cure. In the
      planned pathway, the patient interacts with the pharmacist on a daily basis, as compared to
      intermittent interaction with a secondary care team member. The result being that the
      patient has a shorter care pathway, with less travelling and better access to anti-HCV
      treatment. The daily interaction with the pharmacy provides opportunities to assess and
      support the patient, provide sound advice and care, with the added benefit of being able to
      directly observe treatment, (DOT), thus potentially improving adherence.
