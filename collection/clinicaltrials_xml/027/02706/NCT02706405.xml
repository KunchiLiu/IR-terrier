    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies whether anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)19-chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cells (JCAR014) and durvalumab are
      safe in combination and can work together in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      that has returned after a period of improvement or has not responded to previous treatment.
      JCAR014 is made of patients' immune cells (T cells) that have a new gene added to them in a
      laboratory, which programs them to kill lymphoma cells. Durvalumab is a type of drug called
      a monoclonal antibody, targeted to PD-L1 that may help immune cells attack cancer cells more
      effectively and thus help JCAR014 work better.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of JCAR014 in combination with durvalumab in adult patients with
      relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of durvalumab in combination with JCAR014.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of JCAR014.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumor activity of JCAR014 in combination with durvalumab in R/R B-cell
      NHL.

      II. To estimate the duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall
      survival (OS) in patients treated with JCAR014 in combination with durvalumab.

      III. To characterize the PK profile of durvalumab.

      IV. To assess the immunogenicity of JCAR014 and durvalumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of JCAR014 and durvalumab in blood and within the
      tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of durvalumab administered with a single fixed dose
      of JCAR014. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms, listed as Groups 1 and 2 below.

      LYMPHODEPLETING CHEMOTHERAPY: All patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on
      day -5 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -4 to -2.

      GROUP I: Patients receive JCAR014 IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0 and durvalumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 28 (may occur as early as day 21) and then every 4 weeks for up to 10 doses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days -1 and 28, and JCAR014 IV
      over 20-30 minutes on day 0. Patients may receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes every 4
      weeks for up to 11 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, and 3 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, and then periodically for at least 15 years.
