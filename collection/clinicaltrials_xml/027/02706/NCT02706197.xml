  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumors with low oxygen levels are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to standard
      radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The ability to make repeated oxygen measurements in tumors
      could be used to help select the most effective treatment or the best timing to start
      therapies. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the safety and feasibility of using an
      implantable oxygen sensor, known as the OxyChip, to make oxygen measurements in tumors using
      EPR oximetry, a technique related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial. Total enrollment will be 12 patients. The study is split
      in a phase IA (short duration of implantation &lt; 4 weeks with no other cancer therapy planned
      prior to excision) and a phase IB (longer duration of implantation while receiving radiation
      therapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical excision), as described below.

      The initial 6 patients will have the OxyChip placed for a short duration (up to 4 weeks)
      after which the OxyChip will be removed when the tumor mass is resected, prior to delivery
      of any further therapies. After successful implantation and removal of the OxyChip in the
      first 6 protocol patients, enrollment will be opened to an additional 6 patients who will
      either receive radiotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy while the OxyChip is in place. Up to
      five oxygen measurements per week will be made during the course of radiation or
      chemotherapy. The OxyChips will be removed at surgery. Patients receiving radiation or
      chemotherapy will be evaluated at least weekly for assessment with respect to any adverse
      events for the primary objective and oximetry measurements will be taken periodically at
      least one day after implantation and up to its removal at the planned tumor excision to
      assess the secondary objective. Following resection, the tissue surrounding the OxyChip will
      be examined for any adverse events for the primary objective. For the exploratory
      objectives, the tissue will also be examined for biomarkers associated with hypoxia or
      growth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Phase IA: Any tumor identified on imaging or through physical examination and that is
             going to receive surgical resection with intent to remove the entire tumor. The tumor
             must be sufficiently large to accommodate the OxyChip.

          2. Phase IB: Any biopsy-proven malignancy expected to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy
             or radiotherapy prior to resection. The tumor must be sufficiently large to
             accommodate the OxyChip.

          3. Malignancy must be present within 1.5 cm of the surface of the skin

          4. Subject must be capable of giving informed consent or has an acceptable surrogate
             capable of giving consent on behalf of the subject.

          5. Anticipated time between implantation and planned surgical excision of at least three
             days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy.

          2. Receipt of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or planned sequential
             chemotherapy and radiotherapy, prior to resection (Phase 1B).

          3. Receipt of Avastin, or other angiogenesis inhibitors during the study.

          4. Prior radiotherapy to the site of implantation.
