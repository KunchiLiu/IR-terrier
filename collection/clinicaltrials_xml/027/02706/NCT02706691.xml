      This phase IIa proof-of-concept open-label trial will consist of two cohorts namely, HPV(+)
      and HPV(-) and will be run across multiple centers through the University of Chicago PCC
      Consortium. All eligible patients with histologically-confirmed recurrent/metastatic HNSCC
      and FGFR alteration will receive BGJ398 at 125 mg PO daily. Patients with FGFR1-3 high level
      amplification, mutation, or translocation will be included.

      Primary Objectives

      To assess efficacy of BGJ398 in FGFR altered HPV (-) and HPV (+) HNSCC.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To assess efficacy of BGJ398 in relation to specific genetic aberrations in HPV (+) and
           HPV (-) FGFR altered HNSCC (i.e. FGFR3-TACC3 translocation, FGFR1 high copy
           number/amplification, FGFR2 mutation, FGFR3 mutation).

        2. To assess safety and tolerability of BGJ398 in patients with Head and Neck Cancer.

        3. To assess progression free and overall survival.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Must meet all of the following:

          1. Histologically documented diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck
             including nasopharyngeal carcinomas (lymphephithelioma histology is ok if criteria 2
             is met).

             a) Patients must have progressed on prior platinum based therapy (or have become
             intolerant) prior to enrollment on this study.

          2. FGFR genetic alterations (specifically FGFR1-3 mutation, amplification, or
             translocation) via DNA or RNA based assay. Prescreening has to be completed prior to
             enrollment on this study. Commercial or local testing is typically expected, but
             samples can also be sent to the Univ. of Chicago for testing.

             The following genetic aberrations will be screened for:

               -  FGFR1 amplification, FGFR1 somatic mutations, FGFR1 translocations.

               -  FGFR2 somatic mutations, FGFR2 translocations, FGFR2 amplification.

               -  FGFR3 somatic mutations, FGFR3 translocations, FGFR3 amplification.

             Other genetic FGF/FGFR pathway aberrations may be acceptable should such genetic
             changes be observed to emerge and require approval per the Lead Investigator for
             enrollment (e.g. FGF amplification).

          3. Consent to undergo a fresh biopsy in case of benefit from therapy and subsequent
             progression

          4. ECOG performance status ≤1

          5. Patients must provide written informed consent prior to any screening procedures.

          6. Age 18 years or older.

          7. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan and laboratory tests

          8. Patient is able to swallow and retain oral medication, unless approval per the

               2. Stable neuropathy of ≤ grade 2 due to prior cancer therapy

         10. HPV status in Oropharyngeal Carcinomas. While HPV status (e.g. via p16) does not have
             to be known prior to consenting, the HPV status (e.g. using p16 IHC) needs to be
             established prior to start of therapy.

         11. Presence of measurable disease by RECIST 1.1

         12. Availability of tumor tissue (e.g. FFPE) for genomic profile (typically 12 unstained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of another primary malignancy except adequately treated in situ carcinoma of
             the cervix or non-melanoma carcinoma of the skin or any other curatively treated
             malignancy that has not been treated in the prior 3 months or expected to require
             treatment for recurrence during the course of the study.

          2. Patients with metastatic CNS tumors are allowed provided that they are clinically
             stable for a period of 30 days prior to study entry and there is not a requirement

         22. Study medication cannot be administered through G-tube, unless additional information
             from the manufacturer becomes available in the future.

         23. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 3 months following the discontinuation of study treatment must
             be used by both sexes (=female patients and their male partners). Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study
                  treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
                  the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects
                  on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  subject.

               -  Combination of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy
                       (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository

             Note: Oral contraceptives (OC), injected or implanted hormonal methods are not
             allowed as the sole method of contraception because BGJ398 has not been characterized
             with respect to the potential to interfere with PK and/or the effectiveness of OCs.

             Post-menopausal women are allowed to participate in this study. Women are considered
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.

         24. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug
             and for 3 months after the last dose of the study drug and should not father a child
             in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to
             prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.
