  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing
      (CAD/CAM) and semi-custom insole types on pain, quality of life and physical performance and
      also to decide whether they are necessary in treatment of painful flexible flatfoot.

    <description>A computer numerical control machine was used to product insoles according to pedobarographic pressure data;35 Shore A hardness ethyl vinyl acetate was used for the main insole, and 3 mm, 15 Shore A hardness ethyl vinyl acetate was used for covering. Orthotic insoles have been implemented in a pair of sports shoes.</description>

    <intervention_name>Semi-custom Insole</intervention_name>
    <description>Plantar surfaces of each patient's metatarsophalangeal joints were marked with a thick broad marker, and the participants were asked to stand on a clean paper. The borders of the foot were then drawn, and the medial longitudinal arch length was marked from the anterior aspect of the heel to the first metatarsophalangeal joint. These marks were used in designing and production. 35 Shore A hardness ethyl vinyl acetate was used for the main insole, and 3 mm, 15 Shore A hardness ethyl vinyl acetate was used for covering. Orthotic insoles have been implemented in a pair of sports shoes.</description>
