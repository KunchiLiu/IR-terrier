  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this
      investigational drug, brigatinib (AP261136) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have had first-line treatment for their cancer
      and it still got worse, even after, or while taking drugs called ALK inhibitors, or
      anti-cancer drugs that act on tumors. Some examples of these anti-cancer drugs are:
      KEYTRUDA® or ALECENSA®).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant population of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) plus Non-small cell lung cancer
      patients exist that have progressed on or who were intolerant of second generation
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor (e.g. ceritinib or alectinib). Brigatinib has
      demonstrated activity in patients who have progressed on crizotinib, but the activity of
      brigatinib in patients who have progressed on ceritinib, alectinib, or other second
      generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors is unknown. Based on the preclinical data.
      3, brigatinib is the only known anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor with potent activity
      against known secondary anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutations suggesting it may retain
      activity as third-line treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease.

      Patients enrolled in ARI-AT-002 must have previously received a second generation Anaplastic
      lymphoma kinase inhibitor other than brigatinib. Given that third-line treatment of
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease is analogous to a phase I population, we have chosen
      20% as a clinically meaningful response rate that would justify further study of brigatinib
      in previously treated anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease.

          -  Previous treatment with one second generation ALK inhibitor (e.g., ceritinib or
             alectinib) other than brigatinib

          -  Brain lesions may be used as target lesions if progressing, are greater than or equal
             to 10mm in longest diameter and if they were not previously treated with any of the
