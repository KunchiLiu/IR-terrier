      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of laboratory-treated (central memory/naive)
      cluster of differentiation 8+ T cells (autologous Wilms tumor [WT]1-T cell receptor [TCRc]4
      gene-transduced CD8-positive central memory T-cells [TCM]/naïve T cells [TN] lymphocytes)
      and how well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that is newly
      diagnosed or has come back. Genetically modified therapies, such as autologous WT1-TCRc4
      gene-transduced CD8-positive TCM/TN lymphocytes, are taken from a patient's blood, modified
      in the laboratory so they specifically may kill cancer cells with a protein called WT1, and
      safely given back to the patient. The &quot;genetically modified&quot; T-cells have genes added in the
      laboratory to allow them to recognize leukemia cells that express WT1 and kill them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety/potential toxicities associated with treating high-risk acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with polyclonal autologous CD8+ Tn and Tcm cells
      genetically-modified to express a high affinity WT1-specific TCR (TCRC4).

      II. Determine the feasibility of treating high-risk AML patients with polyclonal autologous
      CD8+ TN and TCM cells genetically-modified to express a high affinity WT1-specific TCR.

      III. Determine and compare the in vivo persistence in blood and at the primary tumor site
      (e.g. bone marrow, chloroma) of transferred polyclonal autologous CD8+ TN and TCM cells
      transduced to express TCRC4.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether adoptive transferred autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ cells have
      antitumor activity in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      II. In patients with measurable tumor burden prior to infusion of TCRC4-transduced CD8+
      cells: measure the change in tumor burden by assessment of morphology, flow cytometry,
      cytogenetics and/or molecular testing at baseline and after infusion of T cells.

      III. In all patients (those with or without measurable tumor burden prior to T cell
      transfer): compare the probability of relapse, disease-free survival and overall survival of
      patients receiving TCRC4-transduced CD8+ cells with patients in the observation arm.

      IV. Determine and compare the migration to the primary tumor site of adoptively transferred
      polyclonal autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ TCM and TN cells.

      V. Determine and compare the in vivo functional capacity of transferred polyclonal
      autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ TCM to CD8+ TN cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 4 weeks after completion of last course of chemotherapy, patients receive
      autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8+ TCM/TN lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 1-4
      hours on days 0 and 14. Beginning 6 hours after the second infusion of T cells, patients
      also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) for 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have clinically benefitted from T
      cell therapy may receive additional infusions of T cells and aldesleukin at the discretion
      of the principal investigator (PI) and the attending physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 4 weeks, monthly
      for 2 months, at 6 and 12 months for the first year, and then annually for 14 years
      thereafter.
