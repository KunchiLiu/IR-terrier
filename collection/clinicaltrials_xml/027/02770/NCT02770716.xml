  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of intravenous terlipressin versus placebo
      in the treatment of adult subjects with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) Type 1.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter pivotal trial
      of terlipressin in subjects with HRS type 1. HRS is a rare syndrome of marked renal
      dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and portal
      hypertension. HRS type 1 is characterized by a rapid progressive renal impairment and has a
      very poor prognosis with &gt;80% mortality within 3 months. At present, there are no approved
      drug therapies for HRS type 1 in the US or Canada. The only curative treatment for HRS type
      1 and the underlying end-stage cirrhosis is liver transplantation. However, many patients
      will not survive long enough to receive a liver transplant. Increased understanding of the
      pathophysiology of HRS type 1 has demonstrated that vasoconstrictive drug therapy may
      reverse HRS type 1. Substantial data available from many published clinical investigations
      in the literature provide compelling evidence suggesting that administration of terlipressin
      improves renal function in patients with HRS. A total of 300 subjects are planned to be
      enrolled at approximately 70 sites in the US and Canada. An interim analysis is scheduled
      after 150 subjects are enrolled. The study will be stopped if the pre-specified threshold
      for efficacy criteria is met at interim analysis.
