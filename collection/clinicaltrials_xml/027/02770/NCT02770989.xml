  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, single arm, multicenter, CE marking trial for
      patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to undergo an ablation of the cardiac tissue
      near the PV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to confirm the safety and performance of the
      Vimecon® Laser Cardiac Ablation Instrument when creating scar tissue within the cardiac wall
      for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

      Up to 66 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation refractory to at least one
      antiarrhythmic medications (Class I or III) are enrolled. with an expected 10% dropout; 59
      per protocol patients are required.

      The study duration will be 18 month with a 6 month enrollment period and 12 month follow-up.
      Interim follow-up visits are at post procedure, 1 Month, 3 Months, 6 Months and 12 Months.

      The baseline and follow up tests are standard of care. Additional optional tests are an
      esophageal endoscopy for determination of potential fistula formation and a cerebral MRI for
      micro embolism post treatment.

• Evaluating the proportion of subjects free from experiencing Serious Adverse Events related to the catheter ablation procedure (Major Adverse Events's or safety events) within the first three (3) months after the treatment.
Major adverse events (MAE, Safety events) associated with the catheter ablation procedure include:
Cardiac tamponade
Thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism and stroke
Complete heart block
Acute myocardial infarction
Phrenic nerve palsy
Atrio-esophageal fistula
