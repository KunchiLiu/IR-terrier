  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine how effective repeated fasting over 26 weeks (6
      months) is at improving risk parameters that are surrogate endpoints for cardiovascular
      diseases, metabolic dysregulation and cognitive impairments.

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to water-only fasting or to their ad libitum usual diet,
      with randomization performed within strata based on fasting history (≤180 hours or 181-720
      hours of total fasting for &gt;12 consecutive hours per episode in the previous two years).
      Subjects will be assessed at 4, 13 and 26 weeks following randomization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female, 21-60 years of age,

               -  who are not currently taking a statin medication,

               -  who have either pre-diabetes (clinical diagnosis, hemoglobin A1c ≥6.0%, or
                  untreated fasting glucose &gt; 100 mg/dL within 6 months of screening) and are not
                  taking medications to control diabetes OR three or more of the components of the
                  metabolic syndrome (1. fasting glucose level &gt;100 mg/dL, 2. systolic blood
                  pressure ≥130 mmHg, diastolic ≥85 mmHg, or use of an antihypertensive
                  medication, 3. high-density lipoprotein cholesterol &lt;40 mg/dL for males or &lt;50
                  mg/dL for females, 4. triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL or use of a non-statin
                  triglyceride-lowering medication (e.g., fibrate, niacin), 5. waist circumference
                  ≥40 inches (102 cm) for males or ≥35 inches (88 cm) for females, or body mass
                  index &gt;25 kg/m2),

               -  are 21-39 years of age with LDL-C of 100-189 mg/dL OR are 40-60 years of age
                  with either LDL-C of 100-129 mg/dL OR LDL-C of 130-159 mg/dL and &lt;7.5% ten-year
                  risk for heart attack or stroke based on the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations
                  (http://my.americanheart.org/professional/StatementsGuidelines/PreventionGuidelines/Prevention-Guidelines_UCM_457698_SubHomePage.jsp).

          2. Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be
             obtained prior to initiation of any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant and/or lactating women and women of child bearing potential who are not
             using acceptable means of contraception. Women who become pregnant after enrollment
             in the study will be withdrawn for the health of the mother and baby.

          2. Individuals who have purposefully fasted more than 15 hours per day more than one day
             per month during the past two years (i.e., &gt;720 hours over two years), except for
             those who fast during multiple weeks once per year (e.g., Muslim, Baha'i) who will be
             allowed to begin participation starting at two weeks after their preferred annual
             period of fasting ends (e.g., Ramadan or the Baha'i fast) and ending at six months
             prior to the beginning of the next annual observance, as long as they do not fast
             routinely outside of the one annual period of fasting.

          3. Refusal to drink water while fasting.

          4. Prior diagnosis of a chronic disease (i.e., defined as symptomatic coronary artery
             disease, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, peripheral vascular disease, renal
             disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other chronic lung disease,
             immunodeficiency, solid organ transplant, clinical depression, eating disorder, type
             I diabetes, dementia, traumatic brain injury including post-concussive syndrome,
             neurologic disorders, and cancer of any type other than of the skin excluding
             melanoma).

          5. Patients with pre-diabetes who are on a diabetes medication.

          6. Participation in any other clinical trials involving investigational or marketed
             products within 30 days prior to entry in the study.

          7. Other conditions that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator may increase risk
             to the subject and/or compromise the quality of the clinical trial.
