    <textblock>
      This randomized phase IIb trial studies how well curcumin works in preventing gastric cancer
      in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and/or gastric intestinal metaplasia. Curcumin
      is an antioxidant compound found in plants that may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the change in gastric mucosal interleukin (IL)-1beta cytokine level,
      quantified by Luminex assay technology, after a 6 month intervention in participants
      randomly assigned to the curcumin (Meriva) versus placebo arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of Meriva versus placebo. II. To compare changes
      in Histology Gastric Score (HGS) from baseline to 6 months for Meriva versus placebo.

      III. To compare changes in additional gastric mucosal cytokine/chemokine levels (IL-8, tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha [TNFalpha], and inducible protein[IP]-10; quantified by Luminex
      assay).

      IV. To compare changes in gastric mucosal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage (gamma H2A
      histone family, member X [gamma-H2AX] assessed by flow cytometry).

      V. To explore associations between proinflammatory cytokine genotype status (IL-1beta, IL-8,
      and TNFalpha single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]; characterized at baseline) and the
      above outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM 1: Patients receive curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 180 days in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 180 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and 7 months.

    <description>Changes in the concentrations (or categories) will be explored within and between the intervention arms. Fisher's exact tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and two-sample t-tests will be used to assess differences between groups. McNemar's tests, Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and paired sample t-tests will be used to assess differences within each arm. Graphical methods (i.e. boxplots, scatter plots, etc.) will also be used to describe the data.</description>
