        Subjects will be healthy and non-healthy male and female subjects older than 1 month of
        age. Subjects will be recruited in diversified demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, skin
        tone, comorbidities, etc)

        Subjects may be recruited for the study from the physician's clinical practice, or by
        advertisement. Information to be disseminated to subjects and any advertisements will be
        approved by the IRB for the site.

        Subjects in the ICU will be screened prior to scheduled blood draw, by reviewing the
        medical records for the most recent laboratory hemoglobin measurement.
