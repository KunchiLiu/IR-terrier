    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label, multiple dose study of pexidartinib in Asian
      subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in a dose escalation to
      assess the safety and tolerability, PK and PD, and preliminary antitumor activity of
      pexidartinib.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age should be ≥ 20 years.

          -  Subjects must have a pathologically documented solid tumor that has relapsed from, or
             is refractory to standard treatment, or for which no standard treatment is available.

          -  All associated toxicity from previous cancer therapy must have been resolved (to ≤
             Grade 1) prior to administration of pexidartinib.

          -  ECOG PS of 0 or 1.

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function tests.

          -  Adequate treatment washout period before registration defined as:

               -  Major surgery: ≥ 4 weeks (2 weeks for less invasive surgery, such as colostomy)

               -  Radiation therapy (eg, whole brain radiotherapy): ≥ 4 weeks (if palliative
                  stereotactic radiation therapy, ≥ 2 weeks)

               -  Chemotherapy or immunotherapy (including targeted therapy with antibody or small
                  molecule, retinoid therapy, and hormonal therapy): 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of
                  the agent, whichever is shorter (if the regimen has contained nitrosoureas or
                  mitomycin C, ≥ 6 weeks)

               -  Other investigational drug therapy: ≥ 4 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, external biliary shunt, or significant
             small bowel resection that would have precluded adequate absorption.

          -  Previous use of pexidartinib or any biologic treatment targeting colony stimulating
             factor 1 (CSF-1) or the receptor for colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF1R); previous
             use of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors, eg, imatinib or nilotinib, is allowed.

          -  Clinically active primary central nervous system tumors or brain metastasis, defined
             as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with steroids or anticonvulsants
             to control associated symptoms.

          -  Active or chronic infection with hepatitis C or known positive hepatitis B surface.
             antigen, or known active or chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus.

          -  A screening Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) ≥ 450 ms (men) or ≥ 470 ms
             (women).

          -  A medical history or complications of clinically significant lung disease (eg,
             interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and severe radiation
             pneumonitis).

          -  A history of symptomatic congestive heart failure ([CHF]; New York Heart Association
             [NYHA] Classes II to IV) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment.

          -  A history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months before
             enrollment.

          -  An uncontrolled infection requiring intravenous injection of antibiotics, antivirals,
             or antifungals.
