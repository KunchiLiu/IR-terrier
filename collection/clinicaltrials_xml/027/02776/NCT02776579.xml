  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of today's youth do not engage in enough physical activity (PA) to maintain
      good health. Low PA levels are associated with poor health (e.g. diabetes, high blood
      pressure) and early mortality. Girls are less likely than boys to be active, and their rates
      of participation drop off more steeply during adolescence. Girls report many barriers to
      exercise, including transportation issues and feeling self-conscious about their appearance
      and abilities. School-based PA programs that try to improve health, mainly through aerobic
      exercise and education, have had a small effect to date. However, the few programs that
      included resistance training as the focus showed strong improvements in health related
      measures. In this project, we will examine the effect of a female strength and conditioning
      specialist on decreasing barriers and increasing the overall health of high school girls,
      with the delivery of in-school, girls-only resistance training programs. We will see if
      physical and mental health changes with the training, and how the presence of the S &amp; C
      specialist affects the girls' social interactions within the school. The results will help
      individuals in the education sector plan programs and services to improve overall youth and
      school health.
