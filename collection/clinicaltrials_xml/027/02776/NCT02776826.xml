    <textblock>
      The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) is conducting the pilot phase of an international,
      observational, World Bleeding Disorders Registry (WBDR). This pilot phase will assess the
      feasibility of conducting an expanded WBDR to more centres with a more comprehensive case
      report form, around the world.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot phase of the WBDR is an observational disease registry of patients with
      hemophilia. Forty hemophilia treatment centres (HTCs), of varying levels of economic
      development (emerging, mid-level and established), that have data entry capabilities and the
      ability to obtain the required data on patients in English, were invited to participate in
      the pilot phase. Participating HTCs will complete a Minimal Data Set (MDS) of data on
      approximately 10 patients each.

      A series of performance indicators have been identified by the Steering committee and will
      be used to assess the feasibility of expanding the pilot phase to the WBDR. The performance
      indicators include: proportion of HTCs invited that are willing to participate; proportion
      of participating HTCs who successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals; proportion of
      patients approached who consent to participate; proportion of enrolled patients on which
      data collection and database entry is successful.
