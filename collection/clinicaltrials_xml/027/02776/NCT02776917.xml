      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety of the investigational drug called
      cirmtuzumab in combination with the breast cancer drug paclitaxel. Cirmtuzumab is a type of
      drug called a monoclonal antibody. This drug is designed to attach to a protein called ROR1
      that is on the surface of breast cancer cells. This blocks growth and survival of the breast
      cancer cells. ROR1 is rarely expressed on healthy cells so this drug should target the
      cancer cells. Cirmtuzumab is considered experimental because its use is not approved by
      United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      Although there is evidence from tests on laboratory animals that cirmtuzumab can decrease
      the number of breast cancer cells, we do not know if this will work in humans. This drug has
      been tested in humans before, but has never been tested in patients with breast cancer, or
      in combination with paclitaxel in humans. Therefore, the goal of this study is to see if
      cirmtuzumab is safe and tolerable, when in given in combination with paclitaxel in study
      participants. You will be evaluated to find out what effects (good and bad) cirmtuzumab has
      on you and we would like to learn more about how cirmtuzumab might affect the growth of your
      cancer cells. We would also like to see how long the drug stays in your body and what
      affects the drug may have on your body.

      This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study in patients with Her2
      negative metastatic or locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer who have not previously
      received paclitaxel in the metastatic setting.

      All patients providing informed consent will be screened for eligibility. Baseline
      assessments will include vital signs, physical exam, blood hematology and chemistries, ECOG
      Performance Status evaluation, a bone scan and tumor assessment by physical exam and/or CT
      scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis. Patients who are eligible and proceed with study
      participation will be asked to provide an optional tumor sample for correlative studies
      within 30 days prior to study treatment initiation.

      Cirmtuzumab will be administered via intravenous infusion every two weeks (i.e., Day 1 and
      Day 15 of a 28-day cycle). Two dosing cohorts are planned and the starting dose will 8 mg/kg
      and 16 mg/kg. The 8 mg/kg dose has been tested and found to be safe in patients with CLL.
      Patients will receive four doses of cirmtuzumab unless the patient exhibits disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 is administered weekly by
      intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. Patients may discontinue
      study treatment if they have progressive disease, are experiencing unacceptable toxicity,
      withdraw consent, or if the treating physician determines it's in their best interest.
      Patients may also continue to receive paclitaxel after cirmtuzumab has been discontinued.

      Clinical evaluation of history and symptoms, physical exams, and vitals will be performed on
      Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, and blood draws for laboratory work will be performed weekly
      during treatment. Blood draws for pharmacokinetics will occur on Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1.
      Patients will be asked to provide a second optional tumor sample for correlative studies
      15-30 days after Cycle 2 Day 15.

      An end of treatment visit for clinical evaluations and safety assessments will be performed
      approximately 28 days after the last dose of cirmtuzumab. Tumor response will be assessed
      approximately 56 days after the last dose of cirmtuzumab by physical exam and/or CT scan of
      the chest/abdomen/pelvis, and a bone scan if applicable. A follow-up assessment for adverse
      events will occur approximately 84 days after the last dose of cirmtuzumab.
