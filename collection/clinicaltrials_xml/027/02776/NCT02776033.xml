  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study with GSK2982772, a receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1) kinase
      inhibitor, in subjects with active plaque-type psoriasis.

      The primary objective will be to investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat oral
      doses of GSK2982772 (60 mg twice daily for 84 days). In addition a number of experimental
      and clinical endpoints will be employed to obtain information on the pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and efficacy in subjects with active plaque-type psoriasis (PsO).

      After a screening period of up to 30 days, approximately 30 subjects will be randomized to
      receive either GSK2982772 or placebo for 84 days (12 weeks), followed by a follow-up period
      (28 days). The total duration of this study is approximately 20 weeks from screening to the
      last study visit.
