      The proposed study is two-arms, cross-over, randomized and single-center, in clinic
      Investigation in subjects with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy.

      The purpose of the study is to compare two closed-loop strategies in terms of glycemic
      control in Type 1 Diabetes during a camp setting.

      A total of 20 up to 60 subjects will be enrolled . Subjects will be randomized to
      participate in two periods of closed-loop treatment, each period will last 3-5 days in a
      camp setting. In one period glycemic control will be controlled by the Hybrid Closed-Loop
      System (HCL) and another period by Hybrid Logic Closed-Loop System (HLCL). The sequence of
      treatments with first period HCL therapy than HLCL or vice versa will be randomly assigned.
