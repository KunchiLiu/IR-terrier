  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects more than 78 million adults in the United States and it is estimated that
      35% of the US population is obese. Currently, more than 179,000 bariatric procedures are
      performed in the US each year with the majority of these surgeries using laparoscopic
      techniques. Surgeons often request deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) during surgery, but
      there is no evidence that a deep NMB improves surgical conditions and that the surgeons can
      discriminate between a moderate and deep NMB. There is also evidence that maintaining low
      insufflation pressures during laparoscopic surgery may decrease postoperative pain. The goal
      of this prospective, randomized, assessor-blinded controlled trial is to test the hypothesis
      that deep NMB provides optimal surgical conditions during laparoscopic bariatric surgery in
      the morbidly obese patient. It will also determine if deep NMB allows the surgeon to utilize
      lower insufflation pressure and decreases postoperative pain requirements after laparoscopic
      bariatric surgery.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of four groups:

        1. moderate neuromuscular block (NMB) + 10 mm insufflation pressure (IP);

        2. moderate NMB + 15 mm IP;

        3. deep NMB + 10 mm IP; or

        4. deep NMB + 15 mm IP.

      A moderate NMB block will be defined as 2-3 twitches in the train of four (TOF) and a deep
      NMB will be defined as 0-1 posttetanic count. The surgeons will be asked to rate their
      satisfaction with the surgical conditions using a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 1
      (extremely poor) to 5 (optimal conditions). The first rating will occur at the beginning of
      the procedure when the NMB level is stable at either a deep or moderate block and the
      intra-abdominal pressure is either 10 or 15 mm Hg (per randomization). The surgeon will be
      blinded to the insufflation pressure at this point. If the surgical conditions are rated as
      extremely poor or poor, the level of the neuromuscular block can be increased and/or the
      insufflation pressure can be increased to 15 mm Hg.

    <description>The patients will be randomized to an initial insufflation pressure of 10 or 15 mm hg. If the surgeons are not satisfied with the initial operating conditions, the insufflating pressure will be increase to 15 mm Hg (if not already at that level). This will be reported as the percentage of patients who were able to have their entire surgery performed at an insufflation pressure of 10 mm Hg.</description>
