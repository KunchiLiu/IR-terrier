    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase II trial to examine efficacy and safety of a novel combination
      of pembrolizumab plus induction GM-CSF in patients with advanced biliary cancers treated at
      UCSF.

      This phase II study will examine the efficacy and safety of the novel combination of
      pembrolizumab plus induction GM-CSF in advanced biliary cancer patients with the hypotheses
      that the combination may increase proportion of patients with PFS6 compared to contemporary
      historical controls, with acceptable safety.

    <description>Nine study participants will be enrolled in a safety group, and will begin treatment with pembrolizumab alone for the first 3 weeks, then receive treatment with GM-CSF in addition to pembrolizumab for weeks 4-9. After week 9, all patients in the first phase will continue to receive pembrolizumab alone. The safety of the combination of pembrolizumab and GM-CSF will be assessed before enrolling people into the 2nd phase of the study.</description>
