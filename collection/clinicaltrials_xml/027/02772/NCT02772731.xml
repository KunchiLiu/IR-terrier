  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women in the US. Surgical management
      is the mainstay of therapy, and in general consists of resection of the primary tumor with
      either a partial mastectomy (aka &quot;lumpectomy&quot;) or a total mastectomy.

      The investigators hypothesize that routine shave margins during partial mastectomy will
      significantly reduce positive margin rate. A positive margin means that cancerous cells were
      detected at the edge of the excised area. This generally mandates a return to the operating
      room for re-excision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some authors have investigated, in a retrospective fashion, the use of routine shave
      margins, where surgeons routinely take additional margins at the time of the initial partial
      mastectomy as a means of obtaining negative margins. While these retrospective studies have
      found that positive margin rates declined using this technique, opponents to this technique
      wonder if this truly results in a higher negative margin rate without compromising cosmesis
      or increasing tissue volume removed. As these studies were retrospective, it was possible
      that the initial resection was smaller than what those who do not routinely take shave
      margins would resect. No one had evaluated the impact of further resection on operative
      time, nor in a blinded fashion, evaluated cosmesis. Further, there had yet to be a
      prospective study to evaluate the impact of this on local recurrence rates. Hence, the
      investigators performed a prospective randomized controlled trial of this technique at Yale.
      The data from this study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the
      technique cut positive margin and re-excision rates in half. Some wondered, however, about
      the external generalizability of these findings, particularly in non-academic settings.
      Hence, a multicenter trial to validate these findings is warranted.

    <description>For the shave group, additional superior, inferior, medial and lateral margins will be removed, oriented, and sent for pathologic evaluation at the local site. Resection of additional anterior and posterior margins will be left to surgeon discretion, as this will depend on if skin or fascia was taken. All surgeons participating in the study will be educated on the expectation of what is considered a &quot;shave margin&quot;. A shave margin is defined as an additional segment of breast tissue taken from each of the superior, inferior, medial, and lateral aspects of the cavity, such that the entire circumference of the cavity is re-excised following this procedure. Orientation of each shaved margin will be done to mark the true margin.</description>
