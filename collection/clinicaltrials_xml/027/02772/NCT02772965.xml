  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adding low dose methotrexate to anti -TNF
      therapy is more effective than treatment with anti-TNF therapy alone in inducing and
      maintaining steroid-free remission for children with Crohn's Disease.

    <description>Time from randomization to treatment failure defined as follows: Failure to achieve remission (SPCDAI &lt; 15) by the week 26 visit; If study initiated on steroids, failure to complete steroid taper by week 16; SPCDAI ≥ 15 (active disease) at two or more consecutive visits beyond the week 26 visit; Hospitalization for active Irritable Bowel Disease or abdominal surgery after week 25; Use of oral prednisone or prednisolone, enteral release budesonide, or intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone for over 10 weeks cumulatively, beyond week 16. (Not inclusive of steroids used as premed for anti-TNF administration or steroids used for conditions other than CD); or discontinuation of anti-TNF or study drug for lack of effectiveness or toxicity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean PROMIS (Patient Reported Outcome Measurement and Information System) Pain Interference T score by treatment arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52 and 104 from randomization</time_frame>
    <description>T scores are a continuous variable. The mean in the general population is 50 (SD=10). Scores above 50 represent higher than average pain interference and scores below 50 represent lower than average pain interference. We will compare the mean of PROMIS Pain Interference T scores at week 52 and week 104 between the treatment groups. Minimal important differences (MIDs) for many PROMIS domains are in the range of 2 to 6.</description>

    <description>Proportion of patients with positive anti-TNF antibody status will be compared between the two treatment groups using the chi-squared test. The year two sample will be collected at a single time point between week 91 and week 104 from randomization. if a sample is not collected in the second year, the sample collected in the first year will be used (week 14).</description>

    <description>Oral methotrexate (MTX): The weekly dose will be 15 mg for children ≥ 40kg, 12.5 mg for children 30 to &lt;40 kg, and 10 mg for children 20 to &lt;30 kg.
A twice per week, 4mg dose of ondansetron will be provided as pre-treatment to prevent nausea.
A 1 mg dose of folic acid per day will be provided. This will help to reduce the risk of side effects in the MTX group.
Drug kits will contain a 3 month supply of each medication. Refills will be provided every 3 months until week 104 unless there is a failure to induce and maintain remission, development of unacceptable toxicity, pregnancy in a female participant, or failure of the participant to attend scheduled study visits.</description>
