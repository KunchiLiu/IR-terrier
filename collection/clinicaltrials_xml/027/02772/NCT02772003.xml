             treatment.

          -  Documentation of history of seizure within previous 5 years.

          -  Pacemaker or other implanted device.

          -  Any condition that, in the clinical judgement of the investigator, would place a
             participant at unreasonably increased risk.

          -  Receiving any other investigational agents ≤ 6 months prior to Registration.
