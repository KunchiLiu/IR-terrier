  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction or HFpEF, represents nearly 50% of all heart
      failure cases and is particularly common in the elderly. The disease has no current
      treatment options. Symptoms typically occur during exertion or exercise and is likely the
      result of increased cardiac and pulmonary congestion as a result of impaired diastolic
      function. Istaroxime is a novel activator of SERCA2a, an important regulator of calcium
      uptake within the myocyte. We will test the hypothesis that Istaroxime will improve
      diastolic function during exercise in HFpEF patients which in turn will reduce cardiac and
      pulmonary congestion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About half of all elderly patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure have
      apparently normal systolic function, so called &quot;heart failure with a preserved ejection
      fraction&quot; or HFpEF. To date, no effective therapy for HFpEF has been found, in part because
      of failure to discern key pathophysiologic pathways.

      An extensive amount of pre-clinical work has identified that altered sarcoplasmic reticulum
      (SR) Ca2+ uptake, storage, and release play a major role in the changes in cardiac
      relaxation associated with aging, especially regarding sequestration of Ca++ by the
      sarcoplasmic reticular Ca++-ATPase (SERCA2a), which causes cardiac muscle relaxation by
      reducing cytosolic Ca++. Istaroxime is a relatively new drug that augments lusitropic
      function by upregulating SERCA2a activity in the heart.

      Because of the clear importance of slowed relaxation in HFpEF, and the evidence that
      depressed SERCA2a activity contributes to the slowed relaxation with aging, the proposed
      study may be establish the &quot;impairment of SERCA2a&quot; hypothesis as a mechanism of impaired
      relaxation in HFpEF subjects.

    <description>Fifteen healthy senior subjects will perform light exercise at a fixed heart rate of 100 beats per minute. Subjects will then be given either placebo infusion (normal saline) or Istaroxime infusion for one hour. Subjects will be blinded to which infusion they are receiving. Subjects will then repeat light exercise at a fixed heart rate of 100 beats per minute. Primary outcome is changes in cardiac filling pressures during exercise.</description>
