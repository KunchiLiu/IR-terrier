  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single site, mechanistic study of asthmatic subjects and healthy,
      non-asthmatic controls which will compare asthmatic smooth muscle cells to non-asthmatic
      smooth muscle cells collected from bronchial biopsies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an asthma exacerbation, contraction of airway smooth muscle leads to airway narrowing.
      Airway smooth muscle contractility is increased by the activation of the intracellular
      protein Rho. The current research seeks to understand the biology of regulation of Rho
      activation in airway smooth muscle in order to further understand the pathophysiology of
      asthma and to reveal potential targets for the development of molecular therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria (Healthy participants):

          1. Male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 70 years

          2. Ability to provide written informed consent and ability to comply with the
             requirements of the study

          3. No hyperreactivity to methacholine (PC20 FEV1 Methacholine &gt;16 mg/mL)

          4. No history of allergic rhinitis/seasonal allergies

        Inclusion Criteria (Asthmatic participants):

          1. Male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 70 years

          2. Ability to provide written informed consent and ability to comply with the
             requirements of the study

          3. History of asthma

          4. No use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma during the past
             6 weeks

          5. Hyperreactivity to methacholine (PC20 FEV1 Methacholine &lt; 8 mg/ml)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The same exclusion criteria will apply to both Sub-studies.

          1. Current smokers, defined by (a) &gt;5 cigarettes smoked in past 12 months, and (b) ≤ 8
             weeks since last time smoking; or former smokers who have a total smoking history ≥10
             pack-years

          2. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or unwilling to practice birth control during participation
             in the study

          3. Subjects with a history of lung disease other than asthma

          4. Subjects with a history of a medical disease, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator may put the subject at extra risk from study-related procedures or
             because the disease may influence the results of the study

          5. Current participation in an investigational drug trial
