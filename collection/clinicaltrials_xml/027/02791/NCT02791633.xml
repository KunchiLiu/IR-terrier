      Observational feasibility study using Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) to assess quality of
      life and 'return to normal life' up to 1 year following emergency laparotomy

  <detailed_description>

      Regaining baseline Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and returning to 'normal life'
      after surgery are of vital importance for patients. Knowledge of the trajectory and degree
      of long-term functional recovery following emergency laparotomy, including the regaining of
      optimal HRQoL is limited as most research relating to this field has been done in patients
      undergoing planned surgery. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the pattern of
      recovery and restoration of baseline HRQoL is also important to researchers wishing to
      assess the full impact of interventions in order to improve outcomes following emergency
      laparotomy. Assessing HRQoL in this surgical population remains a challenge in the absence
      of a validated instrument. The investigators plan to undertake a feasibility study to assess
      utilisation of four patient questionnaires, well established within other surgical
      populations, to describe the quality of early and long-term recovery following emergency
      laparotomy. The investigators will utilise the QoR-15 to describe short-term (in - hospital)
      recovery metrics and versions of the WHO-DAS and the WHOQOL-BREF to describe longer term
      disability free survival and return towards baseline HRQoL. The Post-Operative Morbidity
      Survey (POMS) will help capture the onset of complications at different points during
      recovery. The study also aims to test the feasibility of assessing the impact of
      pre-operative co-morbidities, age, quality of peri-operative and intra-operative care,
      surgical indication and findings as well as post-operative complications on long-term HRQoL.
