  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe current rescue treatment pattern for nucleot(s)ide
      analogue (NA) resistance and assess the real-world treatment outcomes and health resources
      utilization of rescue treatments for drug resistance in a clinical cohort of Chinese
      patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
