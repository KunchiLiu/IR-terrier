    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Determine whether the Physical Therapy (PT) &amp; Fitbit® intervention should proceed to a
           full-scale clinical trial. This decision will be based on three hypotheses: Treatment
           promise (Hypothesis 1A): People in the PT &amp; Fitbit® will walk 1250 more steps/day and
           spend 7 min/day more in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) than the control
           at discharge and at 6 months, Safety (Hypothesis 1B): &lt; 5% will have adverse events
           because of the intervention, Recruitment (Hypothesis 1C): 75 recruited, 90% to complete
           trial, and 85% complete visit at 6 months.

        2. To evaluate the short- and long-term adherence of the PT &amp; Fitbit® intervention.
           Short-term Adherence (Hypothesis 2A): 90% of subjects in the PT&amp; Fitbit® group will
           wear the Fitbit® and participate in goal setting and behavioral counseling while in PT.
           Long-term Adherence (Hypothesis 2B): 75% of PT &amp; Fitbit® will wear the Fitbit® at 6
           months.

        3. To quantify changes in potential underlying mechanisms for increased physical activity.
           Hypothesis 3: Change in self-efficacy for physical activity, walking endurance and
           participation in daily activities will be associated with improvements in physical
           activity.

Our goal is to model our trial off of current physical therapy practice, in which a patient after total knee replacement goes to outpatient physical therapy and receives physical therapy services based on a timeframe planned out by their treating physical therapist. Treatment is then discontinued based on the patient's clinical presentation (ie functional mobility, strength gains, range of motion gains, patient specific goals, etc).</description>

    <description>Participants can read how many steps/day they walked on the Fitbit® daily. The treating physical therapist reviews Fitbit® recorded steps from the previous week and together with the patient sets a new step goal. The physical therapist discusses barriers to meeting step goals are discussed. Self-reward for meeting step/goal is set weekly. Participants in this group will also receive 1-month phone calls for 6-months after completing physical therapy rehabilitation to discuss physical activity, set monthly step count goal, barriers to overcoming goal and to continue to develop a reward system for when the participant achieves their step count goal.</description>
