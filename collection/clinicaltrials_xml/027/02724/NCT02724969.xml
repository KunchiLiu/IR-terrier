  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot randomized trial is to determine the effectiveness, feasibility,
      and acceptability of a mobile, semi-automated text message-based intervention (MILK) to
      prevent perceived low or insufficient milk supply (PIM) in a population of mothers without
      prior breastfeeding experience. PIM is the leading cause of premature breastfeeding
      cessation, and prior work has shown that it is often rooted in low breastfeeding
      self-efficacy and misconceptions about lactation physiology and trajectory. The MILK
      intervention is designed to address PIM, as well as other common breastfeeding problems via
      semi-automated text messages of prenatal and postpartum breastfeeding education and support.
      Messages are time-sensitive (e.g., specific to gestational age, time since delivery) and
      based on the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy (Social Cognitive) Theory; they are also modeled
      from pilot work that investigated how first-time mothers view, manage and describe
      breastfeeding problems. Messages were vetted with experts in clinical lactation, as well as
      pregnant and postpartum women with no other children.

      The MILK intervention will be trialed against a control intervention group, who will receive
      more general perinatal education through the national Text4Baby system. The investigators
      will recruit approximately 115 healthy, pregnant women at 13-25 weeks gestation from Magee
      Women's Hospital clinics and outpatient sites. Women will be randomized via
      computer-generated simple randomization to the experimental or control intervention. Both
      groups will receive text messages 3-5 times per week from week 25 of pregnancy through week
      8 postpartum. Measured outcomes of interest will include perceived breast milk supply,
      breastfeeding confidence, maternal anxiety, breastfeeding exclusivity, and breastfeeding
      duration. Data will be collected at baseline (13-25 gestational weeks), 34-36 gestational
      weeks, and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks postpartum via online survey (Qualtrics) or telephone
      call. To assess the potential longer-term impact of the intervention, breastfeeding
      continuation and exclusivity will be reassessed via telephone at 6 months postpartum.
      Between group and group x time differences in outcome measures will be examined graphically
      and via linear mixed modeling. To inform modifications to MILK, telephone interviews will be
      conducted with a subset of participants in each group to assess and compare intervention
      use, burdens and challenges, and suggested alterations (8 weeks).

      The purpose of the MILK Trial is to examine and compare the effectiveness, feasibility, and
      acceptability of a semi-automated, text-based, theory-driven intervention (&quot;MILK&quot;
      intervention) to prevent perceived insufficient milk and its potential inter-related
      sequelae, including maternal anxiety and early breastfeeding cessation, among mothers
      without breastfeeding experience who intend to exclusively or nearly exclusively breastfeed.
      Specifically, the investigators will:

        1. Determine the effect of the MILK intervention on perceived insufficient milk supply
           (PIM) and related maternal psychological and behavioral sequelae.

           Compared to the control intervention group (&quot;Text4Baby&quot;), the investigators hypothesize
           that MILK participants will have a perception of greater breast milk volume/supply,
           higher self-reported breastfeeding confidence, lower anxiety scores, and longer
           duration of exclusive breastfeeding.

        2. Assess the feasibility of a semi-automated text-based PIM intervention (MILK) for
           mothers.

      The investigators will compare characteristics of women who are and who are not eligible
      for, chose to participate in, and complete this randomized pilot intervention study. The
      investigators will also conduct post-study individual interviews with mothers to determine
      how the interventions were used and perceived (e.g., burden, challenges).
