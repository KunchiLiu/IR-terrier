      The purpose of this study is to obtain information concerning the safety and effective use
      of a protective barrier film in patients experiencing severe incontinence associated
      dermatitis.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label, non randomized prospective case series evaluating 3M Cavilon Advanced
      Barrier Film for the treatment of severe incontinence associated dermatitis (IAD) in the
      presence or absence of continued fecal or fecal and urinary incontinence. The product will
      be applied twice a week for a maximum duration of 3 weeks. Subjects will be followed twice a
      week until healing, for a maximum of 3 weeks or earlier, if discharged from the facility.
      During the study period, the frequency and intensity of their incontinence will be
      monitored, twice a week photographic documentation and IAD site assessments will be
      completed.

    <description>Patients who were experiencing Incontinence Associated Dermatitis (IAD) from exposure to urine, stool or a combination of both urine and stool received an application of the investigational barrier every 72 hours. A skin assessment tool designed for IAD was used to document each patient's IAD score over time.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is the subject 18 years of age or older?

          2. Is the subject in a facility providing nursing care 24h per day?

          3. Does the subject have severe incontinence-associated dermatitis eg breached or
             denuded skin? The ideal candidate would have denudement present.

          4. Is the subject willing to have photos taken of their skin exposed to incontinence and
             permit use of the photos in potential publications?

          5. Is the subject willing to release rights to 3M for use of the photos?

          6. Has the subject signed an Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent
             document and authorized the use and disclosure of protected health information? At
             NS-LIJ, only subjects who are capable of consenting are eligible to enroll. The study
             will not include participants with decisional impairment that would render them
             incapable of informed consent.

        18 years or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are excluded from participation in this study if any of the answers to these
        questions is yes.

          1. If female, is the subject pregnant or breast feeding or have they given birth within
             the 3 weeks preceding the screening visit?

          2. Does the subject have a known allergy to acrylates or cyanoacrylate?

          3. Does the subject have a current pressure ulcer in the area where the skin is affected
             by incontinence?

          4. Does the subject have an active genital herpes infection?

          5. Does the subject have a pre-existing abnormal skin disease on the treatment areas
             that may affect skin assessment?

          6. Does the skin area involved in this study require treatment with a concomitant
             medication or product?

          7. Has the subject been enrolled in any investigational study within 30 days of the
             Screening Visit?

          8. Does the subject have any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator
             should exclude him/her from participating in the study?

          9. Has the subject received antifungal powders within 24 hours prior to enrollment?

         10. Has the subject received cyanoacrylate based skin protectant to the affected areas
             (such as Marathon) within 72 hours prior to enrollment?

         11. Is the facility unwilling to discontinue use for this subject of Dimethicone
             containing wipes on the area where the investigational device will be applied?

         12. Is the facility unwilling to discontinue use for this subject of Chlorhexidine
             Gluconate wipes on the area where the investigational device will be applied?
