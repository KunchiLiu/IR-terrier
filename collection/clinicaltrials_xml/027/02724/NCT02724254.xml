        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patient aged between 18 and 55 years.

          2. External condylomas, 2-30 lesions

          3. Lesions must not be internal. Lesions that originate internally, but are visible
             externally will be considered internal and are not allowed in the study.

          4. Total wart area (diameter x diameter) should not be less than 10mm2 and not more than
             800 mm2

          5. Lesions to be treated should have appeared between 1 to 6 months before screening,
             and patients should not have received any previous condyloma treatment during the
             last 2 months before enrollment.

          6. For female patients: either postmenopausal, taking adequate contraceptive method or
             surgically sterile.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients' total wart area should not have decreased by â‰¥50% between the Screening
             Visit and the Randomization Visit (Week 0).

          2. Patients should not have received genital wart treatment for previous condylomas
             (other than the prior treatment for current condylomas referred at inclusion
             criteria) in the last 12 months before enrollment

          3. Patients with any history or presence of cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             gastro-intestinal, hepatic, renal, metabolic, hematological, neurologic, psychiatric,
             systemic or infectious disease, transplanted or immunosuppressed patients or other
             clinical condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, prevents the patients from
             participating to the study.

          4. Patients with any clinically significant abnormality following review of screening
             laboratory tests, vital signs, full physical examination and ECG. Liver enzymes:
             aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and alkaline
             phosphatase (ALP) must be within normal ranges.

          5. Patients with history or presence of drug or alcohol abuse.

          6. Patients with positive HBs or HBc antigen or anti HCV antibody, or positive results
             for HIV 1 or 2 tests.

          7. Patients using any dermatological drug therapy in the treatment area during the last
             month prior the first application of the study drug.
