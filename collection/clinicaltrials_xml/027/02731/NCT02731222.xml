  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to determine the degree of correlation between
      clinical severity of chronic venous insufficiency and prevalence of onychodystrophy. The
      achievement of the study will require previously a synthetic exposition of the two diseases,
      emphasizing those factors affecting the proposed analysis.

      The final goal of this work is to determine if patients with increased clinical severity of
      chronic venous insufficiency have also a higher prevalence of onychodystrophy.

      Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) is a vascular disease that responds to a number of
      different clinical syndromes and is manifested in the lower extremity, whose nexus is venous
      hypertension (HTV).

      Onychodystrophy on the feet is a progressive non-infectious condition associated with
      various factors, which increases with age. Predominantly occurs in females, presents poor
      aesthetic appearance and often annoyed with footwear.

      The work that is intended to perform is observational, descriptive, analytical,
      cross-sectional and unicentric. In order to prove the feasibility, the researcher will
      conduct a previous pilot study. The study will undertake a preliminary investigation work
      (pilot study) to be performed with a total of 40 patients (aged 40 to 85) who are attending
      the service of Angiology and Vascular Surgery of the Hospital de Sant Pau. These patients
      will be selected to verify their data and then the researchers will perform a statistical
      study from a descriptive and inferential point of view.

    <description>Taking into account the variables and applying the criteria of exclusion and inclusion on the studied sample population composed of men and women, and considering if the limb is affected of chronic venous disease, the investigators have observed and come to the conclusion that in the main hypothesis &quot;patients presenting greater scale of chronic venous insufficiency have higher prevalence of onychodystrophy&quot; and the secondary hypothesis &quot;With a greater degree of venous insufficiency, more affected fingers of onychodystrophy&quot;, the investigators found that the proportion of patients with chronic venous disease and at the same time presence of onicodistrophy on their feet is very low and a high number of patients do not present that condition on their nails</description>

    <description>In terms of the hypothesis &quot;a large number of the studied patients will have more than one dystrophic finger,&quot; the investigators have not been able to extract significant statistical conclusions in the absence of an outcome sufficient and representative . In relation to the hypothesis &quot;the prevalence of the onychodystrophy will be higher in women than in men,&quot; we have observed that OD presence is given greater among women, but also it must be said that the number of female patients studied has been higher than that of male patients</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In what refers to the hypothesis &quot;the prevalence of the onichodystrophy increase with age in the studied group&quot;, the investigators can't extract meaningful conclusions due to the small number of cases studied and that the number of patients found within the fringes of age is very uneven. In general, and grouping patients by strips of age of five in five years, we can see that most of the patients enrolled are between 40 and 45 years old, 60 and 64, and the 70 and 74. However, with the data obtained we can guess the trend that with older age increases the presence of onychodystrophy.
About the hypothesis &quot;The main affected nails will be in the first and fifth toes of the limbs &quot;, we have been able to deduce among the subjects studied (both male and female), that onychodystrophy occurs mainly in the first and fifth toe .</description>

        After collecting data, the investigators will establish the variables, among them the
        results of all clinical data and the scanning Doppler data and CVI symptoms as well as the
        classification CEAP ( from 0 to 6) specifying to what corresponds according to the
        condition of every subject, all these data will be analyzed in relation to the presence
        and intensity of OD in each patient. Also, other variables will be registered that can be
        related to OD: type of footwear, feet deformation, personal history (medical,
        dermatological and medications).

        Finally, the investigators will perform the statistical analysis putting in relation all
        the variables to finally determine if there is or not a correlation between CVI and OD
