  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether patients whose disease grows after
      being treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab respond to ipilimumab (Yervoy®) alone or in
      combination with nivolumab (Opdivo®).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AJCC (2009) stage IV cutaneous melanoma or stage III cutaneous or acral melanoma that
             is judged inoperable. Patients with a history of uveal or mucosal melanoma are not
             eligible.

          -  Measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in
             at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20 mm with conventional
             techniques or as &gt;10 mm with CT scan. Patients must have at least one measurable
             lesion by RECIST and a separate lesion amenable to biopsy.

          -  Histologic proof of melanoma reviewed and confirmed by MSKCC.

          -  Previous treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor with documented progression of
             disease on most recent CT scan. Progression of disease is defined as 1) the
             appearance of a new measureable lesion (&gt;10mm) on cross-sectional imaging or physical
             exam OR 2) enlargement of previously detected lesions on two consecutive imaging
             studies OR 3) enlargement of a previously detected lesion with correlative
             symptomatology on one cross-sectional imaging study. Patients remain eligible if they
             had a previous response to a PD-1 inhibitor, including patients who had a complete
             response, partial response or stable disease. Primary progressing patients are
             defined as those who received anti-PD-1 therapy within 2 months of study enrollment.
             Patients with relapsed disease are defined as those who received their last dose of
             PD-1 blocking antibody ≥2 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients who received adjuvant PD-1 therapy who then develop measurable disease are
             eligible. However, they must have received their last dose of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade
             within two months of enrollment in this trial. They will be stratified with patients
             who have progressive disease.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old.

          -  ECOG performance status = 0 or 1 or Karnofsky Performance Status equivalent

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  WBC &gt;2, 000/mcL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL

               -  Platelets &gt;100,000/mcL

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X MSKCC upper limit of normal

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X MSKCC upper limit of normal for patients with no
                  concurrent liver metastases, OR≤ 5 X MSKCC upper limit of normal for patients
                  with concurrent liver metastases

               -  Serum creatinine &gt;1.5x OR creatinine clearance of at least 40

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug. A woman of childbearing potential
             is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not
             postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman
             over age 50 in the absence of other biologic or physiologic causes.

          -  Women with child bearing potential and men with reproductive potential must be
             willing to practice acceptable methods of contraception.
