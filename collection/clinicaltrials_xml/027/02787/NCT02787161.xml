      HD-FIT is a randomized controlled clinical trial that will analyze the impact of high volume
      online HDF in comparison to high-flux HD on measured physical activity (number of steps
      measured in the dialysis day) as a primary endpoint. The analysis of additional
      accelerometer data, HRQOL and time to recover from a dialysis session will be used as
      exploratory outcomes. The study will also capture safety data, based on intradialytic
      events, hospitalization and mortality. Biochemical (according to the local requirements) and
      drug prescription data will be monitored for pharma-economic analysis. Serum samples will be
      collected for future analysis of additional biomarkers.

      In summary, patients will go through a 4 week run in period on high flux HD. After this,
      patients will be randomized to high volume online HDF or will continue on high flux HD. Both
      groups will be followed for 6 months. Patients will be evaluated for HRQOL and physical
      activity at the baseline. Evaluation will be repeated in 3 and 6-months.

      Data will be analyzed according to an intention-to-treat principle (i.e., according to
      assigned instead of received treatment). With an enrollment target of 110 participants in
      each arm (considering a drop out of 20%) we estimate the 86 patients will complete the
      follow up in each arm, what will provide the trial a 90% power to detect a 20% effect with
      respect to the primary outcome (predefined as a 20% increase in average total steps at the
      dialysis day in the HDF group compared to the HD group). Because of the nature of the
      intervention, it will not possible to blind the patients, the local study nurses, or the
      investigators for the treatment assignment.

      Twelve dialysis centers will be invited to participate. Each center will receive two 5008S
      machines and Cordiax dialyzers to be used in the study of 10 patients in each center.
      Centralized randomization will based on a 1:1 protocol, stratified by participating center.

    <description>To capture activity in the study, we will use the Actigraph ™ device to measure acceleration and count steps during 7 days at baseline, 3 and 6 months evaluations, according to a previously described protocol for dialysis patients. A 4s step filter is an intrinsic property of the Actigraph ™ that screens out erroneous steps that might result as from shuffling, standing up, sitting up, sitting down, and vibrations from a moving vehicle. The Actigraph ™ is lightweight (35g), clips at the waist, and provides feedback with on-instrument digital display of step counts. It interfaces with the internet via bluetooth, allowing upload of date and time stamped step counts.</description>

    <description>HRQOL will be assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months of follow- up with the Kidney Disease Quality of Life - Short Form (KDQOL-SF), adapted and validated to Brazilian Portuguese. This questionnaire covers different domains to face the multidimensional nature of HRQOL. The eight domains of the SF-36 can be summarized in two summary scores, one for physical functioning (the physical composite score [ PCS]) and one for mental functioning (the mental composite score [MCS]). Questionnaires will be applied at the baseline, and 3 and 6 months in both arms. In addition, we will apply the question, &quot; How long does it take to recover from a dialysis session?&quot; . This test has been validated in HD studies, since it is interpreted easily, is easy to respond, shows stability over time by test-retest, shows both convergent and divergent validity, and is sensitive to change.</description>
