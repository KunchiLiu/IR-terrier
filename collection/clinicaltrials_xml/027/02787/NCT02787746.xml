      This study is a multi-center, single-arm, open labeling research, which the objective is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of donepezil in Alzheimer's disease( AD) patients in
      China, and investigate the relationship between Apo-E gene type with adverse events of
      donepezil.

    <description>Patients is treated with Aricept® 5 mg/day for 4 weeks, and then titrated to 10 mg/day for the remaining 20 weeks of study period. Aricept® should be taken in the evening, just prior to retiring. If patients cannot endure 10mg/d，reduce to 5mg/d or stop for 2 weeks then increase again to 10mg/d. Those cannot endure the titration of 2nd time should be regarded as to abandon research.</description>
