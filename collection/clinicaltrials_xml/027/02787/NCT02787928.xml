  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States the incidence of cesarean deliveries have increased over the last
      several decades and is currently approximately 30% nationwide. The anesthesia and analgesia
      for elective c-sections vary between institutions.

      Parturients present a unique challenge for the anesthesiologist as the mother has to care
      not only for herself, but also for the newborn postpartum. While intrathecal opioids provide
      adequate pain relief, they do so at the cost of bothersome side effects for patients, such
      as pruritus and nausea/vomiting.

      Intrathecal hydromorphone has started to be explored as a new option for intrathecal
      analgesia. A study done by Beatty et al. showed in a retrospective review that 40 mcg of
      intrathecal dilaudid was safe and effective as compared to intrathecal morphine for
      analgesia after cesarean delivery. Additionally they showed no difference in side effect
      profiles of the two medications. Mhyre et al. investigated the use of 100 mcg of intrathecal
      dilaudid with hyperbaric bupivacaine in varying dosages for labor analgesia. The results
      were inconclusive, but the dosage of hydromorphone was reported to be without adverse
      effects.

      Virginia Commonwealth University Health Systems has successfully instituted the use of
      intrathecal morphine with superior analgesia but with undesired side effects, most notably
      pruritus. Recent drug shortages of duramorph have prompted investigators to seek alternative
      options for post cesarean section analgesia. The investigators are interested in determining
      the dose, efficacy, and side effect profile of intrathecal hydromorphone. Although our
      institution has never utilized intrathecal hydromorphone for our patient population, it has
      been studied at various other institutions where it has been found to be safe and
      efficacious with an acceptable side effect profile.

    <description>This will be a prospective up/down dosage study. After obtaining informed consent, eligible participants will be part of an up/down dose titration study. This first phase of our study will be conducted using intrathecal (spinal) hydromorphone to determine an appropriate dose range for our study population. Study drug dose will initially be 40 mcg. The only deviation from the current standard of care will be that patients will be given hydromorphone intrathecally instead of morphine. The rest of the care provided will be standard of care and per current practices at VCU labor and delivery floor.</description>

    <description>Intrathecal hydromorphone will be administered in an up/down dosage fashion. A successful dose will be defined as a patient not requiring additional narcotic pain medication outside of the standard VCU order set, which includes PRN oxycodone 5 and 10 mg every 4 hours and a one time PRN 1 mg hydromorphone IV. Failure of a dose will be if patient requires additional narcotic pain medication outside of these parameters</description>
