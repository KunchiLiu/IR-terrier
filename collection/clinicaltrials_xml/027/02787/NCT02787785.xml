  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MADIT S-ICD trial is designed to evaluate if subjects with a prior myocardial
      infarction, diabetes mellitus and a relatively preserved ejection fraction of 36-50% will
      have a survival benefit from receiving a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator
      (S-ICD) when compared to those receiving conventional medical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, subjects will be randomized to receive a subcutaneous implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator or Conventional Medical Therapy (CMT). Randomization will be
      stratified by enrolling site, in a 2:1 (S-ICD:CMT) scheme. Length of follow-up for each
      subject will be dependent on the date of entry into the study, since all subjects will be
      followed to a common study termination date.

          -  Age â‰¥ 65 years on date of consent

          -  Diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, non-insulin injectable
             and/or insulin for the past 3 calendar months or longer prior to consent date

          -  LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of 36-50% documented by imaging (preferably by MRI or
             echocardiographic methods), within 12 calendar months before consent date and at
             least 3 calendar months after most recent Myocardial Infarction (MI), percutaneous
             coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).

          -  One or more clinically documented, enzyme-positive myocardial infarctions, more than
             3 calendar months prior to consent date*. (If enzyme information and clinical
             documentation is not available, there must be a clear evidence of prior silent
             myocardial infarction identified as either new pathologic Q waves on ECG or imaging
             documentation of an infarcted area (left ventricular angiography/ nuclear scan/ MRI)
             Note: MI qualification based on the Universal Definition of MI)

          -  Qualifying 12-lead ECG within 6 calendar months before consent date and at least 3
             calendar months after most recent MI, PCI or CABG. (The qualifying ECG* can be sinus
             rhythm or atrial fibrillation (patients with persistent or permanent atrial
             fibrillation should have a controlled ventricular response &lt;100 bpm on consent date)
             *QRS duration on the qualifying ECG &gt;90 msec)

          -  Passing S-ICD Screening ECG performed per applicable user's manual on or after the

          -  Angiographic evidence of coronary disease in a patient that is a candidate for
             coronary revascularization and is likely to undergo CABG or PCI in the next 3
             calendar months

          -  High risk for arterial embolism (e.g. presence of mobile left ventricular thrombus)

          -  Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, aortic valvular heart disease,

          -  Baseline body mass index &gt; 45 kg/m2

          -  On a heart transplant list or likely to undergo heart transplant within one calendar

          -  Presence of any other disease, other than the subject's cardiac disease, that in the
             opinion of the investigator is likely to significantly reduce the patient's
             likelihood of survival for the duration of the trial (e.g. cancer, liver failure).

          -  Unwillingness or inability to cooperate with the protocol

          -  Resides at such a distance from the enrolling site so travel to follow-up visits
