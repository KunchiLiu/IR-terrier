  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      middle-aged men at risk of poverty increases their fruit and vegetable intake over a period
      of 4 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 men (&gt; 30 years, living alone) with a low SES will be randomly assigned to a
      control or intervention group while controlling for food bank use. The intervention group
      will receive free fresh fruits and vegetables consisting of 2 daily portions of their
      favorite variety over a period of 4 weeks which will be provided to them once per week.

      All participants will be asked to fill out a demographic questionnaire as well as a Food
      Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), a questionnaire on amounts and variety of fruits and
      vegetables consumed and a 24-h-food-recall questionnaire. All questionnaires will be
      administered by trained interviewers. During the study period, the 24h-food recall
      questionnaire will be administered four more times; two times before the 4-week intervention
      period and two times during the last two weeks of the intervention period. After the 4-week
      intervention period, interviewers will administered the FFQ, the questionnaire on amounts
      and variety, and the FIES.

      Participants assigned to the control group will receive a fruit and vegetable basket after 4
      weeks after baseline.

      All participants will receive gift certificates for local supermarkets in the amount of
      35,00 €.

After baseline assessment of food intake patterns, the intervention will consist of providing free fruits and vegetables of their choice for a period of four weeks which will be provided fresh each week. At baseline and at the end of the 8-week period, a FFQ and a questionnaire on consumed fruit and vegetable amounts and variety will be administered.</description>
