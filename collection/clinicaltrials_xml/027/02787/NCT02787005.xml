      This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with docetaxel-based
      chemotherapy. Participants will be enrolled into one of three cohorts: Cohort 1
      (participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1]-positive, measurable disease),
      Cohort 2 (participants with PD-L1 negative, measurable disease), or Cohort 3 (participants
      with bone-metastases and non-measurable disease)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has histologically- or cytologically-confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without
             small cell histology. Disease must be either metastatic or locally confined
             inoperable disease that cannot be treated with definitive intent (no chance for a
             curative intervention).

          -  Has supplied tumor tissue from either a newly obtained biopsy or an archival specimen
             from a site not previously irradiated. Participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 with
             visceral/measurable lesions must provide a newly obtained biopsy performed after the
             last line of systemic therapy and an archival specimen, if available. Participants in
             Cohort 3 must provide an archival specimen.

          -  Has been treated with:

          -  At least 1 targeted endocrine therapy (defined as second generation antiandrogen
             therapies that include but are not limited to abiraterone acetate with prednisone,
             enzalutamide, and next generation targeted agents such as ARN-509).

          -  At least 1 regimen/line of chemotherapy that contained docetaxel.

          -  No more than 2 chemotherapy regimens.

          -  No more than 3 regimens/lines of the aforementioned treatments (having
             failed/progressed on chemotherapy and targeted endocrine therapy).

          -  Has documented prostate cancer progression within 6 months prior to screening, as
             determined by the Investigator, by means of one of the following: 1) PSA progression
             as defined by a minimum of 3 rising PSA levels with an interval of ≥1 week between
             each assessment where the PSA value at screening should be ≥2 ng/mL, OR, 2)
             Radiographic disease progression in soft tissue or bone with or without PSA
             progression

          -  Has ongoing androgen deprivation with total serum testosterone &lt;50 ng/dL (&lt;2.0 nM).

          -  Participants receiving bone resorptive therapy (including but not limited to
             bisphosphonate or Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand [RANK-L
             inhibitor]) must have been on stable doses for ≥4 weeks prior to first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Has a performance status of 0, 1 or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) Performance Scale

          -  Males of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception, starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the
             last dose of study drug.

          -  Demonstrates adequate organ function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigation

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study drug.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of study drug or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at Baseline)
             from adverse events due to mAbs administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or external beam
             radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug or who has not

             administered agent.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that has had progression or has required active
             treatment in the last 3 years. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin
             and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative
             therapy.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis.

          -  Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years

             drugs).

          -  Has evidence of interstitial lung disease and/or a history of (non-infectious)

          -  Has previously participated in any other pembrolizumab (MK-3475) trial, or received
             prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1, anti-PD ligand 1
             [anti-PD-L1], and anti-PD-L2 [including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug
             specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways]).

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
