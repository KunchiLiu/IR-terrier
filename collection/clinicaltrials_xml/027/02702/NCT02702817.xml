  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two-year double-masked trial of over-the-counter dosage of naproxen sodium vs placebo in 200
      cognitively normal participants with a parental or multiplex first-degree family history
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Primary outcomes are decline in cognitive function and
      slope of change in a summary Alzheimer Progression Score derived from serial assessment of
      neuroimaging, biochemical, and sensori-neural biomarker indicators of pre-clinical disease
      -- all believed likely to reflect progress of preclinical AD in this high risk cohort.
      Approximately 2/3 of participants have volunteered also for serial lumbar punctures for
      analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. A two-year off-treatment delayed-washout phase is planned
      to examine sustained treatment effects and evidence of disease modification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial has enrolled 200 cognitively normal persons aged 60+ with either a parental
      history of AD or a history of two or more affected first-degree relatives. Persons aged
      55-59 may be admitted if their current age is &lt;= 15 years younger than AD onset in their
      index relative. Such persons are at approximately 3-fold increased risk of AD dementia. We
      expect a majority of them to show evidence of progressive pre-clinical AD. Participants are
      randomized 1:1 to receive the common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen
      in over-the-counter dosage (naproxen sodium 220 mg) or identical-appearing placebo tablets
      twice daily. At baseline and at three follow-up visits (3 months, 12 months and 24 months
      after randomization) they are tested for cognitive abilities and undergo brain imaging with
      both structural and functional MRI. They are also tested for sensori-neural capacities in
      olfactory identification and in the ability to discern spoken language in a distracting
      environment (to test central auditory processing). About 2/3 of participants have also
      volunteered to undergo a series of lumbar punctures for donation of cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF), which is assayed for several biochemical markers of AD that are now understood to be
      present for a decade or longer before the onset of symptoms. As well, their plasma and CSF
      are assayed for presence of naproxen and for numerous markers of inflammatory processes
      (cytokines and chemokines). The central hypothesis is that administration of naproxen will
      not only suppress these inflammatory markers but will also slow or reverse the progress of
      change in cognition and in biomarkers of the pre-clinical stage of AD. Upon completion of
      two years of treatment, participants are to be followed for a further two years to observe
      whether treatment-related changes are sustained -- indicating that the treatment effects
      represent modification of the disease process itself, as opposed to a temporary change in
      brain function.
