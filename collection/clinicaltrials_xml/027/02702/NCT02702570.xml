  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are planning to recruit approximately 30 study participants aged 50 years
      and older that will undergo a 4 week attention and emotion regulation intervention. The
      intervention systematically targets thoughts, emotions and behavior in order to promote
      quality of life and advance successful brain aging. The investigators will assess the
      feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants for an attention and emotion regulation
      intervention. In addition, the investigators will determine the efficacy of the intervention
      to enhance and promote quality of life, sustained attention, emotions, motivation and
      cognitive health.

    <textblock>
      The CASA model is developed here in the investigators program (Geda et al) based on
      neuroscience and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The rationale for the study is
      that the cortico-cortical network linking the prefrontal cortex with the mesial temporal
      lobe is susceptible to the wear and tear of day to day life such as stress and emotional
      distress. The investigators hypothesize that the CASA intervention will promote emotional
      and cognitive health by targeting this network.
