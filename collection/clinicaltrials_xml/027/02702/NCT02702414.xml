    <textblock>
      This is a efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) as monotherapy in
      participants with previously systemically treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Study
      participants may receive pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks for up to 35 administrations (up
      to approximately 2 years).

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of
      pembrolizumab given as monotherapy in participants with previously systemically treated HCC

          -  Has a predicted life expectancy &gt;3 months.

          -  Has measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
             1.1 as confirmed by the blinded central imaging vendor.

             sorafenib or else intolerance to sorafenib.

          -  Participants with chronic infection by Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) who are untreated are
             allowed on study. In addition, participants with successful HCV treatment (defined as
             sustained virologic response [SVR] 12 or SVR 24) are allowed as long as 4 weeks have
             passed between completion of HCV therapy and start of study drug.

          -  Is willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study

          -  Demonstrates adequate organ function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy, herbal/complementary oral or
             IV medicine, or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of
             study drug. Participant must also have recovered from associated therapy (i.e., to

             to control their encephalopathy are not allowed.

          -  Had a solid organ or hematologic transplant.

             drugs).

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any

          -  Has received locoregional therapy to liver (transcatheter chemoembolization [TACE],
             transcatheter embolization [TAE], radiation, radioembolization, or ablation) or major
             surgery to liver or other site within 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.
