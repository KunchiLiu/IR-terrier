  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability of ascending doses of
      SB-318. SB-318 is an intravenously delivered Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) Therapeutic for
      genome editing. It inserts a correct copy of the α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) gene into the
      Albumin locus in hepatocytes with the goal of lifelong therapeutic production of the IDUA
      enzyme.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to provide long term expression of IDUA and improve the
      current clinical outcome of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) therapy in subjects with attenuated MPS I, a recessive lysosomal
      storage disorder that results from mutations in the gene encoding IDUA. SB-318 is a
      therapeutic for ZFN-mediated genome editing which will be delivered by adeno-associated
      virus (AAV)-derived vectors. SB-318 is intended to function by placement of the corrective
      copy of the IDUA transgene into the genome of the subject's own hepatocytes, under the
      control of the highly expressed endogenous albumin locus, and is expected to provide
      permanent, liver-specific expression of iduronidase for the lifetime of an MPS I patient.
