    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group comparison of the effects of FX006
      and Triamcinolone Acetonide Injectable Suspension, USP (referred to as TCA IR in the
      protocol) on blood glucose in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, single-dose study design. The
      study will be conducted in male and female patients ≥ 40 years of age with osteoarthritis of
      the knee and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Approximately 36 patients will be randomized to one
      of the two treatment groups (1:1) and treated with a single intra-articular (IA) injection
      of:

        -  40 mg FX006 or

        -  40 mg TCA IR

      Blood glucose levels will be evaluated for a total of 3 weeks (one week prior to injection
      and two weeks post IA injection) using a continuous glucose monitoring device. Following
      randomization and IA injection, patients will return for follow up visits at Day 8, Day 15
      and Week 6/Day 43.
