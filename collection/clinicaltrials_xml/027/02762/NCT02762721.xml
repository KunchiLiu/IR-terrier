  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the frequency of FGFR2 fusions in
      archived intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) or mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma
      (HCC-CCA) tumor samples
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, observational study of archived human tissue samples; no
      surgical procedures will be required and no treatment will be provided as part of this
      study. Approximately 150 archived tissue samples obtained from patients with iCCA or mixed
      HCC-CCA will be analyzed for somatic alteration status and will include
      cholangiocarcinoma-specific FGFR2 fusion isoforms.

        One hundred and fifty archived tumor tissue samples from patients with iCCA or mixed
        HCC-CCA will be collected from five to fifteen research sites in the United States and
        Italy and/or from commercially available sources. No new surgical procedures will be
        required and no treatment will be provided as part of this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  If required by law or local regulations (i.e., the sample is from an identifiable
             subject), signed written informed consent should be granted prior to use of the
             sample in the study

          -  â‰¥ 18 years of age

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed iCCA or mixed HCC-CCA, who are/were
             eligible for systemic therapy (samples collected prior to initiation of the systemic
             therapy may be submitted for testing)

          -  Have one or more formalin fixed and paraffin embedded blocks available. If blocks are
             not evaluable, 7-10 unstained, non-baked slides with 5-micron thick sections with at
             least 20% tumor tissue should be available. (Potential participants who are scheduled
             to undergo surgical treatment may agree to provide surplus of tissues not required
             for diagnosis and have to provide informed consent prior to the surgery.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not applicable: Patients must meet all of the inclusion criteria.
