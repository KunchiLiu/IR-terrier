  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, two-site, two-arm, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial will
      examine the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a polyurethane tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (TDF) vaginal ring when used continuously for 84 consecutive days by sexually active women.

      The primary objective is to assess the safety of TDF vaginal rings when used continuously
      for 84 days by healthy, HIV-uninfected, sexually active women, as compared with a placebo
      vaginal ring.

             months and that has been appropriately treated may be considered for eligibility.

          -  At Screening or Enrollment, has a clinically apparent Grade 1 or higher pelvic exam
             finding (observed by study clinician or designee) per the DAIDS Table for Grading the
             Severity of Adult and Pediatric AEs, Addendum 1, Female Genital Grading Table for Use
             in Microbicide Studies.

        Note: Cervical friability bleeding associated with speculum insertion and/or specimen
        collection judged to be within the range of normal according to the clinical judgment of
        the PL/designee is considered expected non-menstrual bleeding and is not exclusionary.

        - Pap result Grade 2 or higher according to the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in
        Microbicide Studies Addendum 1 to the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric AEs,

        Note: Women 21 years of age or older with a documented normal result within the 12 months
        prior to enrollment need not have Pap smear during the screening period. Women with a
        Grade 1 abnormal Pap smear can be enrolled upon completion of the initial phase of
        evaluation if no current treatment is indicated (based on local standard of care for
        management of abnormal cervical cytology). Need for a repeat Pap within 6 months does not
        preclude enrollment prior to that result becoming available.

          -  At Screening, has severe pelvic relaxation such that either the vaginal walls or the
             uterine cervix descend beyond the vaginal introitus with Valsalva maneuver.

          -  Has any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude informed
             consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study outcome
             data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives.
