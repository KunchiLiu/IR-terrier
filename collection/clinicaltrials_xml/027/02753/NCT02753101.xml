  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain can result from injured or inflamed nerves, as happens in people suffering from
      sciatica and CRPS. These nerve injuries or regions of nerve irritation are often the cause
      of pain in these conditions, but the current diagnostic tools have proven quite limited in
      pinpointing these areas. Several studies have implicated involvement of sigma-1 receptors in
      the generation and perpetuation of chronic pain conditions, while others are investigating
      anti sigma-1 receptor drugs for the treatment of chronic pain. Using [18F]FTC-146, a sigma-1
      receptor (S1R) detector and experimental radiotracer, and positron emission
      tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), we hope to learn the best approach to
      identifying the site of nerve injury/inflammation (or other tissue injury/inflammation) as
      they related to painful conditions, and, therefore, help identify the source of pain
      generation. We will characterizing the disease in patients suffering from complex regional
      pain syndrome (CRPS) and chronic sciatica, with the overarching goal of optimizing or
      developing improved pain treatment regimens.

      The broad objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine the dosimetry of [18F]FTC-146

        -  To evaluate the safety of [18F]FTC-146 after a single administration

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and ability of the radiotracer to reflect S1R
           expression in healthy subjects and specific patient subpopulations .

      The study is not designed to induce any physiological/pharmacological effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are either pain free or will be recruited based on established criteria for
      sciatica or CRPS. Patients outside the of age range (&lt; 18 years), and those with
      contraindications for MRI or PET scanning will be excluded. A signed consent will be
      obtained from willing participants.

      For the PET/MRI scan, the participants will be injected with 10 mCi ± 1 mCi of [18F]FTC-146
      via the antecubital vein in a bolus injection. For evaluation of plasmatic kinetics, blood
      samples will be taken from a subset of recruited subjects over 2 hours after injection of
      radiotracer to estimate plasma activity using a gamma counter. After injection, PET and MRI
      scans will be acquired simultaneously using a hybrid PET/MRI scanner. Throughout scanning,
      participants will be monitored for blood pressure, temperature, heart rate and pulse
      oximetry. Participants will be asked to void their bladder as frequently as they can to
      reduce radiation exposure. Following the scan, participants will be contacted to check for
      adverse drug events, and any events will be recorded in the case report. For a subset of
      patients, small blood samples (2 teaspoons) for blood chemistry and hematology will be
      collected on the day of scanning and at follow-up visits at 24 hours and 1 week after
      injection. The biodistribution of radiotracer will be analyzed using regions of interest
      (ROI) marked on anatomical structures on magnetic resonance images and quantifying the
      signal in PET images within the same ROIs. Pharmacokinetic information will be derived using
      mathematical modeling.
