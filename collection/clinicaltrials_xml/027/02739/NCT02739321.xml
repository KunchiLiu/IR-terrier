      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the Sound
      To Sleep System™ in improving the sleep quality of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
      (ASD). The Sound To Sleep System™ is a mattress foundation designed to improve sleep quality
      in individuals with ASD and sleep disturbance by providing mattress vibrations that
      accompany and sync with auditory stimulation. For the present study, the primary objectives
      are as follows:

      * SA1 - To determine whether the use of the Sound To Sleep System™ in ASD-affected children
      with sleep disturbances is well tolerated as defined by group drop-out proportion due to
      issues with the mattress technology.

      The study will also explore the following objectives:

        -  SA2 - To determine the efficacy of the Sound To Sleep System™ in improving sleep
           quality as measured by parent reported sleep quality in ASD-affected children with
           sleep disturbances. (Please note SA2 was changed from clinician-rated to parent-rated
           because we were not able to collect clinician-rated sleep quality information).

        -  SA3 - To determine the tolerability of the Sound To Sleep System™ as defined by study
           drop-out due to any reason and caregiver ratings of ease of mattress technology use.

        -  SA4 - To determine whether use of the mattress technology improves functioning as
           defined by secondary outcome measures.

      The present study aims to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of a new mattress
      technology in improving the sleep quality of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
      Clinical and population studies indicate that children with ASD exhibit elevated rates of
      sleep disturbance compared to their typically-developing peers and that 50% to 80% of
      children with ASD have sleep problems. Sleep disturbance can include bedtime resistance,
      sleep onset latency, nighttime awakenings, decreased total sleep time, early morning
      awakenings, and other measures of sleep quality. Sleep problems in children with ASD are
      associated with greater externalizing and internalizing behavior problems during the waking
      day, poorer adaptive functioning, and can cause significant parental stress. Previous
      studies have examined the effectiveness of behavioral treatments, environmental
      modifications, melatonin, and psychopharmacologic treatments in decreasing the rates of
      sleep disturbance. However, none of these approaches have identified treatments that are
      effective for all ASD-affected children with sleep difficulties. Given the high prevalence
      of sleep disturbance in this population, there is a great need to identify additional
      treatments that may improve sleep in children with ASD.

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the Sound
      To Sleep System™ using a single blind (actigraphy scoring blinded), cross-over design. The
      Sound To Sleep System™ is a mattress foundation designed to improve sleep quality in
      individuals with ASD and sleep disturbance by providing mattress vibrations that accompany
      and sync with auditory stimulation. For the present study, the primary objectives are as
      follows:

      SA1 - To determine whether the use of the Sound To Sleep System™ in ASD-affected children
      with sleep disturbances is well tolerated as defined by group drop-out proportion due to
      issues with the mattress technology.

      The study will also explore the following objectives:

      SA2 - To determine the efficacy of the Sound To Sleep System™ in improving parent-reported
      sleep quality in ASD-affected children with sleep disturbances.

      SA3 - To determine the tolerability of the Sound To Sleep System™ as defined by study
      drop-out due to any reason and caregiver ratings of ease of mattress technology use.

      SA4 - To determine whether use of the mattress technology improves functioning as defined by
      secondary outcome measures.
