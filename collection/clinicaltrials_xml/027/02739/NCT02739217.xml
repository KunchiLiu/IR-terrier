      This is a Phase 2, single-centre, single-arm, open-label study of the safety, tolerability,
      and effects on biomarkers of PBI-4050 in subjects with Alström syndrome. Approximately 18
      subjects will be enrolled. The duration of study participation is approximately 34 weeks for
      each subject and comprises of 9 on site visits and telephone contacts in between visits.

          -  Subject has a documented diagnosis of Alström syndrome

          -  Subject on diabetes treatment has been receiving the same antidiabetic agent(s) for a
             minimum of 1 month before screening.

          -  Subject is able and willing to self-monitor blood glucose level at home or can obtain
             adequate assistance from care givers.

             at screening and agree to use adequate birth control from screening throughout the
             study and for 30 days after the last Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP)
             administration.

          -  If a male subject has not been vasectomized at least 6 months before screening and
             partners with a woman of childbearing potential, he must be willing to use an

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has recent or on-going infection requiring systemic treatment with an
             anti-infective agent within 30 days before screening.

          -  Subject has a history of chronic alcohol or other substance abuse as determined at
             screening.

          -  Woman who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning a pregnancy during the course of
