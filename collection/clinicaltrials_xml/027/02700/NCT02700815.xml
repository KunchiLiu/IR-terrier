  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised, controlled multi-centre parallel group trial will assess the efficacy and
      tolerability of a topical formulation gel of the combination of diclofenac and capsaicin in
      comparison to gels with diclofenac alone, capsaicin alone, and placebo for the treatment of
      acute back pain or neck pain
