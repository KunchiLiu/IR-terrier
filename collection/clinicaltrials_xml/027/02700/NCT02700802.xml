      The Feed1st proposed program of research will promote health of informal caregivers with a
      hospitalized child by testing a self-management intervention that addresses the widely
      overlooked problem of caregiver hunger. As many as 54% of parents and other informal
      caregivers of hospitalized children struggle with insufficient food to nourish themselves
      and their family during and after a hospital stay. Hunger impairs caregiver physical and
      mental health by depleting energy for self-care, emotional self-regulation, and supportive
      interactions with the child, the family, and the formal caregiver team. The long-term
      objective of the Feed1st program is to sustainingly alleviate unnecessary suffering due to
      hunger among families with hospitalized children. Established in partnership with nursing
      and chaplaincy leadership at our children's hospital and the Greater Chicago Food
      Depository, the Feed1st program currently operates self-serve food pantries on four
      inpatient units and the emergency department in our children's hospital on Chicago's South
      Side. Since 2010, Feed1st has provided nearly 8500 pounds of food to at least 4,000
      individuals and 1500 households via the self-serve food pantries in the children's hospital.
      Over this same period, our team has also created a system for efficiently connecting
      families to community-based resources for hunger and other basic needs. This system,
      CommunityRx, integrates with our electronic medical record system and connects caregivers to
      a community health information specialist for navigation assistance. Leveraging both Feed1st
      and CommunityRx, we are using a randomized controlled trial, determine the health and health
      care impacts of a self-management intervention versus usual care to reduce informal
      caregiver hunger during and after a child's hospitalization. Findings from this study will
      be used to create a sustainable solution to the root cause problem of hunger among informal
      caregivers of a hospitalized child and will advance sensor-based methods for studying
      informal caregiver self-management behaviors, particularly in intimate settings.

    <description>Informal caregivers suffering from household food insecurity will be connected to a community health information specialist to help access food and other resources in their community to meet their health and social needs. Informal caregivers will be recruited within 48 hours of their child's hospital admission.</description>
