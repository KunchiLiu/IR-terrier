    <textblock>
      Clinical trial to determine the efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of the Bladder
      EpiCheck test compared to the gold standard cystoscopy and pathology in patients under
      monitoring for recurrence of bladder cancer.

    <textblock>
      The Bladder EpiCheck test is an in vitro diagnostic device for the detection of DNA
      methylation patterns in urine that are associated with bladder cancer. It is intended for
      use as a noninvasive method for monitoring for tumor recurrence in conjunction with
      cystoscopy inpatients previously diagnosed with bladder cancer This is a, multicenter,
      prospective, blinded study to evaluate the efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of a novel
      methylation test for the detection of recurrent Urothelial Cell Carcinoma in patients with a
      history of bladder cancer undergoing surveillance.
