      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 doses of Tetravalent Dengue
      Vaccine Candidate (TDV) in preventing symptomatic dengue fever of any severity and due to
      any of the four dengue virus serotypes in 4 to 16 year old participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine being tested in this study is Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate
      (TDV). TDV is being tested to protect people against dengue fever and to look at long-term
      safety results. This study will look at the success rate of TDV in preventing dengue fever
      (vaccine efficacy) and long-term side effects of the vaccine.

      The study will be conducted in 3 parts. Part 1 will evaluate vaccine efficacy (VE) and will
      last a minimum of 15 months. Part 2 will be for an additional 6 months to evaluate VE. Part
      3 will evaluate long-term safety by following participants for side effects and will last an
      additional 3 years. Participants may be enrolled into a dry-run to commence and test febrile
      surveillance methodology; this dry-run part may be upto 10 months prior to receiving study
      injection, however, will not be applicable to all trials sites or participants.

      Approximately 20,100 participants will be enrolled into the study and randomly assigned (by
      chance) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the participants
      and study doctors during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive subcutaneous injection) - this is a solution that looks like
           the study drug but has no active ingredient

      All participants will receive a single injection on Day 1 and Day 90. A subset of
      participants will be asked to record any local symptoms at the injection site (Pain,
      Erythema and Swelling) in a diary card for 7 days after each injection. The same subset of
      participants will also be asked to record any systemic symptoms (child &lt;6 years: fever,
      irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, loss of appetite and child ≥6 years: fever, headache,
      asthenia, malaise and myalgia) in a diary card for 14 days after each injection.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 4.75 years excluding the dry-run. Participants will make multiple
      visits to the clinic and will be contacted at least every week for the entire study
      duration.
