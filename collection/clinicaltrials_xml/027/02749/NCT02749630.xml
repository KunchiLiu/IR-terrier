  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of repeat dosing of intravenous (IV)
      UTTR1147A. The study will consist of a repeat dose escalation in healthy volunteers (HV) and
      a repeat dose escalation in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) patients across multiple sites.
