      This qualitative study will identify which domains are most important to metabolic and
      bariatric surgical patients, their families/partners, and their caregivers and which valid
      patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) will best capture this information. Patient and
      caregiver feedback will be gathered on the local, regional, and national implementation
      PROMs in the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program
      (MBSAQIP) as well as on patient-reported results and data presentation.
