  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a prevalent, destructive, and costly chronic disease. In 2008, 37% of Canadian
      adults were measured as overweight, and 25% as obese. Obesity is a risk factor for a number
      of serious health problems, including type 2 diabetes, asthma, gallbladder disease,
      osteoarthritis, chronic back pain, several types of cancers (i.e., colorectal, kidney,
      breast, endometrial, ovarian and pancreatic cancers) and cardiovascular disease (i.e.,
      hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease). In 2008, it was
      estimated that the annual economic burden of obesity in Canada was $4.6 billion. Given the
      economic strain and widespread health risks of obesity, there is a clear need to provide
      effective interventions for obesity.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to examine the role of ACT-based interventions in
      long-term weight maintenance. The proposed study will examine the role of value consistent
      behaviour, acceptance skills, and mindfulness skills in promoting long-term weight-related
      health behaviours. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an empirically supported
      psychological intervention that emphasizes value consistent behaviours, acceptance skills
      and mindfulness skills.

      For the proposed study, participants will receive specific sessions from the psychologist on
      value consistent behaviour, acceptance skills, and mindfulness skills. Their self-reported
      perceived consistency with their values and health behaviours will be recorded along with
      their weight at each session for the duration of the year-long program. The investigators
      will also assess their acceptance and mindfulness skills at 6 months and 1 year. The
      investigators will continue to monitor their value-consistent behaviour, acceptance skills,
      mindfulness skills, weight-related health behaviours, weight and medication use at 6 months,
      1 year and 5 years post the completion of the Partners for Healthier Weight program.

      Partners for Healthier Weight is a hospital affiliated program that offers an empirically
      based, multidisciplinary, year-long weight management program. Participants attend weekly
      sessions for the first 6 months of the program. Sessions are facilitated by a dietician,
      psychologist and physiotherapist. For the second 6 months of the program, participants
      attend bi-weekly sessions. Participants are monitored by a nurse for the duration of the
      program.

      Results will be compared to past participants who received standard treatment of care who
      are registered in the investigators patient database. Participants who consented to be in
      the patient database will be contacted and asked to complete the follow up measures.
