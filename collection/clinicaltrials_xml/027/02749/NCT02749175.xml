  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cricoid force is applied during airway management to prevent pulmonary aspiration of
      regurgitated gastric contents. This force is usually applied by a nurse or anaesthesia
      assistant. Currently this is performed WITHOUT monitoring and the force applied is
      determined by the individual's &quot;educated hand&quot; that is derived from his/her experience from
      past training and practice. Studies have shown that the actual force applied by nurse and
      anaesthesia assistant is inconsistent and deviates from the optimal force. Under application
      of cricoid force results in ineffective cricoid pressure and the risk of pulmonary
      aspiration. Consequences of pulmonary aspiration include lung injury and infection, hypoxia,
      long Intensive Care Unit stay and even death. Over exertion of cricoid force results in
      distortion of the larynx (leading to difficult bag mask, difficult tracheal tube insertion
      and hypoxia). Preliminary results from previous study (IRB 2014/437/D), an observation
      crossover pilot was carried out comparing the amount of cricoid force applied by 16 nurses
      on manikin with and without direct feedback. Nurses were instructed to apply a range of
      force of 30-44 Newtons on a marked site on the neck region of manikin. A flexiforce load
      sensor was used. Unblinded nurses performed significantly better with feedback using the
      load sensor then blinded nurses. With Funding from a National grant, a real-time measurement
      of cricoid force is developed to give feedback and guide the operator to exert and maintain
      the TARGET cricoid pressure during rapid sequence induction (RSI).

      In this study we aim to verify the sensor system with a manikin and compare the forces
      applied by nurses with the sensor system and without.
