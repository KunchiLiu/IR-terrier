      A Phase 1b/2 Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of HBI-8000 in Combination with
      Nivolumab in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors Including Melanoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma
      (RCC) and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

      The Primary objective of this study will be:

      • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of HBI-8000 when combined with a standard dose and
      regimen of nivolumab, to determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2
      Dose (RP2D) and to evaluate frequency and severity of toxicities of this combination
      treatment

      Secondary objectives will include:

        -  To explore the efficacy of study treatment as measured by Objective Response Rate
           (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Duration of Response
           (DoR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in all patients treated at RP2D

        -  To obtain pharmacokinetics of twice weekly HBI-8000 when administered in combination
           with nivolumab administered once every two weeks

        -  To characterize the effect of HBI-8000 on the electrocardiogram QT interval corrected
           (QTc) interval.

      Dose Escalation Phase (1b) will include up to 18 patients, followed by Cohort Expansion
      Phase (2) including up to 20 patients per tumor indication at MTD and/or RP2D.

           Phase (2) including up to 20 patients per tumor indication at MTD and/or RP2D.

      HBI-8000 tablets will be administered at 20, 30, 40 mg/dose, orally twice a week until MTD
      or 40 mg in Phase 2, if MTD is not reached.

      Nivolumab will be administered at a standard dose 3 mg/kg intravenous infusions every 2
      weeks.

      A treatment cycle consists of 28 days.

      Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.
