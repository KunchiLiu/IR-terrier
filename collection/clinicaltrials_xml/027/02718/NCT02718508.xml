      The objective of this trial is to test feasibility and acceptability of an e-parenting
      skills intervention with parents of injured adolescent alcohol users (12-17 years old) as
      compared to standard care at three pediatric trauma centers. To examine these questions, the
      investigators will randomly assign adolescent and parent dyads (n=75) to one of two groups.
      One group will continue to receive the institutional standard care of a brief alcohol
      intervention delivered by clinical staff to the adolescent with no parenting skills
      intervention. The second group will continue to receive the same institutional standard care
      plus the parent will receive an e-parenting skills intervention consisting of: the online
      parent training program, Parenting Wisely(PW), plus text messaging and a web-based message
      board. Study participants will be injured adolescents, 12-17 years old, admitted to the
      inpatient service of the trauma center, and with a positive CRAFFT (mnemonic acronym of
      first letters of key words in the screening tool) screen for alcohol use. Adolescents'
      alcohol use will be measured at study enrollment and at 3 and 6 months after discharge.
      Adolescents' alcohol related negative consequences will be measured at study enrollment for
      the 6 months prior to hospitalization and again at 6 months after hospital discharge.
      Parenting skills will also be assessed at 3 and 6 months.

    <textblock>
      This study seeks to test the feasibility and acceptability of an e-parenting skills
      intervention at three pediatric trauma centers. The investigators will randomize 75 dyads of
      injured adolescents (12-17 years old) who screen positive for alcohol use and their parent
      to receive either standard trauma center care (a brief intervention with the adolescent) or
      standard trauma center care (a brief intervention with the adolescent) plus an e-parenting
      skills intervention consisting of a computerized intervention for parent skill building, a
      series of text messages and a web-based message board. The primary aim of this study is to
      determine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting the e-parenting intervention
      protocol across three pediatric trauma centers in preparation for a larger fully power
      trial. The central hypothesis for our future fully powered randomized control trial is that
      adolescents whose parents receive the e-parenting skills intervention will decrease their
      alcohol use and alcohol-related negative consequences over the 6 months following the
      intervention more than adolescents who receive only standard trauma center care. Therefore,
      a secondary aim of this proposal is to calculate a preliminary effect size that could be
      used, along with other relevant data, such as the acceptability data and findings in the
      literature, to calculate sample size in a future fully powered randomized control trial. The
      investigators will also examine adolescent's conjoint use of marijuana. This project
      advances translational research in collecting preliminary data on an e-parenting skills
      intervention that can be easily adopted with high fidelity across pediatric trauma centers.
      Its findings have the potential to directly impact best clinical practices for intervening
      with alcohol using injured adolescents
