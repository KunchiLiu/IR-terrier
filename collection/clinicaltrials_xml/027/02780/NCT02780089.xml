    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the different patterns of care for patients who have unresectable or
      metastatic melanoma. The dosing, duration, regimen, indication, and treatments will be
      observed. The survival rate of these patients will also be observed.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a non-interventional, observational study with the primary objective to assess and
      describe &quot;real world&quot; patterns of care in the treatment of patients with unresectable or
      metastatic melanoma. A sample size of 1,600 prospective patients will provide sufficient
      information to explore this primary objective. There will be no forced number of patients
      enrolled into a specific treatment cohort. Setting or controlling specific treatment
      enrollment cohort counts would invalidate the results of the primary objective of the study.
      No primary hypothesis is being tested.

    <description>To assess the selection and sequencing of drugs and practice patterns used to treat unresectable and metastatic melanoma (e.g. immune checkpoint agents, targeted agents, or combination therapies) in a real-world setting. Reasons for initial treatment decisions across and between drug classes, changes in treatment, and discontinuation will be recorded (e.g. lack of benefit, safety, cost, or other barriers to care).</description>

    <description>There will be 1,600 prospective patients recruited over a period of two years and followed-up for a planned minimum of three years. For the prospective cohort, patients will be recruited after the course of treatment has been decided by the physician and prior to the start of treatment.Prior advanced melanoma treatment information will be collected from patient charts for pre-treated patients. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 3 years from their study index date until death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up/record, or end of study, whichever comes first. Study index date will be the date when first study therapy is initiated.</description>
