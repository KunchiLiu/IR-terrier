  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to investigate the efficacy in terms of 6 month progression free
      survival (PFS6) and objective response rate (ORR) of afatinib, in patients with
      advanced/metastatic urothelial tract carcinoma who have progressed despite prior platinum
      based chemotherapy.

      Other measures of efficacy include progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),
      disease control rate (DCR), duration of objective response (DOR), and tumour shrinkage.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Recurrent or metastatic urothelial cancer

          -  Patients must have failed prior platinum based treatment (adjuvant or 1st line)

          -  Archival tissue sample available for biomarker testing at pre-screening and tissue
             banking.

          -  Patients should complete a pre-screening biomarker analysis and should fulfill the
             following: for Cohort A tumour should show a ERBB2 (epidermal growth factor family
             receptor 2) or ERBB3 mutation, or ERBB2 gene amplification; for Cohort B tumour
             should show EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) amplification.

          -  Further inclusion criteria apply

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Prior use of EGFR, ERBB2 or ERBB3 targeted treatment

          -  Chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment. Biological therapy
             or investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment or
             prior to passing 5 half-lives, i.e. systemic clearance, whatever comes first

          -  Known brain metastases or signs hereof, uncontrolled spinal cord compression or
             leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
