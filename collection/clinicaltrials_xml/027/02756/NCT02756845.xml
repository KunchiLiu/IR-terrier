      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of talimogene laherparepvec in pediatric
      subjects with advanced non-CNS tumors that are amenable to direct injection in the clinical
      setting. Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection to
      approximately 18 to 36 pediatric subjects with advanced non-CNS tumors. Pediatric subjects
      will be enrolled into cohorts stratified by age and baseline herpes simplex virus type-1
      (HSV-1) serostatus (3 to 6 subjects/cohort). DLT will be evaluated based on 3 to 6
      DLT-evaluable subjects in each cohort The DLT evaluation period is 35 days from the initial
      administration of talimogene laherparepvec.

    <description>The first dose of talimogene laherparepvec will be administered at a dose of up to 4.0 mL of 10ᶺ6 PFU/mL followed by a dose of up to 4.0 mL of 10ᶺ8 PFU/mL 21 days (+3 days) later. Subsequent doses of up to 4.0 mL of 10ᶺ8 PFU/mL will be administered every 14 days (± 3 days) thereafter. Cohorts will be assigned as follows:
Cohort A1 (age 12 to &lt; 18 years; HSV-1 seropositive)
Cohort A2 (age 12 to &lt; 18 years; HSV-1 seronegative)
Cohort B1 (age 2 to &lt; 12 years; HSV-1 seropositive)
Cohort B2 (age 2 to &lt; 12 years; HSV-1 seronegative)
Cohort C1 (age 0 to &lt; 2 years; HSV-1 seropositive)
Cohort C2 (age 0 to &lt; 2 years; HSV-1 seronegative Once Cohort A1 is determined safe based on DLT rules, cohorts A2, B1, C1 can be opened simultaneously for enrollment. Cohorts B2 and C2 may be opened once cohort A2 is determined safe.</description>

    <description>Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection only into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, nodal tumors, and other non-visceral tumors with or without image ultrasound guidance. The first dose of talimogene laherparepvec will be up to 4.0 mL of 10^6 PFU/mL administered on day 1. The second injection, up to 4.0 mL of 10^8 PFU/mL (or up to 4.0 mL of 10^6 PFU/mL for a dose de-escalated cohort), will be administered 21 (+3) days after the initial injection. All subsequent injections, up to 4.0 mL of 10^8 PFU/mL (or up to 4.0 mL of 10^6 PFU/mL for a dose de-escalated cohort), will be administered every 14 (± 3) days. The treatment cycle interval may be increased due to toxicity.</description>
