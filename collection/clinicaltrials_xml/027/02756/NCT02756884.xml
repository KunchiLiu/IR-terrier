  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, prospective, randomized, controlled study in patients
      with non- revascularizable moderate or severe lower extremity Peripheral Arterial Disease
      (PAD) receiving autologous stem cells therapy (minimally manipulated). This study will
      enroll a maximum of 10 subjects in this study. The patients will be divided into two groups.
      One group will receive Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) alone and the other group will
      receive low frequency ultrasound before the addition of ADSCs. The randomization will be
      1:1. If the results of this pilot study are not clearly different, there will be a need for
      a phase II study to support the results.

      Baseline, 6 week, 3 month and 6 month assessments of 6 min walking distance (6MWT), Ankle
      Brachial Indexes (ABIs)/Toe Brachial Indexes (TBIs), Transcutaneous Partial Oxygenation
      (TcPO2) and Rutherford assessments will be performed for the study group. Prior to the stem
      cell treatment, the ultrasound group patient will receive noninvasive transcutaneous pulsed
      focused ultrasound around the involved vessel(s) in the affected extremity. All patients
      will then receive 200 million autologous stromal vascular fraction cells containing adipose
      derived stem cell therapy: 1/3 of the cells will be delivered intra-venous proximal to the
      lesion (not retrograde), 1/3 of the cells will be delivered intra- adventitia proximal to
      the lesion and 1/3 of the cells will be delivered by intra- muscular injection along the
      vessel path (20-30 injections each separated by1.5 inch). Standard therapy for PAD patients
      will not be interrupted for the duration of the study. Standard therapy for PAD is defined
      as cardiovascular general measures like lifestyle changes, smoke cessation, exercise,
      cardiovascular rehabilitation, etc. All participants have already received maximal
      non-surgical therapy. Safety will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
