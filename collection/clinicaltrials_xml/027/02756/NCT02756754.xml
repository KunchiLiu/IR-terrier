  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the novel use of adrenal radiofrequency ablation on a
      prospective cohort of patients with primary aldosteronism and unilateral adrenal adenoma
      concerning the efficacy on blood pressure control. The safety of the procedure is one of the
      secondary outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of hypertension dramatically increased. Although most cases of hypertension
      are idiopathic, some cases have an identifiable cause. Primary Aldosteronism (PA) is the
      most common cause of secondary hypertension and can be cured by surgery if PA is due to
      unilateral unique adrenal adenoma. Then this cause is worth identifying it. The surgery
      despite its minimally invasive nature is limited by the need for general anesthesia, the
      risk of vascular or visceral injuries, hematomas and all the adrenal gland is mostly
      removed. Imaged-guided percutaneous adrenal radiofrequency ablation (ARF) offers a less
      invasive alternative therapeutic option. This local therapy is employed to treat solid
      neoplasms whereas its application on functional adrenal adenoma is less documented and only
      a few case series with limited sample size are published. The impact on blood pressure
      control is not clearly reported. ARF ablation works by delivering a high-frequency
      alternating current through a needle electrode. An ionic agitation occurs and generates
      frictional heat for cell destruction at a predictable temperature and volume. Patients with
      a conventional documented PA due to unilateral adrenal nod who consented to the study were
      hospitalized. Patients with PA due to an aldosterone-producing adenoma are included in the
      study.

    <description>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique for eliminating both primary tumors and metastases.
The needles that will be used are monopolar RFA, the LeVeen™ Needle Electrode Family with a generator &quot;RF 3000&quot; by Boston Scientific. The radiofrequency system will be used as the RFA generator device standard cycle of ablation will be applied in the patient. During RFA, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen saturation will be continuously monitored.</description>
