      The purpose of this study is to observe clinical response to treatment with alogliptin
      benzoate (Vipidia) utilization patterns in standard clinical practice.

    <textblock>
      The drug being studied in this study is called alogliptin benzoate. Alogliptin benzoate is
      being researched to treat people who have diabetes mellitus type 2. This study will look at
      the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level dynamics in participants with diabetes mellitus
      type 2.

      The study will enroll approximately 1403 patients. Alogliptin benzoate will be prescribed by
      their physician in accordance with the Russian summary of product characteristics (SmPC).

      This multi-center study will be conducted in the Russian Federation. The overall duration of
      study for observation will be approximately 6 months. Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic as assigned by each physician according to their routine practice, in every 3
      months.
