  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility-the inability to conceive despite one year of properly timed unprotected
      intercourse-is a common problem. Of all types of male factor infertility, non-obstructive
      azoospermia may be the most difficult for couples. Importantly, patients with
      non-obstructive azoospermia are asked to make difficult decisions in terms of reproductive
      choice; surgical attempts at identifying sperm (microdissection testicular sperm extraction)
      are often offered to these patients without a guarantee of being able to identify sperm. New
      methodologies in terms of evaluation of azoospermic males PRIOR to the couple embarking upon
      IVF are needed urgently. The other potential benefit of non-invasive determination of testis
      function and spermatogenesis would be the potential targeting of sperm extraction
      procedures. We hypothesize that quantitative MRI employing advanced functional metrics will
      be sensitive to functional and metabolic differences between subsets of azoospermic cases
      and will improve upon current characterization of patients with this condition. Moreover, it
      is believed that these techniques will provide complementary information, such that they may
      be combined in a synergistic fashion for targeted extraction methodologies.

    <textblock>
      Of all types of male factor infertility, non-obstructive azoospermia may be the most
      difficult for couples. Azoospermia (both obstructive and non-obstructive) occurs in
      approximately 10-20% of all infertile males with non-obstructive azoospermia encompassing
      the majority of cases.

      In this study, quantitative MRI will be investigated by employing advanced functional
      metrics for addressing these challenges. Specifically, diffusion-weighted imaging will be
      assessed, multi-echo T2 mapping, arterial-spin labeling, and spectroscopy. No intravenous
      contrast will be administered for purposes of this study. It is hypothesized that these
      techniques will be sensitive to functional and metabolic differences between subsets of
      azoospermic cases and will improve upon current characterization of patients with this
      condition. Moreover, it is believed that these techniques will provide complementary
      information, such that they may be combined in a synergistic fashion for targeted extraction
      methodologies.

      The goal of this exploratory study is to investigate whether associations exist between
      quantitative MRI metrics and the previously noted features of testis architecture.

    <description>Imaging will be performed using a clinical whole-body MRI and a pelvic phased-array coil. No intravenous contrast will be administered. Sequences will include Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), T2 mapping, arterial spin labeling, and spectroscopy. The acquisition is expected to take approximately one hour</description>
