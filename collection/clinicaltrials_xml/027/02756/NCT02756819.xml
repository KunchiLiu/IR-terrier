      The purpose of this study is to estimate antihypertensive effect of azilsartan medoxomil
      (Edarbi®) therapy on blood pressure in participants with overweight or obesity in routine
      clinical practice of hypertension (HTN) treatment in the Russian Federation and in the
      Republic of Kazakhstan..

      The drug being tested in this study is called azilsartan medoxomil. Azilsartan medoxomil is
      being tested to treat people who have hypertension. This study will look at the clinic
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) in obese participants who will be
      prescribed with azilsartan medoxomil by physician.

      The study will enroll approximately 1916 patients. All participants will be asked to take
      azilsartan medoxomil as prescribed by their physician according to local SmPC.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the Russian Federation and the Republic of
      Kazakhstan. The overall duration of study for observation will be approximately 6 months.
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic as assigned by each physician according
      to their routine practice, in every 3 months.
