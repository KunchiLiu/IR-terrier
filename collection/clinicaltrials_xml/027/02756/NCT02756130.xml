    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a Phase II, single center, open label, proof-of-concept study
      evaluating the efficacy of birinapant in combination with platinum based chemotherapy. This
      pilot study is aimed at determining the efficacy of carboplatin and birinapant co-therapy in
      treating patients with advanced newly diagnosed or recurrent high grade serous carcinomas.
      Only bio-assay positive patients will be enrolled

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be eligible for study participation if they meet all of the following
        inclusion criteria, after participant has provided written informed consent.

          1. The participant is female ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. All patients must have measurable disease by imaging defined as tumor that can be
             measured ≥ 10 mm with multiparametric MRI (primary modality of imaging) or CT (as an
             alternative) or ≥ 10 mm by caliper on physical examination.

          3. Participant is capable of understanding and complying with parameters as outlined in
             the protocol and able to sign and date the informed consent, approved by an
             Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB), prior to
             initiation of any screening or study-specific procedures.

          4. The participant must have a histologic diagnosis of advanced, newly diagnosed or
             recurrent high grade serous cancer (ovarian, tubal, peritoneal, endometrial), to be
             treated with chemotherapy.

          5. Participants must either undergo surgery that would yield fresh tumor or have an
             image guided biopsy performed to yield fresh tissue for the in vitro organoid
             bio-assay and two biomarker testing (western blot and immunohistochemistry).

          6. Only patients with tumors that score positive in the in vitro organoid bio-assay will
             be enrolled in the clinical trial. Patients with tumors that score negative in this
             bio-assay will be considered screening failures and will not be enrolled in the
             clinical trial.

          7. Participant must have either no neuropathy (sensory and motor) or neuropathy less
             than or equal to Grade 1.

          8. The participant must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score between
             0 - 2 at screening.

          9. The Participant must have a life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

         10. Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/ mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL or equivalent

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), unless known
                  Gilbert's Syndrome has been diagnosed

               -  AST (aspartate aminotransferase) (SGOT)/ALT (alanine aminotransferase) (SGPT) ≤
                  2.5 × institutional ULN (≤ 5 × ULN if liver metastasis)

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2

               -  Amylase and Lipase &lt; ULN

         11. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test at screening and negative (serum or urine) pregnancy test within 72 hours before
             the first study-drug dose. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as
             negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. The serum pregnancy test must be
             negative for the Participant to be eligible.

         12. Female participants of childbearing potential should ensure use of a highly effective
             method of birth control as defined by the Investigator, for example, those which
             result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and
             correctly such as implants, injectable, combined oral contraceptives, some
             intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner during the
             study and for a period of at least 4 months following the last dose of any drug
             administered during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A participant will be excluded from the study for any one or more of the following
        reasons:

          1. Patients with tumors that score negative in the in vitro organoid bio-assay will be
             excluded.

          2. Patients with non-measurable disease &lt; 10 mm on multiparametric MRI or CT scan will
             be excluded.

          3. Participants undergoing primary de-bulking surgery prior to receiving neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy are excluded.

          4. Participants with a secondary malignancy that is progressing or requires active
             treatment. Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially
             curative treatment are not excluded.

          5. Participants who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to birinapant or its constituents.

          6. Participants requiring the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies,
             such as infliximab, or has received treatment with anti-TNF therapies within 5
             half-lives of the drug.

          7. Participants with an uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited
             to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, hypertension, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, autoimmune disease or inflammatory diseases, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          8. Pregnant women or women who expect to conceive a child are excluded from this study
             because birinapant is an agent with unknown potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects in humans. Because there is an unknown risk for adverse events
             (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with birinapant,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.

          9. Participants who have a known active infection requiring systemic therapy, including
             HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.

         10. Participants with a history of cranial nerve palsy.

         11. Participant is or has an immediate family member (e.g., spouse, parent/legal
             guardian, sibling or child) who is an investigational site or sponsor staff directly
             involved with this trial, unless prospective IRB approval (by chair or designee) is
             granted allowing exception to this criterion for a specific subject.

         12. In the opinion of the Investigator, the participant is an unsuitable candidate for
             this study.

         13. Patients who are taking or anticipate taking any maintenance therapy while actively
             being treated on protocol or while being followed on protocol will be excluded. An
             example of this would be maintenance therapy with a poly ADP (adenosine diphosphate)
             ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor such as Olaparib.
