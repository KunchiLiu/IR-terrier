  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and depressive disorders are common in children and adolescents, however they are
      often unrecognized. Rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), a form of cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) is efficient for children and adolescents. School settings are
      appropriate environments to deliver such interventions for vulnerable youths. Given youth's
      access and predilection to use technology, a technology-enhanced prevention program was
      developed. The present study aims to investigate the efficacy of a transdiagnosticREBT
      prevention program for internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents, implemented in a
      school setting.

      Classes from different Romanian public schools will be randomized in either intervention or
      wait list group. The prevention program will be group-based, delivered in 6 sessions, over 3
      weeks. Participants would be assessed baseline and post-intervention. Each of the six
      modules aimed a different component: Psychoeducation, Relaxation and Breathing, Relationship
      between cognitive distortions/irrational beliefs and emotions, Cognitive restructuring,
      Exposure, Maintenance of gaining. Despite specific activities, for each session a cartoon on
      that subject will be viewed and discussed. Homework would be given at every session.

      REBT/CBT prevention programs delivered in school settings represent ecological modalities to
      target vulnerable groups. Technology components added to traditional programs may lead to
      greater motivation and satisfaction with treatment.
