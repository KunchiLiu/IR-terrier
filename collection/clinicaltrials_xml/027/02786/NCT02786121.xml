    <textblock>
      Several authors explain as the kinesiophobia plays an important role for the recovery after
      orthopaedic surgery. The aim of the investigators study is to investigate if the
      kinesiophobia is able to influence the early recovery after total hip arthroplasty. The
      early recovery will be measured by the ILOA Score. The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia will
      measure the fear level of movement. All the other variable that could influence the ILOA
      Score are identified and collected: age, sex, body max index, ability of patient
      pre-surgery, type of anesthesia, length of stay, pain, haemoglobin, possible complications.

    <measure>Iowa Level of Assistance (ILOA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome considered was the level of autonomy achieved by the patients at the 5th days after surgery, measured by the Iowa Level of Assistance (ILOA) scale that took into account the patient's autonomy in carrying out functional 5 activities: supine-to-sitting, sitting-to-standing, walking, climbing 3 steps, and gait speed. The total score ranged from 0 to 50, where 0 was the patient's complete autonomy and 50 the maximum dependence. The score was based on the level of help that was supplied to the patient by the operator for the safe execution of activities, with a range between 0 and 30, and the type of assistive device used with a range between 0 and 20. The physiotherapist will collect the ILOA Score.</description>
