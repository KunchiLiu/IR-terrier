  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV multi-center, randomized, open-label, cross-over, placebo study in
      subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to compare inhaler-specific
      preference attributes of two inhalers - ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI) and the HANDIHALER
      DPI. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether more subjects with COPD
      prefer the ELLIPTA inhaler to the HANDIHALER DPI based on the number of steps needed to take
      medication.

      All subjects will use the ELLIPTA inhaler and the HANDIHALER inhaler in the corresponding
      treatment periods based on the randomisation scheme, and at the end of 2 periods, complete
      the inhaler preference questionnaire. Subjects will self-administer the inhalation once
      daily for 5-9 days in each treatment period.

      This study will be placebo-only, and neither inhaler will contain active treatment. Subjects
      will continue their current COPD medication(s) as prescribed, and will follow up with their
      regular physician for their COPD healthcare during the study.

      Approximately 211 subjects will be enrolled in the study.

               1. Acute worsening of COPD that is managed by the subject with corticosteroids or
                  antibiotics or that requires treatment prescribed by a physician, in the 4 weeks

                  abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that,
                  in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
                  through participation, or which would affect the analysis if the
                  disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

               3. Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, poor
                  motivation or other conditions that will limit the validity of informed consent

          -  Drug/Food Allergy: A history of hypersensitivity to any components of the study
             inhaler (for example, lactose, magnesium stearate). In addition, subjects with a
             history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the study physician,
             contraindicates participation will also be excluded.

          -  Investigational Product: Subjects who have received an investigational drug and/or
             medical device within 30 days of entry into this study (Screening/Visit 1), or within
             five drug half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer.

          -  Affiliation with Investigator's Site: A subject will not be eligible for this study
