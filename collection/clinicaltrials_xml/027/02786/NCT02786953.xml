    <textblock>
      Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are at increased risk for problems with adherence and
      suboptimal glycemic control, and novel approaches are needed to improve outcomes in this
      high-risk population. The majority of adolescents obtain insufficient sleep (defined as &lt;8
      hours/night), and sleep disturbance has been significantly associated with poorer adherence
      and predicted greater problems with quality of life and worse glycemic control. Yet, no
      interventions have addressed sleep in youth with T1D. Working from a biopsychosocial and
      contextual model of sleep, the investigators propose to tailor a sleep-promoting
      intervention to meet the needs of adolescents with T1D by conducting interviews with to
      identify the barriers and facilitators to adequate sleep specific to this population. The
      sleep-promoting intervention will be developed and tested, building on successful sleep
      interventions in other populations, including components such as limiting caffeine,
      establishing a media curfew, and positive bedtime routines, while addressing the needs
      unique to adolescents with T1D, such as fear of hypoglycemia. The study will be conducted by
      a multidisciplinary team, consisting of Sarah Jaser, PhD, a pediatric psychologist, and two
      co-investigators, Beth Malow, MD, MS, a neurologist with specialty in sleep medicine, and
      Jill Simmons, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist. Sleep is a potentially modifiable risk factor
      that may have both a physiological and behavioral impact on diabetes outcomes. Given the
      strong associations between sleep and diabetes outcomes in the preliminary data, and recent
      evidence from sleep restriction studies indicating the impact of insufficient sleep on
      insulin sensitivity, behavior, and mood, there is reason to believe that a sleep-promoting
      intervention has the potential to improve outcomes in adolescents with T1D indirectly by
      improving adherence and directly through its effect on metabolic function. Therefore, the
      proposed study offers a novel approach to improve adherence, quality of life, and glycemic
      control in adolescents with T1D.

    <description>Sleep quality will be measured with actigraphy data (efficiency) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index total score. A composite variable will be created from these two measures to indicate sleep quality.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1C data will be collected at 3 months and 6 months to examine change from basline. HbA1c is a measure of average blood glucose levels, and it is obtained quarterly in patients with type 1 diabetes during outpatient clinic visits as part of regular care. HbA1c &lt; 7.5% is recommended for adolescents with type 1 diabetes by the American Diabetes Association.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (PedsQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL, Type 1 Diabetes module, a self-report measure of quality of life will be used. Scaled scores range from 0-100, and higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Adherence (Self Care Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The parent and self-report versions of the Self Care Inventory will be used to measure adherence to the diabetes treatment regimen. Mean scores are calculated, ranging from 1-5, with higher scores indicating better adherence.</description>
