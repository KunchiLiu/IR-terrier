      This is a prospective, multi-center study of patients treated in accordance with the cleared
      indications for the Penumbra SMART CoilTM System (Smart), Penumbra Coil 400TM (PC 400), and
      Penumbra Occlusion DeviceTM (POD). Data for each patient are collected in accordance with
      the standard of care at each participating hospital through one-year follow-up.
      Approximately 1,000 patients with intracranial aneurysms or other malformations treated by
      the SMART CoilTM System at up to 100 centers will be enrolled. It is anticipated patient
      enrollment will take 3 years. All patients are to be assessed in accordance with the
      standard of care at each participating hospital through one year follow-up.

    <description>Coil technology has evolved considerably since the initial introduction of the GDC coil over 25 years ago. In recent history, coil development has mostly focused on the delivery system, or pusher technology, and detachment. The new Penumbra SMART Coil not only addresses improvements in the delivery system, but importantly incorporates new technology into the actual coil implant itself. Penumbra SMART technology enables an individual coil to become progressively softer as it is deployed, utilizes advanced materials to improve stretch resistance, and incorporates new processes to create accurate complex and helical shapes.</description>

    <description>Current coils available to physicians have three principal levels of softness, Standard, Soft and Extra Soft. A conventional coil currently has only one level of softness, derived from using smaller platinum filaments than a Standard coil to make Soft and Extra Soft coils. The level of softness of the Penumbra SMART Coil is determined not only by the diameter of the platinum filament, but also by a proprietary structural element inside the coil. This unique development enables the Penumbra SMART Coil to become progressively softer along the length of a single individual coil as it is being deployed.</description>
