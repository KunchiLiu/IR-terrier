  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TP-0903 is a novel oral inhibitor that targets AXL kinase. Preclinical studies have shown
      promising antitumor activity of TP-0903 as a single agent against a variety of tumor types
      in both in vitro and in vivo studies.

      This first-in-human study is conducted to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of TP-0903 administered orally to patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      The study will investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary
      anti-tumor activity profiles.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetics,
      and pharmacodynamic study of TP-0903 administered once daily for the first 21 out of 28
      days.

      There are 2 stages in this study. In Stage 1, sequential cohorts of three (3) patients will
      be treated with escalated doses until the MTD is established. In the absence of
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose will be increased using a modified Fibonacci dose
      escalation scheme. Once the MTD has been established, up to 10 additional patients may be
      enrolled at the MTD dose level for confirmation of safety (Stage 2).

      Patients who successfully complete a 4-week treatment cycle without evidence of significant
      treatment-related toxicity or progressive disease will be permitted to continue to receive
      treatment with the same dose and dosing schedule.
