      A longitudinal clinical study to investigate the changes before and after administration of
      tolvaptan in patients whose clinical course is monitored prior to the approval of tolvaptan
      will employ a method different from that used in the TEMPO study.

      In response to the results of the Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of Autosomal
      Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Its Outcomes (TEMPO 3:4), the use of tolvaptan has
      been approved in Japan since March 2014 to treat autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
      disease (ADPKD). In March 2015, tolvaptan was approved by the Canadian Government, European
      Medicines Agency (EMA) and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).
      Additionally, approval in European countries is anticipated.

      Kyorin University Hospital started administering tolvaptan to patients in May 2014. As the
      dosing conditions in the clinical setting are different from those in the TEMPO study, this
      will enable the investigation of factors that were not addressed in the TEMPO study. A
      longitudinal clinical study to investigate the changes before and after administration of
      tolvaptan in patients whose clinical course is monitored prior to the approval of tolvaptan
      will employ a method different from that used in the TEMPO study. The proposed clinical
      study should ideally be conducted jointly by multiple centers. However, since April 2014,
      only a few hospitals have employed the volumetric method using magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) to measure total kidney volume (TKV). Also, very few hospitals adopted the volumetric
      method to measure TKV prior to approval. Consequently, this study is to be performed solely
      by Kyorin University.

      This is a prospective comparative study &quot;to investigate the therapeutic effect before and
      after administering tolvaptan to patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;
      based on the &quot;Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects&quot;
      promulgated on December 22, 2014 by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
      Technology and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The study includes ADPKD patients
      who participated in the preceding studies conducted by Kyorin University School of Medicine
      Urology Department, ADPKD Research Section, and the Radiology Department (prospective,
      retrospective studies).
