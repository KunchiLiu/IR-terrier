    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study with two
      2-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week wash-out period. Subjects will participate in
      up to eight study visits and have a follow up phone call approximately a week after the last
      clinic visit. Visits 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are evening visits that will be conducted between 5PM
      and 11PM. Visit 4 and Visit 7 are also evening visits that will begin between 5PM and 11PM
      and continue over a period of approximately 24 hours. Subjects will be required to attend
      three clinic visits during this 24-hour period. An exercise challenge (using a treadmill)
      will be conducted at Visit 2, Visit 3 and Visit 6 (after 23 hours of the first treatment
      dose in each Treatment Period); and at 12 and 23 hours post evening dose at Visits 4 and 7.
      Spirometry will be conducted at specified visits and prior to and after each exercise
      challenge.

      Subjects with symptomatic allergic rhinitis at Visit 1 (screening) may be treated for up to
      four weeks with intranasal corticosteroids followed by a repeat screening visit to determine
      eligibility prior to entry into the study.

      Eligible subjects at visit 1 will complete a 4-week single blind run-in on FP 250 microgram
      (mcg) twice daily (BID), followed by 2-week double-blind Treatment Period 1 on randomized
      treatment, a 2-week single blind washout period on FP 250 mcg BID, 2-week double-blind
      Treatment Period 2 receiving the alternative treatment, and follow-up contact approximately
      7-days after completing Treatment Period 2. The total duration of study participation is
      approximately 11 weeks; and up to 15 weeks for subjects with Symptomatic Allergic Rhinitis.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the protective effect of fluticasone
      furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) 100/25 mcg once-daily compared with fluticasone propionate (FP)
      250 mcg twice-daily against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adolescent and adult
      subjects aged 12 to 50 with persistent asthma.

          -  Symptomatic Allergic Rhinitis: Subjects with symptomatic allergic rhinitis at Visit 1
             may be treated for up to four weeks with intranasal corticosteroids followed by a
             repeat screening visit to determine eligibility prior to entry into the study.
             Subjects that continue to be symptomatic after up to four weeks of treatment will be
             excluded.

          -  12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG): A subject is not eligible if he/she has an abnormal,
             clinically significant ECG as determined by the investigator at the Screening Visit.

             of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved
             within 4 weeks of Visit 1 and led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion
             of the investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the
             subject's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Concurrent Respiratory Disease: A subject must not have current evidence of:

             1. Atelectasis 2. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia 3. Chronic bronchitis 4. Chronic

             significant, uncontrolled condition, or disease state that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation
             or would confound the interpretation of the efficacy results if the condition/disease
             exacerbated during the study.

          -  Investigational Medications: A subject must not have used any investigational drug

             guardian has any infirmity, disability, disease, or geographical location which seems
             likely (in the opinion of the investigator) to impair compliance with any aspect of
             this study protocol.

          -  Tobacco/Marijuana Use: Current tobacco smoker or has a smoking history of &gt;=10
             pack-years (20 cigarettes/day for 10 years). A subject may not have used inhaled
