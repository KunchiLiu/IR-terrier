  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to gather information on the effectiveness and
      tolerability of a novel composition of existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      approved topical medications for the treatment of moderate to severe melasma.

    <textblock>
      Subjects with moderate to severe melasma will apply 0.5 grams (pea-sized) amount of
      Illuminate Cream topically to affected areas for 20 weeks. The change in Melasma Area and
      Severity Index (MASI) score will be evaluated a baseline and Weeks 4, 12, and 20.

      The MASI score is a validated test, calculated by subjective assessment of 3 factors: Area
      (A) of involvement, Darkness (D), and Homogeneity (H), with the forehead, right malar
      region, left malar region, and chin, corresponding to 30%, 30%, 30% and 10% of the total
      face, respectively. The area of involvement in each of these 4 areas is given a numeric
      value of 0 to 6 (0 = no involvement; 1 = &lt;10%; 2 = 10%-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 =
      70-89%; and 6 = 90-100%).

      Darkness and homogeneity are rated on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 = absent; 1 = slight; 2 = mild;
      3 = marked; and 4 = maximum). The score is calculated by adding the sum of the severity
      ratings for darkness and homogeneity, multiplied by the value of the area of involvement,
      for each of the 4 facial areas.
