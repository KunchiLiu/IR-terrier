      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the additive intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering
      effect of Brinzolamide 1%/Brimonidine 0.2% (SIMBRINZA®) dosed twice daily (BID) when added
      to Travoprost 0.004%/Timolol 0.5% (DUOTRAV®) in subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension.

      This study is divided into 2 sequential phases for a total of 5 visits. Phase I of the study
      is the open-labeled Screening/Eligibility Phase, which includes a Screening Visit followed
      by 2 Eligibility Visits. Phase II of the study is the randomized, double-masked Treatment
      Phase, which includes 2 on-therapy visits: Visit 4 (at Week 2) and Visit 5 (Week 6, Exit
      Visit).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma (including pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion
             glaucoma) or ocular hypertension.

          -  Currently on treatment with Travoprost 0.004%/Timolol 0.5% prescribed as approved in
             the country, on evening dosing for at least 28 days prior to screening, and in the
             opinion of the Investigator may benefit from further IOP lowering.

          -  Mean IOP measurements at both the Eligibility 1 and Eligibility 2 visits, in at least
             1 eye (the same eye(s) ≥ 21 and ≤ 28 mmHg at 9:00 while on a Travoprost 0.004%/
             Timolol 0.5% solution.

          -  Able to understand and sign an informed consent form that has been approved by an
             Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee.

          -  Willing and able to attend all study visits.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential: not postmenopausal for at least 1 year or less than
             6 weeks since sterilization, currently pregnant; have a positive result on the urine
             pregnancy test at Screening; intend to become pregnant during the study period;
             breast-feeding; or not in agreement to use adequate birth control methods to prevent
             pregnancy throughout the study.

          -  Any form of glaucoma other than open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

          -  Severe central visual field loss in either eye.

          -  Chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease in either eye.

          -  Ocular trauma in either eye within the past 6 months prior to the Screening visit.

          -  Ocular infection or ocular inflammation in either eye within the past 3 months prior
             to the Screening visit.

          -  Retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment in either eye.

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity score worse than 55 ETDRS letters (equivalent to
             approximately 20/80 Snellen, 0.60 logMAR or 0.25 decimal) in either eye.

          -  Other ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) in either eye that may, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, preclude the safe administration of any study
             medication.

          -  Intraocular surgery in either eye within the past 6 months prior to the Screening
             visit.

          -  Ocular laser surgery in either eye within the past 3 months prior to the Screening
             visit.

          -  Any other condition including severe illness which would make the subject, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study.

          -  Asthma, history of asthma, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
