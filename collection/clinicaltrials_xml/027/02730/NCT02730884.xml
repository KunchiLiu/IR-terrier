  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if rigosertib can help to control MF in
      patients with anemia. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take rigosertib
      capsules by mouth 2 times each day (1 morning dose, 1 afternoon dose) for 48 weeks. You will
      take your morning dose on an empty stomach. Your afternoon dose should be taken at about
      3:00 pm (±1 hour), at least 2 hours after lunch. You will fast for at least 1 hour after
      each dose. You should drink at least a ½ gallon of water each day. Rigosertib should be
      refrigerated.

      You will also be given a study drug diary. You should write down each dose of study drug
      that you take, when you take it, and if you miss or vomit any doses. If you miss or vomit a
      dose of rigosertib, you should not make up the dose. You should take the next scheduled dose
      as planned. Every 3 weeks for 12 weeks, then every 6 weeks thereafter, you should bring any
      leftover rigosertib capsules and your study drug diary with you to the clinic.

      Study Visits:

      You will need to fast before each blood draw you have while on study. The doctor will tell
      you for how long you need to fast.

      On Cycle 1 Day 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing about 1 hour
           after your dose of study drug. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body
           at different time points.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about your quality of life. It should take about
           10-15 minutes.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
           resonance imaging (MRI) scan to check the status of the disease.

      Each week, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the study doctor
      approves it, you may have these weekly blood draws at a local lab closer to your home. The
      results from these routine tests will be sent to the study doctor.

      On Day 1 of Week 4, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing before
      and 1 hour after your dose of study drug.

      At Weeks 24 and 48 (± 1 week):

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy performed to check the status of the
           disease. This sample may also be used for cytogenetic testing.

        -  If you had a CT/MRI scan performed during Week 1, you will have another CT/MRI scan to
           check the status of the disease.

        -  If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      Every 4 weeks until Week 12 and then every 8 weeks after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about your quality of life.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 48 weeks. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may be able to continue taking the
      study drug after 48 weeks. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 4 weeks after your last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit. At
      this visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will
           need to fast before this blood draw. The study doctor will tell you for how long you
           need to fast. This routine blood and urine collection will also include a pregnancy
           test if you can become pregnant.

      This is an investigational study. Rigosertib is not FDA-approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 35 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
