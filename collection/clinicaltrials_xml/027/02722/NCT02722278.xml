      A Phase 3, Randomized, Active-controlled, Open-label Study of the Safety and Efficacy of
      Oral Testosterone Undecanoate (TU) in Hypogonadal Men

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-comparator group, efficacy
      (based on Cavg of T), and safety study in adult hypogonadal male subjects. Enrollment is
      based on criteria designed to select the general population of hypogonadal men. Study drug
      doses will be titrated using a dose-titration algorithm based on total T Cavg. Subjects may
      be androgen treatment-naïve or washed out of prior androgen replacement therapies.

      Subjects must have 2 total T levels &lt; 300 ng/dL based on 2 blood samples obtained in the
      morning (AM) on 2 separate days approximately 7 days apart.

      Approximately 180 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive open-label treatment in a
      3:1 ratio of oral TU to Axiron (ie, approximately 135 subjects will be randomly assigned to
      oral TU and approximately 45 subjects will be randomly assigned to Axiron topical solution).
      Subjects who complete the study will receive 105 days of treatment. Serial pharmacokinetics
      (PK) samples over 24 hours will be obtained after 21, 56 and 105 days of treatment. Dose
      titrations will be based on the T Cavg on day 21 and 56 of treatment.

      A subset of 30 subjects will participate in a cosyntropin stimulation test. Subjects will
      receive an injection of cosyntropin on Day 1 (before administration of study drug) and Day
      106 after the last 24-hour PK sample has been drawn. Cortisol assay will be collected
      immediately before the injection, as well as 30 and 60 minutes after the injection.
