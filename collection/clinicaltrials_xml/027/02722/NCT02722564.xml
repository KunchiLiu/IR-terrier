  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective survey study. The participants will all be volunteers of legal
      drinking age. Each participant will consume one alcoholic beverage (beer) at a time and then
      will be asked to verbally estimate their current blood alcohol concentration and if the
      subject feels they are able to drive. At that time, their BAC level will be measured
      objectively using a breath alcohol test (BAT) device. The participant will not be told their
      objective value. This will continue with a verbal estimate and actual BAT reading after
      every drink until the participant reaches a minimum BAC of 0.10. At this time, participants
      will continue to be monitored until their BAC falls to 0.08 and they are clinically sober.
      As their blood alcohol level decreases, the investigators will ask the participant to
      estimate their level every hour along with an actual reading until reaching 0.08.
      Statistical analyses will be used to determine how accurate self estimation is in regards to
      blood alcohol content.
