          9. Female participants must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and on admission
             to the clinic, and must not be lactating and must be using an acceptable method of
             contraception throughout the study and for 3 months after the last dose, or be of
             non-childbearing potential. Non-pregnant female partners of male participants who are
             of childbearing potential should use an effective form of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior use of systemic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy.

          2. Prior use of rituximab

             have been discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to Baseline. No other conventional
             DMARDs are permitted and no combination therapy is permitted.

          5. Prior use of cytotoxic or alkylating agents or immunosuppressants must have been
             discontinued for at least 90 days prior to Baseline

          6. Current use of oral corticosteroids at a dose &gt;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent or
             change of dose within 2 weeks prior to Screening
