  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the helpfulness of the integrated call center in optimizing use of
      the Digital Medicine System in adult subjects with Schizophrenia, Major Depressive Disorder,
      or Bipolar Disorder taking oral aripiprazole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Digital Medicine System includes a drug-device combination of aripiprazole + an
      ingestible event marker (IEM), a wearable sensor (skin patch), and application software to
      convey the level of activity and rest, and to mark events through the act of ingestion.

      Physician and self-report are the most commonly used to assess medication compliance yet
      studies have consistently found that healthcare providers' subjective judgments of
      medication compliance are often inaccurate, with a tendency for practitioners to
      overestimate subject adherence. The sponsor's intent is to develop a system that will
      benefit future subjects by providing the ability to measure their medication-taking behavior
      in an objective manner and being able to monitor several physiologic parameters.

    <description>Subjects will receive an intervention consisting of a drug-device combination that consists of an aripiprazole tablet with a tiny sensor embedded within it referred to as an Ingestible Event Marker (IEM) . They will discontinue their normally prescribed oral aripiprazole tablets and will take the aripiprazole(2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30 mg) + IEM once daily for the 8-week assessment period for this trial.</description>
