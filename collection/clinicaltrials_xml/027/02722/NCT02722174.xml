  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine a battery of behavioral and questionnaire measures in 4 disorders
      clinically associated with impulsivity and in health controls, to: 1) investigate if the
      different populations have a distinct behavioral profile, and 2) to investigate if there are
      specific measures that are reliable and sensitive measures of impulsivity across diagnoses.
