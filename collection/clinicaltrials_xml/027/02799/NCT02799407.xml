    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the modular, multi-tiered consent process featured
      in Apple's ResearchKit (RK) to the standard consent process. The primary objective is to
      determine whether participants using the ResearchKit consent form have a significantly
      higher comprehension of the elements of consent than participants using the standard consent
      form.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the modular, multi-tiered consent process featured
      in Apple's ResearchKit (RK) to the standard consent process. The primary objective is to
      determine whether participants using the ResearchKit consent form have a significantly
      higher comprehension of the elements of consent than participants using the standard consent
      form. Through this two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) 120 participants will be asked
      to read through either a ResearchKit multi-tiered consent form administered on an iPod Touch
      device or a standard long-form consent form administered via paper and give their informed
      consent for a sham research study on health tracking apps. The participants will then be
      asked to answer a short series of questions (5 minutes) about the consent process in order
      to measure their subjective and objective comprehension. The main risk from this study is
      loss of confidentiality of responses, however this risk should be minimal given that
      protected health information (PHI) will only be collected on the consent document and all
      information will be stored on Duke Box in a private folder only accessible by the study
      team.
