  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) have difficulty using their hands
      and arms. MyndMove is a non-invasive medical device that uses short, low energy electrical
      pulses with surface electrodes to cause muscle contractions to produce a full range of
      reaching and grasping movements, which the patient is unable to perform by him/herself.

      By using MyndMove therapy to help the individual move their arms and hands as he/she
      attempts to carry out typical reaching and grasping movements, the individual improves their
      ability to perform these tasks voluntarily.

      The purpose of this study is to study the effectiveness of MyndMove therapy in improving the
      ability of individuals to move their arms and hands.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Traumatic incomplete (AIS B-D) C4-C7 SCI

          2. Early treatment group = 10 days to 6 months (182 days) post tSCI (note it is expected
             that most ppts will be recruited from this group, while at GF Strong)

          3. Late treatment group = initiate treatment on or after 6 months plus one day (183
             days+) post tSCI

          4. SCIM self-care sub-score â‰¤ 10

          5. Able to understand and follow instructions

          6. Able to be in a seated position for a least one hour of upper limb therapy

          7. Able to attend the study treatment sessions

          8. Able to provide informed consent

          9. Men and women of the age of majority in their province or state

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous history of any other neurological disorder or conditions that may affect
             motor response

          2. Upper extremity injury or condition prior to SCI that limits the function of the hand
             or arm

          3. Malignant skin lesion on the affected upper extremity

          4. History of seizure disorder not effectively managed by seizure medications

          5. An existing electrical stimulation devices (e.g. ICD, Pacemaker, Spinal Stimulation)

          6. Rash or open wound at any potential electrode site

          7. Denervation of muscles that are targeted by MyndMove

          8. Poorly controlled autonomic dysreflexia (as determined by the local site physician)

          9. In the judgment of the local site physician, participant has medical complications
             that may interfere with the execution of the study

         10. Botulinum toxin injection into affected upper extremity within 3 months prior to the
             study start. No botulinum toxin injections during the study treatment and follow up
             period.

         11. Currently enrolled in another upper limb study

         12. Enrolled, in the past six months, in a clinical study involving drugs or biologics
