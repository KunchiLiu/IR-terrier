    <textblock>
      Amblyopia is a significant health problem, affecting up to 4% of the population in the
      United States. Amblyopia, commonly known as &quot;lazy eye,&quot; is a developmental visual disorder
      in which one or both eyes suffer from poor vision as a result of being disadvantaged in
      early life. Strabismus, or eye misalignment, such as crossed eyes (esotropia) or wandering
      eyes (exotropia), and anisometropia, or a power difference between the eyes, are the most
      common causes of amblyopia. If conventional treatment, such as patching the better seeing
      eye, is not initiated during the critical period of visual development, lasting visual
      impairment may persist throughout life. This critical period of visual development has been
      thought to end around age 10. However, recent research has demonstrated that the critical
      period of visual development can be extended into adulthood. Complete light deprivation in
      animal models has restored plasticity in the visual cortex and has demonstrated drastic
      recovery of vision in amblyopic eyes. The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the
      impact of complete light deprivation on visual function in a cohort of human adults with
      severe amblyopia from anisometropia.
