  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Tumor Associated
      Peptide Antigen (TAPA) pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccines in the treatment of hematologic
      malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies (as defined) who have responded to
      conventional therapy, and without any potentially curative therapeutic intervention, will be
      candidates for this Phase I/II study. Following confirmation of disease response to
      conventional antineoplastic therapy, eligible patients who agree to participate and sign a
      consent form will have their tumor cells and/or blood analyzed for the expression of a
      specific panel of Tumor Associated Peptide Antigens (TAPAs), including SP17, Ropporin,
      AKAP4, PTTG1 and Span-xb. Patients whose tumors express one (1) or more of these TAPAs will
      receive three (3) days of subcutaneous Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor
      (GM-CSF) to increase bone marrow production of monocytes and dendritic cell (DC) precursors,
      and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be obtained by phlebotomy and/or leukapheresis
      for generation of autologous DCs. Patient's DCs will be generated at Kiromic's Cell
      Processing Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) facility, according to established Standard
      Operating Procedures, and activated by pulsing/loading them with the TAPA(s) relevant for
      each particular patient. Patients will receive five (5) days of low-dose cyclophosphamide
      prior to each vaccination with TAPA-pulsed DCs to decrease Treg activity. TAPA-pulsed DCs
      will be administered at a fixed dose of up to 1 x 107 DCs at least two (2) days following
      cyclophosphamide administration. DC vaccination schedule will be once every fourteen (14)
      days via subcutaneous (SC) and intradermal (ID) injections for a total of 6 vaccinations.
      Low dose GM-CSF will also be administered SC for five (5) consecutive days, starting three
      (3) to six (6) hours after each TAPA-pulsed DC treatment, to optimize immune response and DC
      viability in vivo. Patients will be followed on a weekly basis (or more frequently if
      required) to evaluate treatment-related toxicity. Immune responses and anti-tumor responses
      will be evaluated per protocol specifications. Continuation and stopping rules for the study
      will be defined based on toxicity/tolerability (Phase I) and/or immune responses (Phase II).
