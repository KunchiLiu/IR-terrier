  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a study which is being conducted in healthy volunteers in order to evaluate
      the comparative reduction of Propionibacterium acnes in-vivo following once daily topical
      administration of BPX-01 Minocycline 1% Topical Gel (BPX-01) or BPX-01 Vehicle control.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative reduction of Propionibacterium
      acnes (P. acnes) in-vivo following once daily topical administration of BPX-01 Minocycline
      1% Topical Gel or BPX-01 Vehicle control Gel.

      A secondary objective is to assess the tolerance of the treatment regimen versus a vehicle
      control. Safety laboratory data (chemistry and hematology) and plasma levels of minocycline
      are also of significant interest to the sponsor.

      This is a single center, randomized, double blind, two-cell, vehicle controlled P. acnes
      study. All subjects will be randomized 2:1 to 1% BPX-01 or vehicle control to be applied as
      a topical gel once daily for four (4) weeks.

      This is a six (6) week study with a four (4) week treatment period and a two (2) week post
      treatment follow up visit. The clinical endpoint is in-vivo quantification of P.acnes. The
      safety/tolerance endpoints are; observer reported: erythema, scaling-peeling, edema, and
      subject reported: tightness, burning-stinging, and itching. Plasma levels of minocycline and
      basic hematology and chemistry laboratory values will be collected.

          3. Show a high degree of fluorescence of the face under a Wood's lamp at the screening
             visit.

          4. Be willing to refrain from using antimicrobial topical products for the duration of
             study participation;

          5. Be willing to return to the study center for all study visits;

          8. Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator or his designee,
             could interfere with the subject's ability to use the treatment as instructed, alter
             their treatment response, or affect their ability to complete the study
