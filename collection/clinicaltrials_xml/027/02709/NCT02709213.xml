  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aetiologies of computed tomography-diagnosed acute colitis remain surprisingly unknown.
      Moreover, no diagnostic tool or clinical score allow to quickly determine or at least
      stratify the exact cause of colitis in patients admitted at an Emergency Ward and to direct
      them to the appropriate therapeutic care. The aims of the present study are to describe the
      presentation and aetiologies of acute colitis, and to develop diagnostic methods to guide
      patients admitted for acute colitis to the appropriate therapeutic care, particularly
      colonoscopy.

    <measure>Determination of the aetiologies of colitis using microbiological examination of the stools +/- colonoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>&lt;24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of the aetiologies of colitis and classification into one of the following categories (in %): infectious colitis (bacterial, parasitic or viral), chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, other), ischemic colitis and iatrogenic colitis (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other). In first intention, the routine microbiological examination of the stools usually performed (PCR assay looking for Shigella spp., Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.; PCR for Clostridium difficile as well as cultures for Vibrio spp. and Yersinia spp. (in option)) will be completed with a high-sensitivity multi-array PCR assay (FilmArray). If the routine microbiological examination of the stools yields to the absence of a potential pathogen, a colonoscopy will be performed to look for: 1) a tumour, 2) a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, or 3) an ischaemic colitis. Patients in whom no aetiology can be found will be given a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of anamnestic, clinical and biological predicting factors for patients requiring diagnostic colonoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>&lt;24 hours and at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Variables related to patients presentation at admission will be detailed and collected, regarding anamnesis, clinical examination and para-clinical exams. Results of the investigations performed during hospitalization will be collected (microbiological examination of the stools, colonoscopy). Faecal calprotectin will be determined for all stool samples. The Geneva Tumour Registry will be searched for the occurrence of tumour at the site of colitis at 1 year after the initial diagnosis. Predictors of &quot;positive&quot; colonoscopy (inflammatory bowel disease, cancer) will be identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, analysing variables collected at admission and faecal calprotectin.</description>
