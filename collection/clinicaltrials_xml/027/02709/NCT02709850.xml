    <textblock>
      The purpose is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of
      IONIS ANGPTL3-LRx (ISIS 703802) given to healthy volunteer subjects with elevated
      triglycerides and subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia.

    <time_frame>Up to Day 127</time_frame>
    <description>The safety and tolerability of IONIS ANGPTL3-LRx will be assessed by determining the incidence, severity, and dose-relationship of adverse effects and changes in the laboratory parameters by dose. Safety results in subjects dosed with IONIS ANGPTL3-LRx will be compared with those from subjects dosed with placebo.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics after single and multiple doses of IONIS ANGPTL3-LRx.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 127</time_frame>
    <description>The plasma pharmacokinetics (concentration-time results) of IONIS ANGPTL3-LRx (unconjugated and conjugated ASO) will be assessed following single and multiple-dose SC administration. The amount of IONIS ANGPTL3-LRx excreted in urine at selected 24-hour intervals will also be determined.</description>
