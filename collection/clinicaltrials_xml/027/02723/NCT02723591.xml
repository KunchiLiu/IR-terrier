    <textblock>
      This study will compare the incidence of a two-part composite endpoint consisting of de novo
      donor specific antibody formation or a designation of &quot;immune activation &quot; on peripheral
      blood molecular profiling in patients maintained on twice daily, immediate-release
      tacrolimus versus those maintained on Astagraf XL in the first two years post-transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, two year, prospective, randomized, multi-center, open-label trial
      examining long-term kidney transplant outcomes through the use of an adaptive design and a
      two-part, composite surrogate endpoint. Specifically, it is designed to compare the effects
      of twice daily, immediate-release tacrolimus and once daily Astagraf XL on DSA formation and
      the development of IA in de novo kidney transplant recipients during the first two years
      following kidney transplantation. Patients will be screened prior to surgery and randomized
      1:1 to receive, within 48 hours of transplantation, immediate-release tacrolimus,
      administered twice daily, or Astagraf XL, as a component of a standard immunosuppression
      maintenance regimen also consisting of corticosteroids (if given per institutional protocol)
      and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (or Myfortic® equivalent).
