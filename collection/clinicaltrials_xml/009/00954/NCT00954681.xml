    <textblock>
      Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States. However, the
      treatment options for cannabis dependence are limited; notably, no effective pharmacotherapy
      has been developed. Conceptually, the ideal medication treatment for cannabis dependence
      would:

        1. be safe when administered to patients actively using cannabis

        2. reduce cannabis intake and promote abstinence

        3. treat the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal

        4. reduce craving and relapse risk

        5. have a low abuse liability.

      Conceptually, the pharmacodynamic and clinical actions of quetiapine suggest that it may be
      useful for cannabis dependence. By antagonizing dopamine, quetiapine may interfere with the
      reinforcing effects of cannabis, while serotonin type 2A, histamine type 1, and adrenergic
      receptor antagonism may reduce cannabis withdrawal symptoms, primarily by sedating and
      anxiolytic effects. The proposed research project is an open-label pilot study to evaluate
      the tolerability and ideal target dosing range for quetiapine treatment of cannabis
      dependence over an eight-week period. The purpose of this pilot study is to obtain
      preliminary data regarding the potential efficacy, tolerability and safety of quetiapine
      treatment of cannabis dependence before conducting a larger double-blind trial.
