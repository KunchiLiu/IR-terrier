  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if there is a benefit of adding Herceptin
      (trastuzumab) to standard chemotherapy in this type of breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant (primary) chemotherapy refers to chemotherapy given before surgery. Neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy has a number of potential advantages including increasing the chances for
      breast preservation at the time of surgery as well as it may improve the local control of
      the cancer. Several national breast cancer studies have shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      was equal to chemotherapy given following surgery.

      A standard treatment for stage II or Stage III invasive breast cancer with low HER2
      expression is combination chemotherapyAdriamycin, Cytoxan,followed by a Taxane: given either
      before or after surgery), followed by surgery +/- radiation therapy.

      The main purpose of chemotherapy however is to reduce the risk of recurrence of cancer and
      also make surgery more successful. HER2 is a receptor located on the surface of some cells.
      This receptor plays a role in regulating the growth of the cell, in addition to the growth
      of tumors. High levels of the HER2 receptor may predict those women who benefit from
      treatment with agents such as Herceptin that target HER2. Herceptin (Trastuzumab) is a drug
      that is effective both alone and in combination with standard chemotherapy. There is some
      data to suggest that patients whose tumors have low expression of the HER2 protein and are
      normal by FISH may also receive benefit from Herceptin.
