      The purpose of this research study is to see if a specific kind of MRI, called Ultrasmall
      Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Magnetic Resonance Imaging (USPIO MRI), which uses an
      FDA-approved therapeutic agent(Feraheme) to see if it is able to identify small and
      otherwise undetectable lymph node metastases in people who have pancreatic cancer and are
      scheduled for surgical resection.

      -  On the first day, study participants will undergo 2 MRI examinations. A scan will be
           done prior to administration of the contrast agent (Feraheme) and then a second scan
           immediately after administration. On the second day, study participants will be asked
           to return for a third MRI.

        -  All MRI scans will be done at Massachusetts General Hospital.
