    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized controlled trial of gene therapy intervention
      by subretinal administration of AAV2-hRPE65v2. At least twenty-four subjects, three years of
      age or older, will be recruited. The intervention group will receive AAV2-hRPE65v2 vector at
      either The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia or University of Iowa to determine if it
      improves visual and retinal function in individuals with LCA2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a disease where part of the eye (the retina) is severely
      diseased. Usually it is detected in affected people within the first few months of life, as
      there is significantly poor vision at birth. Cells in the retina are lost over time in
      people with LCA which leads to total blindness. There are no pharmacological treatments
      available. This study will focus on the form of LCA caused by changes (mutations) in DNA
      that makes a certain protein (called the 65 kDa retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-specific
      protein, or RPE65). Clinical diagnosis is made by function tests of the eye. This can be
      confirmed by a special method of testing (molecular testing) to verify that the RPE65 is not
      correct.

      This study uses a gene therapy vector made from an adeno-associated virus (AAV) called
      AAV2-hRPE65v2. Gene therapy refers to the incorporation of new DNA into cells with the goal
      of supplying a therapeutic gene or a gene that is missing or not functioning in the cell.
      The AAV parts of the gene therapy vector work as a delivery vehicle for getting the normal
      human RPE65 gene into the cells of the retina. An earlier clinical study of AAV2-hRPE65v2
      was conducted based on the demonstration of safety and effectiveness of the vector in
      animals with a similar eye disease. The earlier clinical study tested three doses of the
      vector in twelve children and adults. The three doses were safe for the eye and the rest of
      the body in individuals as young as eight years old. AAV2-hRPE65v2 administration also led
      to increased vision in the subjects, with the youngest subjects showing the most
      improvement.

      This study will deliver AAV2-hRPE65v2 vector to at least sixteen intervention group
      subjects, age three or older; subjects will receive the vector in both eyes via subretinal
      injections during surgeries (on separate days). The purpose of this research study is to
      assess the effectiveness and safety of the AAV2-hRPE65v2 gene therapy vector as a possible
      treatment for LCA2. The control group of at least eight subjects will be able to cross-over
      to the intervention group after one year, provided they still meet all eligibility criteria.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willingness to adhere to protocol and long-term follow-up as evidenced by written
             informed consent or parental permission and subject assent (where applicable).

          -  Diagnosis of LCA due to RPE65 mutations; molecular diagnosis is to be performed, or
             confirmed, by a CLIA-approved laboratory.

          -  Age three years old or older.

          -  Visual acuity worse than 20/60 (both eyes) and/or visual field less than 20 degrees
             in any meridian as measured by a III4e isopter or equivalent (both eyes).

          -  Sufficient viable retinal cells as determined by non-invasive means, such as optical
             coherence tomography (OCT) and/or ophthalmoscopy. Must have either: 1) an area of
             retina within the posterior pole of &gt;100 µm thickness shown on OCT; 2) ≥ 3 disc areas
             of retina without atrophy or pigmentary degeneration within the posterior pole; or 3)
             remaining visual field within 30 degrees of fixation as measured by a III4e isopter
             or equivalent.

          -  Subjects must be evaluable on mobility testing (the primary efficacy endpoint) to be
             eligible for the study. Evaluable is defined as: 1) The ability to perform mobility
             testing within the luminance range evaluated in the study. Individuals must receive
             an accuracy score of ≤ 1 during screening mobility testing at 400 lux or less to be
             eligible; individuals with an accuracy score of &gt; 1 on all screening mobility test
             runs at 400 lux, or those who refuse to perform mobility testing at screening, will
             be excluded. (See Appendix 3 for a description of accuracy score.); 2) The inability
             to pass mobility testing at 1 lux. Individuals must fail screening mobility testing
             at 1 lux to be eligible; individuals that pass one or more screening mobility test
             runs at 1 lux will be excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable or unwilling to meet requirements of the study, including receiving bilateral
             subretinal vector administrations.

          -  Any prior participation in a study in which a gene therapy vector was administered.

          -  Participation in a clinical study with an investigational drug in the past six
             months.

          -  Use of retinoid compounds or precursors that could potentially interact with the
             biochemical activity of the RPE65 enzyme; individuals who discontinue use of these
             compounds for 18 months may become eligible.

          -  Prior intraocular surgery within six months.

          -  Known sensitivity to medications planned for use in the peri-operative period.

          -  Pre-existing eye conditions or complicating systemic diseases that would preclude the
             planned surgery or interfere with the interpretation of study. Complicating systemic
             diseases would include those in which the disease itself, or the treatment for the
             disease, can alter ocular function. Examples are malignancies whose treatment could
             affect central nervous system function (for example: radiation treatment of the
             orbit; leukemia with CNS/optic nerve involvement). Subjects with diabetes or sickle
             cell disease would be excluded if they had any manifestation of advanced retinopathy
             (e.g., macular edema or proliferative changes). Also excluded would be subjects with
             immunodeficiency (acquired or congenital) as there could be susceptibility to
             opportunistic infection (such as CMV retinitis).

          -  Individuals of childbearing potential who are pregnant or unwilling to use effective
             contraception for four months following vector administration.

          -  Individuals incapable of performing mobility testing (the primary efficacy endpoint)
             for reason other than poor vision, including physical or attentional limitations.

          -  Any other condition that would not allow the potential subject to complete follow-up
             examinations during the course of the study or, in the opinion of the investigator,
             makes the potential subject unsuitable for the study.

          -  Subjects will not be excluded based on their gender, race, or ethnicity.
