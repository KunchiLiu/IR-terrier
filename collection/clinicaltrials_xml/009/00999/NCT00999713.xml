  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common, life-threatening complication among pediatric leukemia
      and lymphoma and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Although these
      children represent a relatively small and unique patient population, they account for the
      largest proportion of deaths of all pediatric diseases. The long-term goal of this project
      is to improve outcomes among these patients. Recently, the intratracheal administration of
      calfactant has resulted in decreased mortality among children with ALI including promising
      results among children with cancer and following HSCT. Consequently, the primary specific
      aim of this study is to assess the effect of calfactant on intensive care (PICU) survival
      among pediatric leukemia and lymphoma and HSCT patients with ALI. Secondary aims include
      assessment of the effect of calfactant on oxygenation and on the length of mechanical
      ventilation, PICU stay, and hospital stay. Calfactant therapy has been found to be of
      benefit in acute lung injury in the overall pediatric population by improving oxygenation
      and decreasing mortality. These findings, in conjunction with recent subgroup analysis in
      which calfactant therapy appeared to improve outcomes in immunocompromised children provide
      the rationale for assessing calfactant therapy in this patient population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must meet criteria for acute lung injury

               -  Intubated, mechanically ventilated, with respiratory failure secondary to
                  diffuse, bilateral parenchymal lung disease (as judged by chest x-ray).

               -  Oxygenation index (OI) &gt; 13, but &lt; 37, for two consecutive blood gases which
                  should be separated by at least one hour within 48 hours of the initiation of
                  mechanical ventilation.

               -  Arterial catheter placement

               -  Parental informed consent

          2. Patients must have a diagnosis of leukemia/lymphoma undergoing active treatment or
             following HSCT for any indication. Leukemia/lymphoma will be defined according to the
             National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Collaborative

             autologous.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of congestive heart failure and/or pulmonary capillary wedge
             pressure &gt;15 mmHg, or uncorrected congenital heart disease.

          2. Glasgow Coma Score &lt; 8 (prior to respiratory failure).

          3. Pre-existing limitations on care options, (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation Orders, etc).

          4. Patients with impending death from another disease.

          5. Patients moribund or with other organ failure at possible randomization:

               -  hypotension unresponsive to treatment (mean BP &lt; 60 or &lt; 5th % for age),

               -  persistent cardiac tachyarrhythmia &gt;150/minute, or persistent bradyarrythmia &lt;
                  50/minute, or age appropriate criteria for younger children,

               -  metabolic acidosis &gt; - 10 mEq/L for more than 2 hours,

               -  persistent arterial oxygen desaturation, PaO2 &lt; 50 or SaO2saturation &lt; 80%,

               -  hyperkalemia, serum K+ &gt; 6.5 plus widening of QRS complex on EKG
