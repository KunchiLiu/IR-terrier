  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric illness that affects up to 2-3%
      of the population. People with OCD experience anxiety-provoking, intrusive thoughts, known
      as obsessions, and feel compelled to perform repetitive behaviors, or compulsions. The only
      medications proven effective for OCD are serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), but even with
      SRI treatment, most patients continue to experience significant OCD symptoms, impaired
      functioning, and diminished quality of life. Recent evidence suggest that a different
      neurotransmitter, glutamate, may contribute to the symptoms in OCD. Medications that target
      glutamate hold promise for ameliorating symptoms for those patients continuing to suffer
      from OCD. In this study the investigators are recruiting patients to receive the drug
      memantine, which is thought to modulate the neurotransmitter glutamate, added to whatever
      other OCD medications they are taking in a 12-week open label study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          3. Physically healthy and females must be using effective contraception

          4. At lease moderate OCD symptoms (Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale [YBOCS]score
             greater or equal to 16 prior to entering trial)

          5. Able to provide consent

          6. May be on or off selective reuptake inhibitor (SRI) medications

               1. Patients on an SRI medication will be included if the dose is stable and
                  adequate (or if they don't want to increase their dose [e.g. side effects] and
                  have a history of prior SRI or CBT treatment meeting criteria for adequate
                  trial)

               2. Patients not on an SRI medication will be included if they they have failed at
                  least 1 prior trial of standard OCD treatment (e.g. SRIs or CBT)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ongoing treatment with memantine

          2. Patients planning to start CBT during the study period or those who have started CBT
             within 8 weeks prior to study enrollment

          3. Presence of psychotic symptoms or lifetime history of schizophrenia, bipolar
             disorder, or other psychotic disorder.

          4. Current major depressive disorder (patients must be free of the disorder for three
             months prior to enrollment). Patients will be excluded if they are moderately to
             severely depressed, but if they are mildly to moderately depressed they will be
             included (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale must be &lt;18).

          5. Judged clinically to be at risk of suicide (suicidal ideation, severe depression, or
             other factors).

          6. Current eating disorder

          7. Females who are pregnant or nursing

          8. Severe renal insufficiency, severe hepatic impairment, or seizure disorder.

          9. Documented history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to memantine.

         10. Concomitant use of trimethoprim, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor medications
