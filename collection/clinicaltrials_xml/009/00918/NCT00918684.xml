        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Psychotic depression by DSM-IV, i.e., presence of delusions with a score higher than

             cardiac, liver or kidney failure, major surgery, stroke or myocardial infarction
             during the three months prior to entry; or drugs known to cause depression, e.g.,
             reserpine, alpha-methyl-dopa, steroids.

          8. Failure to respond to an adequate trial of escitalopram (10 mg/day or more for 6
             weeks or longer) during the current or previous depressive episodes.

          9. Current involvement in psychotherapy.

         10. History of hypersensitivity to escitalopram or need to receive drugs that may
             interact with escitalopram.

         11. Inability to perform any of the ADLs (MAI: ADL subscale) even with assistance, e.g.
             walking with a cane is not an exclusion criterion.

         12. Inability to speak English.

         13. Aphasia.
