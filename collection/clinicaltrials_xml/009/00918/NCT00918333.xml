      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of panobinostat and everolimus
      when given together and to see how well they work in treating patients with multiple
      myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back. Panobinostat and
      everolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of LBH589 (panobinostat) and RAD001
      (everolimus) when used in combination in patients with myeloma or lymphoma. (Phase I) II. To
      evaluate the therapeutic activity of the combination of LBH589 with RAD001 in patients with
      relapsed or refractory lymphoma. (Arm A, phase II) III. To evaluate the therapeutic activity
      of the combination of LBH589 with RAD001 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma. (Arm B, phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicities associated with the combination of LBH589 with RAD001. (Phase
      I) II. To further describe the toxicities associated with the combination of LBH589 with
      RAD001 in each arm independently. (Phase II) III. To evaluate overall survival,
      progression-free survival, and duration of response in each arm independently. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction of LBH589 and RAD001. II. To assess the
      correlation between clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) effects with the
      pharmacologic (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) parameters, and/or biologic (correlative
      laboratory) results.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of panobinostat and everolimus followed by
      a phase II study. (dose-escalation closed to accrual as of April 6, 2011)

      Patients receive panobinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) or on days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, and 19
      and everolimus PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.

             treating physician's opinion, could adversely impact their ability to participate in
             the study; NOTE: patients on chronic oxygen therapy, those with liver disease such as
             cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis, or uncontrolled
             infections will be excluded

          -  Known hypersensitivity to RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycins (sirolimus,
             temsirolimus)

          -  Receiving any medications or substances that are strong or moderate inhibitors of
             CYP3A4; receiving any medications or substances that are inducers of CYP3A4

          -  Using medications that have a relative risk of prolonging the QT interval or inducing
             torsade de pointes if treatment cannot be discontinued or switched to a different
             medication prior to starting study drug

          -  Active bleeding tendency; NOTE: patients on therapeutic anticoagulation should be
             monitored carefully to maintain therapeutic level of anticoagulation to avoid
             increased risk of bleeding due to concurrent drug induced thrombocytopenia; it is
             suggested that patients who require anticoagulation therapy while on therapy use low
             molecular weight heparin (LMWH)

          -  Major surgery =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration or have not recovered from side
             effects of such therapy
