  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no clear standard of care for metastatic stomach or esophageal cancer in the United
      States. The purpose of this research study is to determine the differences between two
      regimens of chemotherapy; Arm A: PCA (Cisplatin, Irinotecan and Bevacizumab) and Arm B: TPCA
      (Docetaxel, Cisplatin, Irinotecan and Bevacizumab). Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and Irinotecan are
      traditional chemotherapy drugs. Bevacizumab is an antibody (a protein that attacks a foreign
      substance in the body). Bevacizumab is believed to stop the formation of new blood vessels
      that carry nutrients to tumors. Both of the chemotherapy regimens (PCA and TPCA) have been
      studied in patients with esophageal and gastric cancer, and we are trying to determine if
      one regimen will keep your cancer from growing and improve how long you can live.

      -  Because no one knows which of the study options is best, participants will be
           randomized into one of the two study groups: Arm A or Arm B.

        -  For both Arm A and Arm B, the chemotherapy will be given in an outpatient setting, once
           a week for two weeks in a row, with a rest period for the third week. This three week
           period of time is called a cycle.

        -  During week one Arm A (PCA) participants will receive bevacizumab, cisplatin, and
           irinotecan. Arm B (TPCA) participants will receive bevacizumab, docetaxel, cisplatin
           and irinotecan.

        -  During week two, participants will return to the clinic to receive chemotherapy (both
           arms will receive the chemotherapy agents and not bevacizumab). Blood tests and vital
           signs will also be collected.

        -  After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, participants will have CT scans done to see how their
           tumor is responding to the chemotherapy.
