  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial to see if treatment with
      sertraline as compared with placebo tablets will improve depression symptoms in patients
      with chronic kidney disease who have not yet started dialysis or received a kidney
      transplant. The investigators will also investigate whether sertraline treatment will
      improve quality of life and whether it is safe to use in patients with kidney disease. The
      study subject will be randomly assigned to take either sertraline or a placebo tablet for 12
      weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of adults with predialysis
      stages 3-5 Chronic Kidney Disease and Major Depressive Episode. Subjects will be randomized
      in a double-blind fashion to placebo or sertraline (beginning at 50 mg/d and escalated by 50
      mg increments every 2 weeks to a maximum of 200 mg/d) and followed for 12 weeks. The primary
      outcome is to investigate if treatment with sertraline, as compared with placebo, results in
      an improvement in depression symptom severity as measured by the Quick Inventory of
      Depressive Symptomatology Clinician Rated (QIDS-C-16) score. Secondary outcomes include
      whether sertraline, as compared with placebo, improves overall function and quality of life
      and whether it will result in more serious adverse events.
