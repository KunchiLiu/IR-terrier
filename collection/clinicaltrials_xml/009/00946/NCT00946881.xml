  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the optimal treatment conditions (WST11 dose and light
      energy dose) to achieve ablation in one lobe of the prostate and to evaluate the safety and
      quality of life of WST11 medicated Vascular-Targeted Photodynamic therapy (VTP) in men with
      localized prostate cancer.

      This study is designed as a multicenter, phase I/II, prospective, open-labeled, single
      intravenous (IV) dose, clinical trial in patients with localized prostate cancer.

      The study population will be men who have been offered curative therapy (radical
      prostatectomy; cryotherapy; brachytherapy; EBRT), and refused. Patients must have already
      had a previous biopsy showing a histologically proven carcinoma of the prostate. The
      identification and the location of the tumor will be done using both dynamic contrast MRI
      and biopsy.

      Only unilateral treatment with WST11-medicated VTP will be performed during the study.
      Treatment will consist of a single, 10 minute, IV administration of WST11 at doses of
      2mg/kg, 4 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg, followed by either light activation delivered through
      transperineal interstitial optical fibers for 20 minutes using 753 nm laser light at
      escalating fixed energy doses of 200 J/cm or 300 J/cm by escalating power at each energy to
      167 mW/cm or 250 mW/cm respectively. A brachytherapy-like template is used for the placement
      of the transparent implant catheters which are positioned in the prostate under transrectal
      ultrasound image guidance. The illumination fiber(s) are then inserted into the implant
      catheters.

      If the safety profile for a given WST11 and light dose is acceptable, additional patients
      (up to 3) may be treated with multiple fibers at that WST11 treatment dose.

      For cases where the Month 6 biopsy is positive, the patient will be offered the opportunity
      to be retreated with WST11
