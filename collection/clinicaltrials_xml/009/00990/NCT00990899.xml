    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in
      children with primary hypertension or pre hypertension. The secondary objectives are to
      determine any association factors for children with primary hypertension or prehypertension
      to have sleep disordered breathing be it gender, age, body mass index (BMI), family history
      (hx) or ethnic group.

      This is an exploratory, cross sectional study involving identification of the children of
      the age between 10 years and 17 years diagnosed with primary hypertension who have not been
      previously diagnosed and or treated for sleep disordered breathing with the revised
      pediatric sleep questionaire (PSQ) for sleep disordered breathing. The subjects that have
      shown interest will be mailed the informed consent/assent form to tbe reviewed. The
      consent/assent form will be handed to the child and all their questions and concerns will be
      answered in a comprehensible manner.
