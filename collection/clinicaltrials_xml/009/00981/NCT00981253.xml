      The purpose of this study is to assess the extent to which combining exercise and stress
      management training (SMT) is more effective at improving biomarkers in vulnerable cardiac
      patients compared to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and in
      roughly half the cases its first clinical manifestations, myocardial infarction (MI) or
      sudden cardiac death (SCD), are fatal. There is considerable evidence that &quot;stress&quot; plays a
      significant and independent role in the occurrence of CHD and its complications. This
      evidence has provided the rationale for developing interventional strategies to reduce
      stress in susceptible individuals in order to modify the natural history of these clinical
      events. There are now promising data to suggest that stress management training (SMT) is one
      such approach, and that SMT can have beneficial effects on psychosocial and medical
      outcomes. However, many of the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) employing stress management
      approaches in CHD patients have had important methodological limitations and several of the
      larger RCTs have failed to demonstrate a benefit for SMT over usual care, raising questions
      about the value of SMT for patients with CHD. Reliance on &quot;hard&quot; clinical endpoints is
      problematic because studies require such large sample sizes that they are logistically
      difficult to conduct and are prohibitively expensive. The use of intermediate
      pathophysiologic endpoints that have been shown independently to be associated with
      increased risk represents a novel and exciting opportunity to examine the added value of SMT
      in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) compared to CR without SMT on key biomarkers
      of risk in vulnerable CHD patients.

      This 12-week study will enroll adults with stable CHD who are eligible for CR. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to either standard cardiac rehabilitation or standard cardiac
      rehabilitation enhanced with weekly SMT. Prior to randomization, medical screening,
      standardized psychosocial questionnaires, mental stress testing, assessment of diet and
      physical activity, and exercise testing will be conducted. Additional biomarkers of risk
      will be assessed through measures of flow-mediated vasodilation, inflammation, platelet
      function, stress hormones, baroreflex, and heart rate variability.

      Participants assigned to CR alone will engage in supervised exercise routines 3 times per
      week. Participants will be encouraged to maintain consistent exercise duration and effort
      throughout each session. Participants assigned to CR enhanced with SMT will engage in
      standard exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and also receive weekly group SMT. At the
      conclusion of the 12-week intervention, participants will return for repeat assessments of
      stress and biomarker measures. At 6 months, 12 months, and annually up to 4 years
      participants will be contacted for information regarding major adverse cardiovascular
      events, other medical events and medication use.

      Additionally a group of age, gender, and disease matched cardiac patients referred to CR,
      during the same time interval, but who elected not to participate in CR will form a
      non-randomized comparison group for cardiac events.

      Overall, 164 participants were consented for study participation at Duke University Medical
      Center. Of these, 151 participants were randomized to either Standard Cardiac Rehabilitation
      or Enhanced Cardiac Rehabilitation. Post-intervention assessments were completed on 145
      participants.
