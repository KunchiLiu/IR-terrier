  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the immune memory through the administration of
      an additional dose of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A, the
      antibody persistence and long-term effect on nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H.
      influenzae in subjects primed and boosted with GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate
      vaccine GSK1024850A in previous primary and booster studies. For subjects that did not
      receive the investigational vaccine during the primary and booster study, the objective is
      to evaluate immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose catch-up vaccination with
      GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT00370318). The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase are presented
      in a separate protocol posting (NCT00496015).
