  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving study drugs before a meal may lower blood
      sugars after the meal. An improvement in blood sugar control may prevent long-term problems
      of diabetes.

    <textblock>
      A large study in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) showed that lowering blood sugars
      stopped or delayed the occurrence of health problems. As a result of the study, treatment
      should try to control blood sugars as near to normal as safely possible.

      In people without diabetes, the &quot;after meal&quot; blood sugar level is very carefully controlled
      by several hormones. Insulin (the hormone that lowers blood sugar) and glucagon (hormone
      that raises blood sugar) play a key role in keeping this careful balance. Also, we now know
      of 2 new substances made by the body called amylin and GLP-1 that also help with this
      careful balance. Amylin is made in the pancreas. GLP-1 is made in the gut. We know that both
      amylin and GLP-1 are abnormal in people with diabetes.

      There are two medicines that may help to control after meal blood sugars from going too
      high. The medicines are called Symlin (pramlintide) and Byetta (exenatide). Symlin works
      like amylin. Byetta works like GLP-1. Both medications are very similar in the ways that
      they work to control blood sugars.

      Both medicines help to keep glucagon lower after a meal. They both also help the stomach to
      digest food more slowly so the blood sugar does not go up too fast after eating. They also
      help to control how much hunger a person may have before meals. This may help a person to
      eat less and possibly lose weight. Byetta also seems to help islet cells (cells that make
      insulin) make more insulin.

      Byetta and Symlin are FDA approved for use in adults with T2DM. We want to study these drugs
      in children with T2DM.
