      To compare the outcome of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction performed using
      the tibialis allograft to historical outcomes of ACL reconstruction patients and to
      establish what, if any, correlation exists between the age of the graft donor and the
      clinical outcomes.

      This is a double-blind (the surgeon is also blinded), single-arm, single site, pilot study
      in subjects with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament. A total of fifty (N=50) subjects
      will be enrolled in this trial. One group of patients will receive a BioCleanse Tibialis
      graft recovered from donors 18-45 of age and the other group received grafts from donors
      over 46 years of age. Follow up is for two years.

      This is a single arm study in which all patients will receive a BioCleanse Tibialis
      allograft for ACL reconstruction. The age of the allograft donor constitutes the different
      groups.
