      A multi-center study conducted under a common implant and follow-up protocol. The study will
      collect pre-operative urologic testing, medical history and subject quality of life
      (Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire). Intra-operative procedural data will be
      collected.

      Pad weight and incontinence severity rating (using the ICIQ survey) will be used to
      characterize continence status.

      Post-operative complications, urologic testing, and subject quality of life will be
      collected at six weeks and three, six, 12, and 24 months.

    <intervention_name>The AMS Male Transobturator Sling System</intervention_name>
    <description>The AMS Male Transobturator Sling System was developed to treat urinary stress incontinence in men resulting from intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) secondary to radical prostatectomy. The Male Transobturator Sling System procedure is minimally invasive and consists of using two single-use needle passers and passing them through two small incisions over the obturator foramen. The needles are pushed in an arc through the tissue and exited at a perineal incision. Once the passers are through the perineal incision, the Sling System mesh arms are attached to the needles which are then pulled back through the needle track to their points of origin over the obturator foramen. The Sling System is subsequently tensioned and all incisions are closed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has agreed to be implanted with the AMS Male Transobturator Sling System.

          2. The subject is willing and able to give valid informed consent.

          3. The subject is &gt; 40 years of age.

          4. The subject has confirmed stress urinary incontinence for at least 6 months and uses
             no more than 8 pads per day for incontinence management.

          5. The subject has any of the following: an observable degree of incontinence during
             stress related activities, more than one pad is used in a 24 hour period, has more
             than two episodes of incontinence per day.

          6. Internal sphincter contractility confirmed by endoscopic view.

          7. The subject's primary etiology is TUR, TURP, radical prostatectomy, open
             prostatectomy, or suprapubic prostatectomy

          8. Pre-existing urological conditions, other than incontinence have been treated and are
             under control.

          9. The subject is willing and able to return for follow-up evaluations and questionnaire
             completion according to the study protocol.

         10. The subject is a good surgical candidate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has a neurogenic bladder condition that is not treatable or controllable
             by pharmacological or alternative methods.

          2. The subject has an atonic bladder.

          3. The subject has a post-void residual &gt; 75 cc.

          4. The subject has detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia.

          5. The subject has a urinary tract infection (UTI).

          6. The subject was treated with pelvic radiation within the last 6 months.

          7. The subject currently has an inflatable penile prosthesis.

          8. The subject self-catheterizes.

          9. The subject has symptomatic or unstable bladder neck stricture disease.

         10. The subject has a history of urethral strictures that may require repetitive
             instrumentation.

         11. The subject has previously had a urethral Sling System, an AMS Sphincter 800â„¢, or any
             implanted device for the treatment of urinary incontinence (not including bulking
             agents).

         12. The subject has a history of connective tissue or autoimmune conditions.

         13. The subject has a compromised immune system.

         14. The subject has renal insufficiency, and upper and/or lower urinary tract relative
             obstruction.

         15. The subject's reading level is judged inadequate for reading and understanding the
