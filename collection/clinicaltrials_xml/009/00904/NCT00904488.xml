  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, randomized, open-label study is to compare two diuretic
      strategies in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF): the addition of an
      oral thiazide diuretic to intravenous bolus (IVB) loop diuretic will be compared to
      transition from IVB to continuous infusion (CI) loop diuretic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized for ADHF secondary to fluid overload and who are experiencing an
      inadequate response to IVB furosemide and require additional diuresis will be enrolled.
      Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: the addition of oral metolazone to
      continued IVB furosemide versus transition from IVB to CI furosemide. A suggested algorithm
      for initial dosing and titration of these two diuretic strategies will be provided. Baseline
      and daily data collection will include various efficacy and safety endpoints including daily
      net urine output and weight, patient and physician global assessment scale, length of stay,
      30-day death or rehospitalization, vital signs, electrolytes, and renal function. Clinically
      meaningful efficacy and safety endpoints will be compared.
