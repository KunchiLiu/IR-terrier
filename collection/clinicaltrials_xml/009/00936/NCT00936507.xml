  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled study using a crossover design is to investigate
      the main effect of portion size and food type (low-energy dense vs. high-energy dense) on
      caloric intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to examine the impact of portion size on intake of a
      low energy dense food (fruit). Preschool-aged children will be provided with a small and
      large portion of applesauce (low-energy-dense food) and chocolate pudding
      (higher-energy-dense food) and allowed to eat the foods ad libitum during an afternoon snack
      in their usual preschool classroom. Measures of the amount of each food (grams and
      kilocalories) consumed will be taken.

      The following hypotheses are proposed:

        1. A significant main effect of portion size will occur, such that children will consume
           more food, both in grams and kilocalories, in the large portion as compared to the
           small portion conditions.

        2. A main effect of food type on caloric intake will occur, such that children will
           consume less calories in the applesauce condition as compared to the pudding condition,
           due to the differences in energy density of these foods. It is not anticipated that a
           difference in grams consumed from each food will occur.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All children that are â‰¥3 years of age enrolled in the ELC preschool with parental
             consent can participate.

          -  Eligible children must also like both the applesauce and the pudding, and be able to
             consume foods with a spoon.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children allergic to applesauce or chocolate pudding or who are lactose- intolerant
             will not be included in the study.

          -  Did not attend all feeding sessions.

          -  Did not consume more than 5 grams from any of the foods on an occasion.
