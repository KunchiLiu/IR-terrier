      This study is designed to see if the use of the drug Sitagliptin (used to reduce insulin
      resistance) will delay or prevent kidney transplant patients from getting diabetes.

      New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a complication of solid organ
      transplantation. In the UNMC Kidney-Pancreas Transplant Clinic, the frequency of this
      complication exceeds 50% of kidney transplant recipients without diabetes prior to
      transplantation. NODAT is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. As this
      complication appears to occur rather soon after transplantation, potential preventative
      strategies need to be instituted soon after transplantation. Although traditional risk
      factors, such as family history, obesity, and minority status, explain some of the
      additional risk, it is thought that the immunosuppressive agents themselves are responsible
      for the increased risk of NODAT. The immunosuppressive agents are needed to prevent
      rejection, and we are left to consider additional strategies to prevent the onset of NODAT.
      We propose to conduct a pilot study utilizing the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor,
      sitagliptin, in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in consecutive kidney
      transplant recipients at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. We have tested
      sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes who have received a kidney transplant and have
      shown no major side effects or alterations in immunosuppressive drug levels. This agent is
      FDA-approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but it has a low rate of hypoglycemia. It
      is thought to work by inhibiting the enzyme that naturally breaks down glucagons-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1), thus increasing endogenous levels of GLP-1. GLP-1 inhibits glucagons and
      has stimulatory effects on beta cell function. Although the current study will treat all
      non-diabetic patients in the hope that NODAT is delayed or prevented, this incretin-based
      therapy is thought to have a low risk for hypoglycemia and other side effects. In addition,
      it can be safely used during low-GFR conditions. The study will attempt to recruit 40
      subjects (20 sitagliptin and 20 control subjects). Patients will initiate placebo or control
      at 2 weeks after transplantation. Subjects will be followed in the UNMC Transplant Clinic.
      Initially, patients will be seen weekly and later will be followed every three months for up
      to 1 year. The primary outcome is the development of NODAT based on the 2003 Consensus
      International Guidelines. Fasting glucose levels will be followed according to usual
      post-transplant monitoring with testing as frequently as weekly during the recent
      post-transplant period and eventually going to at least monthly. Secondary outcomes include
      HbA1c values that will be obtained at baseline and then every three months. In addition, we
      will follow side effects, including hypoglycemia. The study will have a local DSMB. Consent
      will be obtained prior to transplantation.
