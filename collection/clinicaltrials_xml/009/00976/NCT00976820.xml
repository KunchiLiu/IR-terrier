        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female children 6 months to less than 9 years of age at the time of the first
             vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject's parent/ legally acceptable
             representative (LAR); written informed assent obtained from the subject if
             appropriate.

          -  Good general health as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Safety laboratory test results within the parameters specified in the protocol.

          -  Parent/ LAR access to a consistent means of telephone contact, land line or mobile,
             but NOT a pay phone or other multiple-user device.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/ LAR can and will comply
             with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential (pre-menarche) may be enrolled in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous vaccination with an H1N1v-like virus vaccine or a medical history of
             physician-confirmed infection with an H1N1v-like virus.

          -  Presence of evidence of substance abuse or of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses
             which, even if stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject
             or parent(s)/ LAR(s) unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports.

          -  Presence of a temperature &gt;= 38.0ºC (&gt;=100.4ºF) by any route or method, or acute
             symptoms greater than &quot;mild&quot; severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination.

          -  Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination

          -  Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month prior to study enrollment, or any
             other cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug within 6 months of study enrollment.
             Topical, intra-articular or inhaled glucocorticoids are allowed.

          -  Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months of study
             enrollment or planned administration of any of these products during the study
             period.

          -  Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or
             heparin. Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin are
             eligible if no such doses are given in the 24 hours before a study vaccination.
             Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., low-dose
             acetylsalicylic acid, and without a clinically-apparent bleeding tendency, are
             eligible.

          -  An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of Guillain-Barré syndrome within
             6 weeks of receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine.

          -  Administration of any licensed vaccine within 4 weeks before the first dose of study
             vaccine, with the exception of seasonal influenza vaccine.

          -  Planned administration of any vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol between Day
             0 and the Day 42 phlebotomy, including seasonal influenza vaccine. Routine childhood
             vaccinations are exempted if they cannot be delayed, but they must not be
             administered on the same day as the H1N1 vaccine candidate.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned
             use during the study period.

          -  Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines a history of
             anaphylactic-type reaction to any constituent of influenza vaccines; or a history of
             severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.

          -  Child in care.
