  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will be studying the effects of proton beam radiation
      therapy. This is a very accurate kind of treatment that has been shown to affect less normal
      tissue than a photon radiation beam. The accuracy allows the investigators to more safely
      increase the amount of radiation delivered to eliminate cancer. This accuracy will
      potentially reduce side effects that participants would normally experience using photon
      radiation therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine if radiation using proton beam
      therapy will kill the cancer cells in the participants liver.

      -  Participants will receive treatment as an outpatient in the Francis H. Burr Proton
           Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital, the MD Anderson Proton Therapy Center or
           the Roberts Proton Therapy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.

        -  Not everyone who participates in this study will be receiving the same dose of
           radiation. The dose received will be determined by the location of the tumor(s) within
           the liver.

        -  Proton Beam radiation therapy to the liver will be given once a day, 5 days a week
           (Monday-Friday), for 2 weeks.

        -  The following procedures will be performed once a week during treatment on days 1, 8
           and 15, as well as on the last day of radiation: physical examination and blood tests.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven unresectable or locally recurrent hepatocellular cancer or intrahepatic
             cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with a single lesion must be 12cm or less in greatest
             dimension. For patients with two lesions, no lesion may be greater than 10cm in
             greatest dimension. For patients with three lesions, no lesion may be greater than
             6cm in greatest dimension. Patients may have single or multinodular tumors (up to 3).
             There must be no evidence of extrahepatic tumor. Portal vein involvement or
             thrombosis is allowed.

          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as
             20mm or greater with conventional techniques or as 10mm or greater with spiral CT
             scan.

          -  Patients may have had prior chemotherapy, targeted biological therapy, surgery,
             transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation, or cryosurgery for
             their disease as long as it is greater than 4 weeks from first protocol radiation
             treatment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Patients may not have had prior
             radiation to the affected area.

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Expected survival must be greater than three months

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2

          -  Normal organ and marrow function as outlined in the protocol

          -  If patient has underlying cirrhosis, only Child-Pugh classification Group A or Group
             B patients should be included in this study.

          -  Patients must be either surgically sterile or post-menopausal. Male and female

             risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are
             eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ,

             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other study agents
