  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease is an inherited condition of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency resulting
      in lysosomal accumulation of glycogen in all tissues. Glycogen accumulation leads to muscle
      dysfunction and profound muscle weakness. A wide spectrum of disease is characteristic and
      the most severe patients have cardiorespiratory failure, often fatal in the first two years
      of life. Researchers have developed a way to introduce the normal GAA gene into muscle cells
      with the expectation that the GAA protein will be produced at levels sufficient to reduce
      glycogen accumulation. This study will evaluate the safety of the experimental gene transfer
      procedure in individuals with GAA deficiency. The study will also determine what dose may be
      required to achieve improvement in measures of respiratory function.

      The goal of the current study is to evaluate an experimental gene transfer procedure in
      which normal copies of the GAA gene are inserted into cells. In this study, a modified
      virus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), has been engineered to carry a normal copy of the GAA
      gene, known as rAAV1-CMV-hGAA, which is used to place normal copies of the GAA gene into
      diaphragm muscle cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of
      rAAV1-CMV-hGAA delivery into individuals with GAA deficiency (Pompe Disease).

      Participants currently using enzyme replacement therapy will continue to receive their
      regular medical regimen during the 12 month duration of the study. Participants will first
      attend a screening study visit to confirm study eligibility. Participants will then attend a
      3-5 day inpatient visit, during which they will receive a series of intradiaphragmatic
      injections consisting of the study agent (rAAV1-CMV-hGAA). Follow-up study visits will occur
      on Days 14, 90, 180, 270 and 365. Participants will have yearly follow-up evaluations by
      either telephone or mail for a total of 15 years, or as required by the FDA and other
      regulatory agencies.
