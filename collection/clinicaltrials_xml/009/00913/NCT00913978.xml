  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will participate in this study because they are undergoing scheduled abdominal
      surgery. The usual standard care participants receive in the operating room include
      maintaining normal temperature during planned surgical procedure. The anesthesiologist and
      staff will use warm blankets, warm air and warmed intravenous fluids (fluid given into the
      patient's IV). This study will evaluate the timing of applying warming devices and
      evaluating whether there is a difference between the timing and the patient's post operative
      recovery. Maintaining normothermia in this group of patients will lead to a decreased 30 day
      morbidity and mortality.

      Subjects will be randomized into two groups.

      The first group will have the warming devices started in the pre operative area. Subjects
      will receive warm blankets and a full body warm air blanket called the Bair Paws. This
      device is non experimental and is FDA approved and used within the hospital to keep patients
      warm. They will then have an intravenous catheter (IV is a small plastic flexible hollow
      tubing) placed by the pre operative care staff. Then they will receive warmed IV solution
      (salt water).They will then have their temperature taken and documented by the staff at
      various prescribed times.

      The second group will receive the warming devices and warmed IV fluids after they are in the
      operating room.

      Intraoperative period: The participants temperature will be monitored and documented at
      prescribed times.

      Postoperative period: The participants will have temperature monitored in the post
      anesthesia care area. Your part in this study will last until you are admitted to your room
      after surgery.
