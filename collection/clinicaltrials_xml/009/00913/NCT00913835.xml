    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with platinum-refractory or
      platinum-resistant advanced ovarian cancer have a better outcome when treated with IMC-3G3
      in combination with Liposomal Doxorubicin then when treated with Liposomal Doxorubicin
      alone.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in
      patients with platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant advanced ovarian cancer when treated
      with the monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 in combination with liposomal doxorubicin versus
      liposomal doxorubicin alone.

             resonance imaging [MRI]), as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors,
             Version 1.0 (RECIST v 1.0) guidelines. Tumors within a previously irradiated field
             will be designated as &quot;nontarget&quot; lesions unless progression is documented or a
             biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of
             radiation therapy

          -  The patient has recovered to Grade ≤ 1 by the National Cancer Institute Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) from the
             effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other
             targeted therapies for ovarian cancer, with the exception of alopecia or peripheral
             neuropathy (which must have resolved to Grade ≤ 2). The exceptions for such effects

             informed consent

          -  The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the
             upper limit of normal (ULN), and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine
             transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3 × the ULN (or ≤ 5 × the ULN in the presence of known liver
             metastases)

          -  The patient has adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × the
             institutional ULN. If creatinine is above the ULN, the patient's creatinine clearance
             is ≥ 60 mL/min

          -  The patient has urinary protein ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis; if urine
             dipstick or routine analysis is ≥ 2+, a 24-hour urine for protein must demonstrate &lt;
             1000 mg of protein to allow participation

          -  The patient must have adequate coagulation function as defined by International
             Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 5 seconds
             above ULN. Patients on anticoagulation must be on a stable dose of anticoagulant with
             a therapeutic INR and no active bleeding within 14 days prior to randomization, or on
             low molecular weight heparin AND have no pathological condition carrying a high risk
             of bleeding. Mild elevations of PTT of up to 1.5 × the ULN are acceptable, provided
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, they are related to ongoing use of
             coumarins (eg, warfarin)
