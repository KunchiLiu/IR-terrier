      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a single dose of an
      ibuprofen 600 mg extended release formulation in post-operative dental pain. There is
      concern that the manufacturing process may affect the performance characteristics of the
      selected prototype. Therefore, two formulations of this prototype manufactured by two
      different processes, [roller compaction] and [wet granulation] will be included in this
      study. The preferred prototype manufactured by two different methods will be compared to
      placebo and each other. This study will also characterize the
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship with these formulations.

             a partial or full bony mandibular impaction and have moderate to severe
             post-operative pain (confirmed by a VAS score of at least 50 mm on a 100 mm VAS)
             following surgical extraction;

          -  Use of only the following preoperative medication(s)/anesthetic(s): short-acting
             local anesthetic (mepivacaine or lidocaine) with or without vasoconstrictor, nitrous
