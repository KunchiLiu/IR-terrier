  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of plerixafor and bortezomib,
      and the highest dose that can be given to people safely. Plerixafor appears to stop myeloma
      cells from attaching to bone marrow and has been used in other phase I studies for
      mobilization of stem cells for patients with myeloma and lymphoma. We have shown that the
      combination of plerixafor and bortezomib is very effective in killing myeloma cells in the
      laboratory more than the effect of each drug alone.

      -  Since we are looking for the highest doses of the combined study drugs that can be
           administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that
           have multiple myeloma not everyone who participates will receive the same dose of the
           study drug. The dose the participant receives will depend on the number of participants
           who have been in the study before them and if they have tolerated their doses.

        -  Plerixafor will be given as an injection under the skin on days 1, 2, 4 and 5.
           Participants will receive plerixafor and bortezomib on days 3 and 6 and bortezomib
           alone on days 10 and 13. Bortezomib is administered intravenously. Each treatment cycle
           will last 21 days.

        -  The cycles will be repeated for up to 8 cycles as long as the participant does not have
           any severe or unmanageable side effects as the disease is responding to the study drug.

        -  While receiving study drugs and before the start of each study cycle, participants will
           come to the clinic and the following will be performed: physical exam, questions about
           current health and current medications, blood work, urine sample, x-rays (if deemed
           necessary) and EKG.
