  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of different
      formulations of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine 2189242A when administered alone or in
      combination with the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (GSK1024850A vaccine) as a
      2-dose primary vaccination course followed by a booster dose in healthy children aged 12-23
      months at the time of first vaccination. Considering that febrile reactions are frequently
      observed following pneumococcal vaccination, usually co-administered with other routine
      paediatric vaccines, the primary study objective will focus on evaluating the increase in
      grade 3 fever (i.e. rectal temperature &gt;40.0°C).
