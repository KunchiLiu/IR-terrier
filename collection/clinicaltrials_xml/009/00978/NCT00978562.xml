      This clinical trial studies dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast enhanced magnetic
      resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) after administration of ferumoxytol and dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) after administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent
      (GBCA) in viewing the vessels of the brain in younger patients with brain tumors.
      Ferumoxytol is an experimental form of very small iron particles that are taken by the blood
      stream to cells adjacent and inside the tumor. These iron particles may make it easier to
      see the areas of the brain that are affected by tumor. Ferumoxytol may work better than
      standard GBCA in viewing the vessels of the brain and brain tumor on MRI. Using ferumoxytol
      and GBCA in the same MRI session may provide more information about tumor blood supply and
      the extent of the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the vascular properties of pediatric brain tumors using ferumoxytol for
      DSC-MRI and GBCA for DCE-MRI in pediatric brain tumor (proven or presumptive) patients in a
      single MRI session.

      II. To describe evolving imaging characteristics of tumor vasculature using DSC-MRI with
      ferumoxytol and DCE-MRI with GBCA in pediatric brain tumor patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare and evaluate magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) with ferumoxytol between
      different time points.

      II. To describe number and size of tumors imaged. III. To assess histology and electron
      microscopy (EM) on tissue samples. IV. To demonstrate differences in patients with prior
      therapy versus (vs.) no prior therapy (radiation and/or chemotherapy).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ferumoxytol and gadolinium intravenously (IV) and then undergo DSC-MRI and
      DCE-MRI. An optional MRI without injection of a contrast agent may be obtained after 20-24
      hours at the discretion of the clinician. Patients may receive up to 3 more scans at least 3
      weeks apart over up to 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 4-6 weeks.
