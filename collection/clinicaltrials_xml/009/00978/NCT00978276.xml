      The purpose of this study is the identification and classification of human tissues and
      cytology specimens and elements therein.

      Computer aided technology to assist the pathologists to identify, quantify, characterize and
      report their findings with regards to one or more diagnoses they should perform. In
      particular and for example: the scoring of the number of elements and their protein
      (antibody) expression level within a paraffin embedded tissue section.

        The breast samples were taken from female patients after tru cut biopsies, lumpectomies or
        mastectomies. Paraffin embedded blocks were prepared from the specimens out of which
        sections were stained immunohistochemically with the Vision Bio Systems mouse monoclonal
        antibodies for Estrogen Receptor (NCL-ER-6F11) and Progesterone Receptor (NCL-PGR-312).
        All stages were performed under the routine procedure of the hospital laboratory.
