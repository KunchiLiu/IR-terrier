  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of Tekturna (aliskiren), in combination
      with an ACE and calcium channel blocker in hypertensive patients diagnosed with Type II
      diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on diabetic patients who are already on any blood pressure-lowering
      medication (excluding Tekturna) in addition to either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB
      (angiotensin receptor blocker) and still have a blood pressure greater than 130/80 mm Hg.
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effects of two different blood pressure treatment
      regimens, each containing three medications, on heart function in diabetics with
      uncontrolled hypertension. The two treatments are 1) lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor that works
      by reducing blood pressure) plus amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker that reduces blood
      pressure) plus aliskiren (a renin inhibitor, which also reduces blood pressure), or 2)
      lisinopril plus amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic, or &quot;water pill&quot;).
      Participants will have their coronary flow reserve - which is a measure of coronary vessel
      function, a predictor of future cardiovascular events - and a number of cardiovascular
      biomarkers in blood and urine at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. In this manner
      hydrochlorothiazide will be compared with aliskiren, which researchers think will have a
      better effect on heart artery blood flow.
