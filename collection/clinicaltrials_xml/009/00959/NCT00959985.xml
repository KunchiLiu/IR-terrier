    <textblock>
      Women who have been treated for breast cancer may be at risk for lymphedema or arm swelling.
      Currently, there are no clear treatment guidelines for lymphedema. One treatment method used
      to treat lymphedema is the use of compression sleeves to encourage the flow of lymph fluid
      out of the arms and prevent arm swelling in the future. Another treatment method is more
      intensive and involves wearing compression sleeves as well as special compression bandages
      overnight. It is unclear whether the use of compression with both sleeves and bandaging is
      more effective in treating lymphedema than the use of compression sleeves alone. The purpose
      of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of compression garments
      in preventing or slowing the progression of lymphedema in breast cancer patients.

      -  Because no one knows which of the study options is best, participant's will be
           randomized into one of the study groups. Participants with mild lymphedema will be
           randomized into either Group 1A or Group 1B. Participants with moderate lymphedema will
           be randomized into either Group 2A or Group 2B.

        -  All study participants will meet with a lymphedema physical therapist to review daily
           shoulder range of motion exercises to help minimize their arm swelling. They will be
           asked to record their range of motion exercises and activities in a study treatment
           journal. Participants will bring their journal to each study visit (every 4 weeks).

        -  Group 1A will only be required to meet with the lymphedema physical therapist as
           described above.

        -  Group 1B and Group 2A will be fitted with a compression sleeve at their first
           lymphedema physical therapy visit. They will wear the sleeve for a minimum of 12 hours
           per day.

        -  Group 2B will also be fitted with a compression sleeve at their first lymphedema
           physical therapy visit and will wear the sleeve for a minimum of 12 hours per day. They
           will also be instructed to wear a short-stretch compression bandage that goes from the
           top of the hand to the armpit. They will be asked to wear this compression bandage
           during the night. The overnight compression bandage should be worn for at least 5
           nights out of the week.

        -  Participants will come to the clinic every 4 weeks. The following tests and procedures
           will be performed: height and weight measurements; review of any side effects; arm
           volume measurements for both arms; questionnaire.

          -  Known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because of their
             poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that
             would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of primary lymphedema

          -  Any patient who has bilateral lymph node mapping or dissection

          -  Any patient with a current case of cellulitis

          -  Patients with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are
             eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the
             investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with
             the following cancer are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years:
