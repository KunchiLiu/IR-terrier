    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of weight loss via hypocaloric diet,
      aerobic exercise training, combined hypocaloric diet and exercise training, and attention
      control in patients with heart failure and a normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) and body mass
      index greater than or equal to 30.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with a normal ejection fraction (HFNEF, previously termed diastolic heart
      failure), accounts for the majority of heart failure cases in the population &gt; 65 years old
      and has been recognized as a true geriatric syndrome. Exercise intolerance is the primary
      chronic symptom of HFNEF and a major determinant of these patients' severely reduced quality
      of life; however little is known regarding its pathophysiology and treatment. Therefore, our
      work has focused on understanding the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance in HFNEF and
      developing and testing interventions that may improve this pivotal outcome in this highly
      prevalent disorder of older persons. The aims of the proposed study are to conduct a
      randomized, controlled, single-blinded, 2x2 design trial to examine the effects of weight
      loss via hypocaloric diet, aerobic exercise training, combined hypocaloric diet and exercise
      training, and attention control in patients with HFNEF and body mass index &gt;30 in order to
      test the following hypotheses: 1) Both weight loss and exercise training will improve
      exercise intolerance and quality of life in older, obese patients with HFNEF; 2) The
      combination of weight loss and exercise training will produce complementary effects on body
      and thigh muscle composition and additive improvements in exercise intolerance in HFNEF; 3)
      Improvements in exercise intolerance will correlate with improvements in lean body mass,
      reversal of adverse thigh muscle remodeling, and increased thigh muscle capillarity. The
      study has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of exercise intolerance
      and its treatment in the large population of older persons with HFNEF.
