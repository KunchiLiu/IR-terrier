  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anecdotal evidence suggests female patients with painful bladder disorder interstitial
      cystitis (IC) can experience a significant attenuation of their systems while breastfeeding.
      Since it has been shown that postpartum lactation is a time associated with decreased levels
      of stress, and stress has been shown to exacerbate IC-related pain, the investigators have
      developed an interest in the effects of the hormones involved in postpartum lactation on
      stress and pain. Based on a series of pre-clinical experiments, the investigators believe
      the hormone oxytoxin has both analgesic and anxiolytic properties which make it a
      potentially useful agent for the treatment of stress-exacerbated chronic pain syndrome such
      as IC. Therefore, the investigators propose a double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover
      trial of intranasal oxytocin vs. intranasal saline for bladder pain in a cohort of patients
      with IC and some degree of continuous, daily pain.

      Fifty patients will be enrolled in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled single-dose
      crossover trial comparing intranasal oxytocin to intranasal saline. At the time of
      enrollment, patients will complete a series of standardized questionnaires detailing
      information about their IC-related symptoms at baseline as well as comorbid conditions,
      coping mechanisms (specifically catastrophizing), and baseline ratings of overall pain,
      depression, anxiety, and global functioning. Once this information is obtained, the patient
      will receive a one-time dose of intranasal oxytocin or an equivalent volume of intranasal
      saline. The patients will be monitored for one hour by a physician investigator for
      toxicities and efficacy and then contacted for follow-up information at 2, 4, 6, and 24
      hours. At each of these time points, the patient will be asked to report a verbal pain
      report, a verbal anxiety report, the number of voids since last contact with an
      investigator, and the use of any additional medications for pain control or anxiety. In
      addition, a global response assessment (GRA) score will be obtained at 6 and 24 hours. The
      patient will be asked to return within a one week period at which time he/she will receive
      the alternative intranasal agent. Following the second dose, the patient will be monitored
      for one hour and contact made at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours as previously described.

      The primary outcome measure will be the GRA score, which will be analyzed using a Chi-square
      analysis followed by Fischer's exact test. Secondary outcome measures will be analyzed via
      ANOVA.

      If this study indicates that intranasal oxytocin is efficacious for pain control, this could
      provide for an alternative to current ineffective or invasive treatments for IC-related
      pain. It is also possible it could eventually be utilized for other forms of chronic pain as
      well.
