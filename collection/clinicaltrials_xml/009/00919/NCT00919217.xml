  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' overall hypothesis is that appearance or worsening of relapsing-remitting
      multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) symptoms are affected by various factors including stress,
      hormonal cycles, illness and missed medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluctuations in MS symptoms in women with RR-MS might be affected by a variety of factors.
      To determine which factors are important, we are asking subjects to fill out a diary and
      calendar on a daily basis for 90 days. After an initial instructional meeting over the
      phone, the materials are filled out at home and returned monthly via postage-paid envelopes
      provided by the study. Compensation ($10 gift card) is sent after each monthly diary is
      received. The diary includes a list of symptoms and a rank scale for the women to show
      subtle changes in MS symptoms. The calendar allows the subject to denote additional factors
      such as stress, hormonal cycles, illnesses or immunizations and changed or missed
      medications. We anticipate that statistical analysis will reveal which of these factors
      affect women with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
