    <textblock>
      The Third Eye Retroscope is a device that can be used with a colonoscope to improve the
      ability of a physician to see areas of the colon that may be hidden from the view of the
      colonoscope.

      Previous studies have shown that physicians are able to detect additional polyps when they
      use the device along with the colonoscope. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      physicians can detect greater numbers of additional polyps as they gain in experience with
      the device.

      Purpose: This study is intended to determine characteristics of the &quot;learning curve&quot; for use
      of the Third Eye Retroscope during colonoscopy, both in terms of efficacy for detection of
      abnormalities in the colon and time-efficiency for endoscopists

      Device Description: The Third Eye Retroscope is an auxiliary imaging device that is designed
      to allow visualization of &quot;hidden areas&quot; during colonoscopy by providing an additional,
      retrograde view that complements the forward view of the colonoscope.

      After a standard colonoscope has been advanced to the cecum, the Third Eye Retroscope is
      inserted through the instrument channel of the colonoscope. As it emerges from the distal
      tip of the colonoscope, the Third Eye Retroscope automatically bends 180 degrees to form a
      &quot;J&quot; shape. Its sensor then provides a continuous retrograde view of the colon throughout the
      process of withdrawal of the colonoscope.

      The retrograde view assists the endoscopist in visualizing the proximal aspect of haustral
      folds and rectal valves, as well as the areas behind flexures and the ileocecal valve. With
      this additional point-of-view, the endoscopist may be able to detect lesions that can be
      missed by the forward-viewing colonoscope.

      Study Design: Patients who are scheduled for colonoscopy will be recruited to the study and
      examined with the Third Eye Retroscope in conjunction with a standard colonoscope. For each
      polyp that is found, the endoscopist will indicate whether it could be seen with the
      colonoscope, or if it could be found with the colonoscope only because it was first detected
      with the Third Eye.

      Each investigator will perform colonoscopies on 20 patients, who will be segmented into four
      quartiles according to the order of their procedures. Mean results for the quartiles will be
      compared in order to evaluate the learning curve for Third Eye colonoscopy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is undergoing colonoscopy for screening, for surveillance in follow-up of
             previous polypectomy or for diagnostic workup;

          2. The patient must understand and provide written consent for the procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of colonic resection;

          2. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease;

          3. Patients with a personal history of polyposis syndrome;

          4. Patients with suspected chronic stricture potentially precluding complete
             colonoscopy;

          5. Patients with diverticulitis or toxic megacolon;

          6. Patients with a history of radiation therapy to abdomen or pelvis.

          7. Patients who are currently enrolled in another clinical investigation in which the
             intervention might compromise the safety of the patient's participation in this
             study.
