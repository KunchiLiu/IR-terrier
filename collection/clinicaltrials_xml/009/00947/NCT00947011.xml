  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate the effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1, a
      naturally occurring hormone) on insulin release and to examine whether there is extra
      insulin release when GLP-1 is not allowed to be rapidly inactivated.

      The purpose of the present proposal is to 1) examine the role of DPP-4 inhibition on insulin
      release during a hyperglycemic clamp while GLP-1 is being infused and, 2) further elucidate
      the role of the metabolite of GLP-1, that is GLP-1 9-36 amide (GLP-1m). During stable and
      very reproducible elevated plasma glucose levels the effect of increased active incretin
      levels with DPP-4 inhibitors should result in increased plasma insulin levels. Therefore the
      aim of this protocol is to document whether plasma insulin levels are increased following
      GLP-1 infusion in the presence or absence of DPP-4 inhibitors. Additionally, we have shown
      that some improvement in glucose homeostasis during GLP-1 administration is due in part to
      the metabolite of GLP-1, i.e. GLP-1 (9-36) amide (GLP-1m). Therefore, we will also test the
      role of the latter by infusing GLP-1m when the volunteers are being treated with DPP-4
      inhibitors.
