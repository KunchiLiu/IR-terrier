    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single intravenous administration of an
      N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist is safe and effective for the acute treatment of bipolar
      depression.

    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a common, recurrent, and disabling medical condition. Although
      mania is the defining feature of BPD, depression represents the majority of illness burden
      in patients with this devastating condition. Despite the high degree of morbidity and
      mortality associated with bipolar depression, currently available treatments are few and
      often inadequate. Recently, a single intravenous (IV) dose of the N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine has demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects
      in severe unipolar depression. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of a single IV dose of ketamine in treatment-resistant
      bipolar depression (TRBD.
