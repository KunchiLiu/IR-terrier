  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that radiation therapy could be safely administered acutely
      after elbow trauma, and it would decrease the number of patients that would require surgical
      excision of heterotopic ossification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-institutional, prospective randomized clinical trial will be employed to determine
      if single dose, limited field radiation therapy (XRT) will prevent post-traumatic
      heterotopic ossification (HO) after open reduction internal fixation of intra-articular
      distal humerus fractures and fracture-dislocations of the elbow and to assess function of
      the elbow after XRT and no XRT. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      groups(XRT/treatment or no XRT/control) by a computer-generated randomization schedule.
      Assignment will be in a ratio of 1:1 in a complete block design of 10. Each clinical site
      will be provided with a separate randomization assignment for each study participant. The
      treating surgeon and patient will be blinded to group assignment until after operative
      treatment. Clinical and radiographic assessments at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months
      post-operatively will be performed. The primary clinical outcome will be the Mayo elbow
      performance score which measures pain, stability, function and motion. Motion parameters
      (flexion, extension, pronation and supination) will be performed at each data collection
      point. Primary radiographic outcome will be the presence of heterotopic ossification by
      plain radiographs of the elbow in the antero-posterior and lateral planes at 6 weeks, 3
      months, and 6 months post-operatively. Further imaging (radiograph or CT) will be obtained
      past the 6-month interval if deemed necessary by the treating physician,or if fracture union
      was not achieved at 6 months. The classification systems described by Brooker et al and
      Ilahi et al will be used to quantify the presence of HO by radiograph. All adverse events
      will be documented. The trial will be monitored periodically by the Safety Monitor at least
      twice a year to ensure protocol compliance and address safety issues.

    <description>The dose will be 700 cGy in a single fraction, using AP-PA fields calculated to midplane. No Less than 6MV energy photons will be used, and no bolus is placed on the skin. The field covers the entire joint, the antecubital fossa and the olecranon process. A strip of skin at the antecubital area is generally shielded, but is not an absolute requirement for this study.</description>
