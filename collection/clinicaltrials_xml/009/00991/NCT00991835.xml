  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque is responsible for at least two-thirds of acute
      coronary syndrome. Thus, identification of plaques vulnerable to rupture has become
      important. The natural history of individual plaques is unknown and needs to be established.
      Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography is a useful noninvasive imaging
      modality for assessing coronary plaque characteristics. Using MDCT, the researchers
      prospectively investigate the relationship between the characterization of coronary plaques
      and cardiovascular events in a large multicenter study.
