      This study will be a prospective, non-randomized evaluation of the change between
      preoperative and postoperative outcomes for those receiving the Triathlon® TS Total Knee
      System for a revision knee operation. The mean total Knee Society Score (for pain, motion
      and function) change is not 10% worse than, or is superior to, the expected change according
      to published revision total knee replacement data, for cases implanted with the Triathlon®
      TS Total Knee System as compared from preoperative to 2 years postoperative.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Society Score (KSS) change from preoperative time point to 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-op, 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Total KSS, KSS Pain score, KSS Function score. The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, ROM and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of joint line restoration on post-op stability, anterior knee pain &amp; functional performance.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years, 5 years</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36 Health Survey change from pre-op to post-op visits</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-op, 1, 2, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a 36-item patient completed questionnaire to measure general health and well-being. It includes a physical and mental status component score; each ranging from 0-100. Low values represent a poor health state and high values represent a good health state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic stability</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Parameters for radiographic failures will follow the guidelines that have been set by the Knee Society. The scoring system for each of the three components is determined by measuring the width of the radiolucent lines for each of the zones in millimeters for each of the three components. The total widths are added for each zone for each of the three prostheses. The total produces a numerical score for each component. Failure is defined as a score of 10 or greater, regardless of symptoms. A migrating or shifting prosthesis, with or without the disappearance of radiolucent lines, should be considered as a possible or impending failure regardless of the score. Radiolucency in at least 50% of a zone and measuring at least 1 mm in width is defined as radiolucency present. Subsidence is defined as settling of the prosthetic component in bone, and is related to the distance between fixed bony landmarks on the tibia and the prosthesis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) change from pre-op to post-op visits</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-op, 1, 2, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). The last week is taken into consideration when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HSS Patella Score change from pre-op to post-op visits</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-op, 1, 2, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The HSS Patella Score incorporates both subjective symptoms and objective data specific to the patellofemoral joint. It consists of one score from 0-100 with a score of 100 indicating no pain, no functional limitations, no tenderness or crepitus and normal quadriceps strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Extremity Activity Scale score change from pre-op to post-op visits</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-op, 1, 2, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The LEAS is completed by the participant to assess activity level. Activity levels were ordered in terms of intensity from 1 to 18, with 18 indicating the highest activity level.</description>
