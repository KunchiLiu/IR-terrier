  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to test an experimental new drug called, EMD 525797 (Study Drug).
      This drug is not yet approved for sale and has only been tested in a small number of people
      to date (prior to this study starting another research study was carried out involving 37
      healthy volunteers receiving the Study Drug). Until more is known about this Study Drug, it
      can only be used in research studies.

      This research study is planned to answer important questions about how the Study Drug is
      tolerated and how it may work in patients with prostate cancer with bone metastases.

      This is a small study which is expected to include 24 patients, and will be conducted in
      approximately 3 hospitals in Germany and 1 hospital in Brussels, Belgium. The study will
      last until the last patient has had their last study visit which is expected to be about 18
      months in total.

    <description>EMD 525797 will be administered as an i.v. over 1 hour every two weeks for 6 weeks. Subjects with clinical benefit at end of week 6 will be offered continuation of treatment with EMD 525797 at the same dose-level until disease progression, intolerance to treatment, withdrawal of consent or in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is no longer benefiting from treatment.
Dose escalation carried out as follows:
Dose-level 1: 250 mg of EMD 525797 i.v. Dose-level 2: 500 mg dose of EMD 525797 i.v. Dose-level 3: 1000 mg dose of EMD 525797 i.v. Dose-level 4: 1500 mg dose of EMD 525797 i.v.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of signed written informed consent

          2. Age superior or equal to 18 years

          3. Subjects with histological or cytologically proven prostate cancer with evidence of
             bone metastases on bone scans or CT / MRI after prior chemotherapy with e.g. taxane
             or mitoxantrone Patients should have undergone bilateral orchiectomy or should be on
             continuous androgen deprivation therapy with a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist
             or antagonist and should have stopped any anti-androgen therapy for at least 4 weeks
             before inclusion in the study. Patients should be either on stable (i.e., since at
             least 3 months) ongoing therapy with a bisphosphonate or without any bisphosphonate
             therapy. Initiation of a bisphosphonate therapy within this time period prior the
             study or during the study is not allowed. Total serum testosterone should be less
             than 50 ng/dL or 1.7 nmol/L.

          4. Evidence of progressive disease, defined by at least two PSA values above the
             individual nadir level with an increase of at least 10% each determined at a minimum
             interval of 2 weeks before screening examination. Presence of a measurable lesion is
             not required for study entry. Nodal (in lymph nodes superior or equal to 2cm) or
             visceral progression is sufficient for trial entry independent of PSA.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 at study entry
             and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          6. Adequate hematological function, defined by white blood cell count (WBC) greater than
             or equal to 3 x 109/L with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to
             1.5 x 109/L, and lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 0.5 x 109/L; platelet
             count greater than or equal to 100 x 109/L; and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9
             g/dL.

          7. Adequate hepatic function defined by total bilirubin level less than or equal to 1.5
             times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN; or, for
             subjects with documented metastatic disease to the liver, AST and ALT levels less
             than or equal to 5 x ULN.

          8. Adequate renal function defined by serum creatinine less than 1.5 mg/dL.

          9. Effective contraception. If the risk of conception exists, pregnancy has to be
             avoided during the study (SCR to EOS) as well as during at least 3 month after last
             dosing using an effective contraception method (e.g. double barrier method)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any systemic cytotoxic cancer treatment within 4 weeks before treatment with EMD
