    <textblock>
      Temple University is looking for women to participate in a study to evaluate the treatment
      options available to women living with binge eating disorder.

      Binge-Eating Disorder is a significant public health problem for women. Despite this, there
      is limited research on how best to treat this disorder at varying levels of severity. The
      purpose of this NIMH-funded study is to enroll individuals in a brief form of
      cognitive-behavior therapy. If more intense treatment is needed, individuals will be
      randomly assigned to more intensive group and individual treatments (Cognitive-Behavior
      Therapy or Dialectical Behavior Therapy). Both of these treatments are talking therapies
      that have been adapted for women living with binge-eating disorder and are free of charge.
