    <textblock>
      Clinical data demonstrate that a cocaine vaccine (TA-CD: Celtic Pharmaceutical) produces
      selective anti-cocaine antibodies, yet the impact of these antibodies on cocaine's direct
      effects is unknown. The objective of this human laboratory study was to measure the
      relationship between antibody titers and the effects of smoked cocaine on ratings of
      intoxication, craving and cardiovascular effects.

      Cocaine-dependent volunteers not seeking drug treatment spend 2 nights per week for 13 weeks
      inpatient where the effects of cocaine (0, 25, 50 mg) are determined prior to vaccination
      and at weekly intervals thereafter. Vaccinations occur at weeks 1, 3, 5 and 9.

          3. Age 21-45.

          4. Females must be surgically sterilized or post- menopausal

          5. Able to give informed consent, and comply with study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Judged to be noncompliant with study protocol.

          3. History of autoimmune disease, immune deficiency or hypersensitivity to other
             vaccines. An HIV test must be negative.

          4. Currently uses drugs intravenously

          5. Currently taking any psychotropic medication

          6. Laboratory tests that are clinically unacceptable to the study physician (BP &gt;
             140/90; BUN, creatinine, LFTs &gt; 1.5 ULN; hematocrit &lt; 34 for women, &lt; 36 for men)

          7. Blood or blood products given in the three months prior to vaccination

          8. Other vaccines, including flu vaccine, given within 30 days of screening.

          9. Ongoing active infection

         10. Currently taking immunosuppressives -
