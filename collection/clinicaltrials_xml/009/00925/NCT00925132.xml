  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to treat metastatic melanoma with a combination of standard
      chemotherapy (decitabine and Temozolomide in a dose escalation scheme) with an study drug
      called panobinostat. This combination is proposed to unlock genes that may contribute to
      mechanisms that cause tumor growth.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the proposed schedule of decitabine,
           temozolomide and panobinostat in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

        -  To define any Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
           combination of decitabine, temozolomide and panobinostat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most chemotherapeutics target rapidly proliferating cells, leaving quiescent cells and those
      with extended cell cycles unaffected. The investigators propose that this combination of
      decitabine, temozolomide, and panobinostat will target both melanoma stem cells and rapidly
      proliferating melanoma cells. The use of two drugs that regulate gene expression
      epigenetically (panobinostat and decitabine) in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent
      (temozolomide) is hypothesized to:

        -  induce expression genes (e.g., Apaf-1) that increase chemosensitivity of tumor cells
           and enhance apoptosis

        -  potentiate the cytotoxic effect of temozolomide by epigenetic modulation, and

        -  induce proliferation and differentiation of tumor stem cells, thus enabling senescence
           and apoptosis.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To measure overall survival

        -  To measure the time to progression of patients treated with this combination in
           comparison to patients treated historically with DTIC (the current standard of care).

        -  To evaluate treatment response with FDG PET and compare FDG PET with conventional
           imaging for treatment response assessment.
