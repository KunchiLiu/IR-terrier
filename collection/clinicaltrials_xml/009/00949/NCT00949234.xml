  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this program is to evaluate an effort to provide a comprehensive package of
      HIV prevention services of which post-exposure prophylaxis (medicines that may help prevent
      HIV infection after an exposure) can be a part. It will also include risk reduction
      information and testing for other sexually transmitted infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Los Angeles County P-QUAD program is a combined effort of County, City, public health,
      community, academic, and private agencies and individuals in an effort to provide a
      comprehensive package of HIV prevention services of which PEP can be an integral component.
      These services are designed to be easily accessible, non-judgmental, culturally, ethnically,
      and linguistically appropriate to the relevant populations, community-based, and independent
      of ability to pay or insurance/documentation status. They will also provide vital linkages
      to associated services, routine HIV testing, and primary health care.

      In its initial pilot project, 2 community-based sites will serve as facilities at which
      patients may present for screening for post-exposure prophylaxis services, as well as
      sexually transmitted diseases. At the sites, initial eligibility and testing will be
      performed, and an initial 14-day supply of PEP medications will be provided if appropriate,
      and referrals will be initiated. All subjects who are provided an initial 14-day supply will
      be required to return to the site for the remainder of the 28-day course of medication,
      follow-up testing, adherence counseling, risk-reduction programming, and other appropriate
      referrals. Follow-up with patients by phone, email, and mobile-phone text message will be
      used as appropriate to maximize program retention.

    <description>The preferred regimen will be tenofovir + emtricitabine, provided as a fixed-dose combination tablet as TruvadaÂ®. Dosing is 1 tablet by mouth once daily. For participants with a creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min, dosing of Truvada is 1 tablet by mouth every other day. For patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min or on hemodialysis, Truvada should not be used. For intolerance to Truvada, Combivir (zidovudine 300mg/lamivudine 150mg)will be available to be taken as 1 PO BID. For highest-risk category exposures (receptive anal intercourse with a known or suspected HIV-positive source patient or in cases of suspected source drug resistance, see Schema, below) one of the following should be added to the above &quot;standard&quot; treatment, creating an &quot;expanded&quot; regimen:
Preferred: Lopinavir/ritonavir (200mg/50mg), 2 tablets orally twice daily or 4 tablets once daily</description>
