  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with omalizumab (Xolair, anti-IgE)
      can eliminate or reduce symptoms of peanut allergy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate if omalizumab is an effective treatment for peanut allergy. In
      addition we will further evaluate the role of allergic cells (mast cells and basophils) and
      IgE in food allergy.

        Females, excluding those more than 1 year postmenopausal or who are surgically sterile,
        must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 and other visits specified in this
        protocol. If a subject becomes pregnant during the study participation, they will be
        discharged from the study and followed for any adverse events until termination of the
        pregnancy or delivery is complete. Given that the drug is in pregnancy category B, we will
        follow the pregnant mother for any adverse events for the duration of the study.

          -  Physician diagnosed peanut allergy OR convincing clinical history of peanut allergy
             with its onset in early childhood.

          -  Positive puncture skin test to peanut greater than or equal to 3 mm diluent control

          -  Positive ImmunoCAP to peanut â‰¥0.35 kU/L.

          -  In vitro basophil responsiveness to peanut allergen, with greater than 20% histamine
             release or 10-19% if greater than 50% of an optimal anti-IgE response (at baseline
             visit).

          -  Subjects must have a positive oral food challenge to peanut as defined by having
             objective signs of a clear allergic reaction at a cumulative dose of peanut protein
             &lt;1000 mg. Objective allergic signs may include oral urticaria, cutaneous urticaria,
             rhinorrhea, sneezing, coughing, wheezing, or vomiting.

             months.

          -  Patients with plans to become pregnant or breastfeed will be excluded from the study.
             Patients must indicate they will use methods to avoid pregnancy.

          -  Other significant medical conditions (e.g., liver, gastrointestinal, kidney,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary disease, or blood disorders), which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, make the subject unsuitable for induction of food reactions.

          -  Significant upper respiratory tract infection (URI) within 7 days of any OFC; OFCs
             should be rescheduled within 7 days following resolution of URI.

          -  Mental illness or history of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study
             requirements.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or
             comply with study protocol.
