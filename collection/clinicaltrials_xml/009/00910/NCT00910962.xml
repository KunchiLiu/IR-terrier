    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-center study
      to evaluate initial safety and efficacy of GW856553 in subjects with NSTEMI. Up to
      approximately 525 subjects will be randomized to meet the MRI recruitment target (90
      subjects in substudy.) All subjects will continue to receive the local standard of care for
      the duration of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a NSTEMI, defined as: symptoms (e.g. chest pain, dyspnea) consistent
             with acute coronary syndrome, lasting at least 10 minutes, with most recent symptoms
             occurring within the 24 hours prior to presentation, without persistent ST-segment
             elevation on admission 12-lead ECG, and with Troponin (T or I) above the upper limit
             of normal (ULN) for the local institution within 18 hours of presentation.

          -  Subject able to be randomized within 18 hours of presentation.

          -  Subjects to be managed with an early invasive strategy, with PCI likely to occur at
             least 2 hours after the start of dosing [subjects who do not undergo PCI will not be
             withdrawn from the study].

          -  Male or female subject who is 45 years of age or older.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy;
             or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable
             cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater
             than 40 MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 140 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory), or child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception
             methods listed in the protocol for the duration of dosing and until the first
             follow-up visit (approximately 2 weeks post last-dose).

          -  Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (in women of child-bearing potential only).

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until the first follow-up visit (approximately 2 weeks post last-dose).

          -  QTcB or QTcF greater than 530 msec.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Any other subject whom the Investigator deems unsuitable for the study (e.g., due to

          -  Contraindication to MRI scanning (as assessed by local MRI safety questionnaire)
             which includes but is not limited to: intracranial aneurysm clips or other metallic
             objects; history of intra-orbital metal fragments that have not been removed by an
             MD; pacemakers and non-MR compatible heart valves; inner ear implants; history of
             claustrophobia in MR.

          -  Allergy to MRI contrast enhancement agent (gadolinium).

          -  Estimated creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault formula &lt; 30 mL/min.
