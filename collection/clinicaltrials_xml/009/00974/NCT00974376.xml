      This is a 12-week, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of
      gabapentin in treating outpatients with cannabis dependence. After an initial phone screen,
      a comprehensive screening visit is scheduled to determine eligibility. Baseline assessments
      using measurement instruments are conducted on cannabis use, neuropsychological functioning,
      withdrawal, craving, pain, mood and sleep. Upon enrollment, counseling, medication
      dispensation and research assessments occur 1 time per week for 3 months and include
      assessments in withdrawal, craving, pain, mood and sleep. A final, follow-up visit occurs at
      the end of the 3 months.
