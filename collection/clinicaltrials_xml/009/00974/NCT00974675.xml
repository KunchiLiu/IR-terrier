      This study includes subjects with asthma to participate in one of three groups and randomly
      assigned to a group to receive the drug for the study (CAT-354) or placebo.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study. Following confirmation
      of eligibility, subjects with moderate asthma will be recruited sequentially to one of three
      dose groups and randomly assigned within dose group to either CAT-354 or placebo. Doses of
      the assigned treatment will be administered on three occasions 28 days apart. Follow up for
      pharmacokinetic blood sampling and safety will continue to Day 147 post first dose (91 days
      post third dose).
