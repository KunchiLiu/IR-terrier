  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of oral Cyclosporine A (CsA)
      in patients with advanced stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of the
      study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CsA as a therapy for the adaptive
      immune response in advanced stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

      Subjects between 45 and 80 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of advanced stage COPD,
      not responsive to conventional inhaler therapy, who meet all the study requirements, will be
      enrolled in this study. A total of 30 subjects of either sex will be enrolled in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 45 and 80 years

          -  A confirmed diagnosis of advanced stage COPD, using current accepted diagnostic
             criteria, including clinical/laboratory findings, pulmonary function tests, and
             appropriate history to exclude other disorders that could explain their lung disease.
             The accepted range of FEV1 will include 25% ≤FEV1 ≤ 60%

          -  Subjects agree to maintain a stable medication regimen in the absence of a disease
             flare

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  pCO2 &lt; 45 mm Hg, room air oxyhemoglobin saturation &gt; 85%

          -  A willingness to participate in all portions of the protocol, including serial
             bronchoscopy, requisite surveillances, and ancillary immunologic studies in follow-up
             visits at this institution

          -  For woman of childbearing age, a negative pregnancy test, and a willingness to use
             two methods of contraception, or abstinence

             systemic corticosteroids, or one exacerbation requiring hospitalization in the past 6
             months

             consent
