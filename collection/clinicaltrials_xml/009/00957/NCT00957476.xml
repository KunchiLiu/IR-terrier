      In addition to the increase in obesity in adult and children, there has been a significant
      increase in birth weights over the last 2 decades. Based on our preliminary data, maternal
      pre-gravid obesity is the strongest risk factor for neonatal as well as adolescent obesity.
      The long-term goals of our research are to examine therapeutic strategies to decrease fetal
      adiposity. Obesity and pregnancy are both insulin resistant conditions associated with
      chronic low-grade inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that n-3 PUFA dietary supplements
      during pregnancy will act as insulin sensitizers decreasing peripheral insulin resistance
      and inflammation. If correct this mechanism should decrease availability of maternal
      nutrients to the fetus and subsequently reduce adiposity at birth. We plan a prospective
      randomized double blind control trial of n-3 PUFA supplementation and placebo in
      overweight/obese women, with a previous cesarean delivery, initiated in early pregnancy and
      maintained throughout pregnancy. This proposal has two specific aims. Specific aim 1 is to
      evaluate the effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation on maternal insulin sensitivity. Measures of
      maternal insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism will be made using the ISogtt, indirect
      calorimetry body composition (BODPOD) and plasma lipid profile at baseline and after dietary
      intervention.

      Specific aim 2 will assess the effect of n-3 PUFA on the inflammatory status in
      overweight/obese pregnant women. We hypothesize that n-3 PUFA supplementation decreases
      chronic inflammation during pregnancy by preventing monocyte activation and accumulation of
      macrophages in WAT thus lowering systemic concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We
      plan to characterize the longitudinal changes in circulating monocytes and plasma adipokines
      in order to define the inflammatory patterns in both groups over time. We will also
      determine the abundance and phenotype of macrophages infiltrating WAT using flow cytometry,
      immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling. Furthermore, the role of PPARγ as a
      central target of n-3 PUFA action to regulate insulin sensitivity will be examined by
      characterizing the expression of PPARγ in WAT of both supplemented and control groups.
      Additionally, we will investigate the direct affect of n-3 PUFA on the expression of
      adiponectin and PPARγ regulated genes in primary cultured adipocytes.

      In summary, this proposal combines both clinical and molecular methodologies in an
      overweight/obese subject population in order to assess the effect of n-3 PUFA on
      inflammation and insulin resistance. Preliminary data will also be obtained on fetal body
      composition in order to later address the prevention of the long term adverse effects
      (developmental programming) of maternal obesity in the developing fetus.

          -  Gestational age at randomization between 8-16 weeks

          -  No medical problems such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or pregestational diabetes

          -  Between the ages of 18 and 40 years old

          -  Women who are vegetarians and do not eat any fish.

          -  Infants born preterm (less than 36 weeks gestation) or less than 2kg.

             exclude women who develop GDM during pregnancy but consider a sub-analyses of these
             women depending on the number of subjects. Known maternal medical complications:
             cancer (including melanoma but excluding other skin cancers).

          -  Current hyperthyroidism if not adequately controlled.

             history of alloimmune thrombocytopenia in a previous offspring, significant anemia
             due to hemoglobinopathy but not sickle cell trait. Iron deficiency anemia will NOT be
             an exclusion as long as the hemoglobin is &gt; 8 gm/dl).

          -  Chronic pulmonary disease (asthma of any degree of severity is NOT an exclusion).

          -  Structural, functional or ischemic heart disease. Neither mitral valve prolapse nor
             paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia are considered exclusions.

          -  Known HIV positive with viral load greater than 1,000 copies/ml or CD4 count less
             than 350/mm3.

          -  Current or planned cerclage due to interference with the natural cause of delivery.

          -  Illicit drug or alcohol abuse during current pregnancy.

          -  At the time of birth, all infants will be evaluated by a pediatrician to make sure
             that they are healthy. Infants will be excluded from further study if they have any
             medical problems such as respiratory distress syndrome.

          -  Infants will also be excluded if they have any problems that exclude them from having
             estimation of body composition, for e.g. birth weight less than 2 kg.
