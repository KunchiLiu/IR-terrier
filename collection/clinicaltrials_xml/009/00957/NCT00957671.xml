  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen to twenty percent of adults who suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) that requires
      hospitalization and rehabilitation have been found to have growth hormone (GH) deficiency by
      GH stimulation testing. Moreover, abnormalities have also been established for the cortisol
      and thyroid axis. The hypothesis of this proposal is that hormone replacement in TBI
      patients with documented abnormalities in the GH, thyroid, or cortisol axis will improve
      muscle function, body composition, aerobic capacity (GH) and tests of neuropsychologic
      function (GH, thyroid, cortisol).

      This protocol is designed to screen and detect evidence of pituitary hormone deficiency in
      adults following traumatic brain injury. Treatment period for thyroid or cortisol deficiency
      will be six months. Growth hormone deficiency will be replaced for a period of one year
      followed by a second year of open label treatment to allow individuals in the placebo group
      an opportunity to demonstrate a response to hormone replacement. Subject will not be
      screened until at least one year following brain injury to allow for natural recovery of
      hormone function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 21 and older.

          -  Documented moderate to severe traumatic brain injury at least one year post injury.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The only absolute exclusionary medication will be an anticoagulant (Coumadin) because
             of the risk of bleeding during the possible muscle biopsy procedure and daily
             injections of rhGH in the GH arm of the study.

          -  Any subject with a history of hepatitis or a 3-fold elevation of liver function tests
             (Alk phos, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)). We are
             uncertain of the effects of hormone replacement such as rhGH on the liver, so we will
             exclude any subjects with hepatitis. This exclusion applies only to subjects who
             would be enrolled in the GH arm of the study.

          -  Subjects who are deficient in cortisol or thyroid at screening will be excluded until
             hormone abnormalities have been corrected.

          -  Subjects with chronic pain who are being managed with narcotics will be excluded as
             the effects of central nervous system depressants may interfere with study test
             results.
