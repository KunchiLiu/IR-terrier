  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether imaging with 18F-choline PET/CT can
      provide information that may help guide subsequent investigational or clinical treatments
      for patients with advanced (hormone-refractory) metastatic prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who meet eligibility criteria and are enrolled will undergo whole-body imaging with
      18F-choline PET/CT at 3 time points during the course of treatment that is indicated for
      castrate resistant prostate cancer. The 1st PET/CT scan is performed at baseline before
      treatment initiation. The 2nd and 3rd scans are performed at two other treatment-releated
      timepoints or at approximately 1 month and 3 months after treatment initiation. Change in
      lesion 18F-choline uptake from baseline measured at each time point will be determined.
      Cancer 18F-choline uptake will be evaluated as a marker of therapeutic response in
      comparison to PSA response and symptom scores. Treatment-related changes in tumor
      18F-choline uptake occur will be studied after the second and third PET scans to determine
      the acuity by which changes in tumor 18F-choline uptake can be expected following specific
      treatments for castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The study evaluates a diagnostic
      intervention and the treatments themselves are not considered part of the investigation. All
      treatment decisions will be made independent of the study and must be deemed
      clinically-warranted by a treating physician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of written informed consent.

          2. Men, over 18 years of age, with histologically-confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer

          3. History of treatment by complete androgen blockade for greater than 3 months prior to
             enrollment

          4. Progressive disease evidenced by 2 consecutive rises in PSA measured at least 1 week
             apart, with the absolute value of the latest PSA &gt; 5.0 ng/ml.

          5. A rise in PSA following anti-androgen drug withdrawal, above the last PSA value
             before withdrawal.

          6. Patient has agreed to treatment for hormone-refractory (ie. castrate-resistant)
             prostate cancer under supervision of a medical oncologist, urologist, radiation
             oncologist or nuclear medicine physician. Treatments indicated for HRPC are
             docetaxel-, cabazitaxel-, or mitoxantrone-based chemotherapy, abiraterone,
             radium-223, enzalutamide, or sipulecuil-T.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or superficial transitional cell carcinoma of
             the bladder.

          2. Serious underlying medical conditions that would otherwise impair the patient's
             ability to undergo imaging.

          3. Patient weighs over 350 lbs (due to scanner weight limit).

          4. Clinical life expectancy &lt; 12 weeks.

          5. Participated in other radioactive drug studies where estimated total cumulative dose
             within 1 year is &gt; 0.05 Sievert for whole body, active blood-forming organs, eye
             lens, gonads, or 0.15 Sievert for other organs.

          6. Concurrent Therapy. Allowed: Prior or concurrent chemotherapy, but must be &gt; 12 weeks
             since last treatment at enrollment; prior or concurrent hormonal therapy; prior
             surgery; prior or concurrent bisphosphonate; prior or concurrent receptor/biologic
             agent allowed if given on approved study protocol.
