  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The durg vorinostat (Zolinza) is a type of drug called an histone deacetylase (HDAC)
      inhibitor. It inhibits a group of enzymes called histone deacetylases. These enzymes help
      cancer cells survive. By inhibiting these enzymes, vorinostat helps kill cancer cells. In
      this research study vorinostat will be given along with radiation therapy and the drug 5-FU.
      This is the first research study in which vorinostat will be given along with radiation
      therapy and 5-FU. The purpose of this research study is to find the highest dose of
      vorinostat that can be given safely along with radiation therapy and 5-FU. The investigators
      will also begin to get information about whether vorinostat combined with radiation and 5-FU
      may help to treat pancreatic cancer.

      -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of vorinostat that can be administered safely
           without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will receive
           the same dose. The dose will depend upon the number of participants enrolled on the
           study and how well they have tolerated their doses.

        -  5-FU will be given intravenously over 24 hours 7 days per week during each week of
           radiation therapy. In order for participants to be able to receive the 5-FU as an
           outpatient, they will need to have central line catheter placed.

        -  Radiation therapy will be given once per day, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks.

        -  Vorinostat is taken orally.

        -  Participants will be seen once per week during the 6 weeks that they are receiving
           5-FU, radiation therapy and vorinostat.
