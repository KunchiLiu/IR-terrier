  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of treatment of acute HIV infection with a once daily regimen of
      Emtricitabine, Tenofovir and Efavirenz. The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine the safety and tolerability, and the virologic and immunologic efficacy of
           FTC, TDF, and efavirenz given once daily to patients with acute HIV infection.

        2. To assess the impact of once daily therapy combined with a standardized adherence
           program on treatment adherence, virologic suppression, and rate of viral load decline
           in blood and infectious fluids (semen, cervico-vaginal secretions).

        3. To define the prevalence of genotypic and phenotypic resistance to antiretroviral
           agents among persons diagnosed with acute HIV infection in the Southeastern United
           States.

      Hypothesis: Once daily HAART with FTC/TDF (FDC, Truvada) + EFV administered as a single dose
      pill called Atripla will reduce viral replication to &lt;400 copies RNA/ml plasma in blood and
      other body compartments in patients with acute HIV infection, reducing infectivity, and
      permitting generation of HIV-specific immune responses. The treatment regimen will be well
      tolerated and any lipid profile changes will be modest during treatment follow-up. A
      coordinated program of counseling and support will facilitate adherence and promote
      successful therapy. Prevalence of transmitted drug resistant HIV-1 will be assessed.

      Study Design: Multi-center, prospective, single-arm pilot study of FTC/TDF/EFV in patients
      with acute HIV infection. Study sites will be members of the Duke-UNC Acute HIV Infection
      Study Consortium. Patients will be followed intensively for the first year with continued
      follow-up for an additional year pending developments on treatment cessation approaches for
      patients with suppressed virus and effective immune responses.

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;/= 8.5g/dL for men and &gt;/= 8.0 g/dL for women

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault formula) &gt;/= 50mL/min:

             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of bHCG) within 72

             experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization
             (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy), who is not
             postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea &gt;/=12 consecutive months), or is on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) with documented plasma follicle-stimulating hormone level
             &gt;/=35mLU/mL. Women who are using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive
             hormones or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods
             (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or
             where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy), should be considered to be of child
             bearing potential;

        Exclusion Criteria:

             administration.

          4. WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use two acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy
             for the entire study period

          5. WOCBP using a prohibited contraceptive method

          6. Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of study drugs.

          7. A clinically important illness not explicitly excluded by the protocol, a physical or
             psychiatric disability, or a laboratory abnormality that might place the patient at
             increased risk by being exposed to the medications in this study or which might
             confound the interpretation of this investigation.

          8. Proven or suspected acute hepatitis within 30 days prior to study entry (this
             excludes liver inflammation related to acute HIV infection).

          9. Intractable diarrhea (&gt;/=6 loose stools/day for at least 7 consecutive days) within
             30 days prior to study entry or vomiting lasting more than 4 days within one month
             prior to dosing (this excludes symptoms attributed to acute HIV infection).

         10. An active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or disease (for the purpose of this
             study, a CD4 count &lt;/=200 cells/mm3 in the absence of any other AIDS-defining
             indicator condition is not considered an AIDS-defining event. AIDS-defining events
             occurring during the acute HIV infection syndrome period such as Candida esophagitis
             will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will not be automatically considered
             exclusionary).

         11. Inability to communicate effectively with study personnel.

         12. Current alcohol or recreational drug use which in the investigator's opinion
             interferes with the subject's ability to comply with dosing schedule and protocol
             evaluations or increases the risk of developing pancreatitis.

         13. Incarceration; prisoner recruitment and participation are not permitted.

         14. Difficulty swallowing capsules/tablets.

         15. Prior treatment with any other experimental drug for any indication (within 30 days
             of initiating study treatment).

         16. Treatment with immune-modulating agents (within 30 days of initiating study
             treatment) such as cyclosporine and systemic corticosteroids. Routine vaccinations
             are allowed.

         17. Therapy with agents with significant systemic neurotoxic, pancreatotoxic, or
             cytotoxic potential within 3 months of study start, or the need for such therapy is
             expected at the time of enrollment.

         18. Therapy with nephrotoxic agents (aminoglycosides, IV amphotericin, cidofovir, IV
             pentamidine, cisplatin other agents with nephrotoxic potential), adefovir or
             probenecid. These agents must be discontinued at least 30 days prior to starting
             study medications. Brief course of aminoglycosides within 30 days of enrollment may
             be allowed after discussion with Study Chairs.

         19. Concomitant Medications:

               -  The following medications are expressly prohibited during the course of the

                  Voriconazole, St. John's wort or any medications that are contraindicated for
                  concomitant use as described in the current product information packet insert
                  for the ARV therapies used.
