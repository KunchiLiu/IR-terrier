  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a system of nursing telephone support to see if it improves adherence
      to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in at-risk, treatment-experienced people.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is only successful in treating HIV when people take all the
      medications prescribed to them when and how they are instructed. However, a third or more of
      patients on ART are not able to adhere to their medication regimens. Therefore, making sure
      that these patients stay healthy involves making sure they are motivated and informed about
      the importance of adhering to their ART. Nurses can deliver interventions to motivate and
      inform patients through regularly scheduled phone calls. These calls allow nurses to check
      in between clinic visits, are convenient to patients, and are cost efficient. This study
      will test an enhanced telephone support intervention provided by nurses that aims to improve
      ART adherence and treatment outcomes.

      Participation in this study will last 48 weeks, with follow-up lasting 72 weeks.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either care as usual or the enhanced
      telephone support intervention plus care as usual. The telephone support intervention will
      involve phone calls made weekly for the first 8 weeks of the study and then every 2 weeks
      for the next 40 weeks. Nurses will make these calls at a time and place participants choose.
      During the calls, nurses will provide information, motivational enhancement, and
      problem-solving skills.

      Study assessments will take place at study entry and after 12, 24, 48, and 72 weeks.
      Assessments will measure CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, adherence, and illness events.
      Adherence will be measured through questionnaires and an electronic pill cap.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrollment in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) treatment study that is an
             approved A5251 parent or coenrolling partner study

          -  Virologic failure on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), with an HIV-1 genotype
             conducted on or soon after the failure, within 16 weeks prior to entry. HIV-1
             genotype results must be available at entry.

          -  History of prior nonadherence to ART during the past year documented either by
             patient self-report or recorded in the patient's medical record

          -  Most recent HIV-1 RNA value of at least 400 copies/mL, obtained within 90 days prior
             to study entry and measured using any FDA-approved test for quantifying HIV-1 RNA

          -  Initiating a new ART regimen within 3 days after randomization with two or more new
             antiretroviral (ARV) medications to which the participant is expected to be
             susceptible based on HIV-1 genotype, as specified in the parent or coenrolling
             partner study or determined by the site investigator. The regimen must be selected
             for the participant prior to the time of randomization for A5251.

          -  Ability to have CD4+ cell count and plasma HIV-1 RNA assays as a component of the
             parent or coenrolling partner study or per other mechanism. Only HIV-1 RNA at week 48
             and confirmation of virologic failure will be collected by A5251, unless collected by
             the parent or coenrolling partner study per exact A5251 specifications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No regular access to a phone. Candidates without phones may elect to participate by
             calling the HIV nurse specialists using an 800 number, rather than being called by
             the HIV nurse specialist.

          -  Coenrollment in another adherence trial, unless approved by the A5251 study chair

          -  Current incarceration

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would compromise the
             candidate's ability to participate in the study
