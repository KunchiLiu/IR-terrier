      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of LY2603618 in combination with
      pemetrexed and any side effects that might be associated with it along with determining the
      effects of LY2603618 in combination with pemetrexed in patients with advanced or metastatic
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
