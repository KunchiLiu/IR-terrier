    <textblock>
      This research study will evaluate the effects of aspirin and dipyridamole alone and in
      combination on the blood flow in the vessels of the legs. We will examine how these
      medications are able to inhibit the clotting of platelets in the vessels of patients with
      PAD, and thereby affect the blood flow in the legs. Platelets are cells in the blood that
      have the ability to adhere to each other to form clots.

    <textblock>
      Dipyridamole has been reformulated to guarantee systemic bioavailability and steady state
      levels compatible with inhibition of platelet aggregation ex vivo (1). This newly formulated
      dipyridamole has been shown to roughly equal in efficacy to low dose aspirin in the
      secondary prevention of stroke and the drug combination seems roughly additive (2). The
      present study is designed to explore two potential mechanisms which have been linked to
      dipyridamole action on the vessel wall; modulation of vascular eicosanoid generation and
      prevention of oxidant stress (3). We shall address the hypothesis that dipyridamole affects
      these systems in patients with PAD. These individuals have disordered platelet-vascular
      interactions, as reflected by increased generation of thromboxane, an index of platelet
      activation and of prostacyclin, probably a homeostatic response to traumatic and chemical
      stimulation of the endothelium (4,5). Furthermore, we shall assess the functional
      consequences of dipyridamole action, alone and in combination with aspirin compared with
      aspirin alone on local measurements of flow and oxygenation, including exercise tolerance,
      Doppler Ultrasound and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Lipid peroxidation will be
      quantified based on mass spectrometric analysis of the major urinary isoprostane,
      8,12-iso-iPF2a-VI (6,7).
