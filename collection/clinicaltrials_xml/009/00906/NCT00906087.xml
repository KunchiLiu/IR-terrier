  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if one of the genes that can cause glaucoma,
      called myocilin, are associated with larger eye pressure and blood pressure changes in
      sitting and lying down positions without glaucoma drug treatment and with glaucoma drug
      treatment with a combination medication called CosoptÂ® (Merck &amp; Co., Inc.).

    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is an important public health issue, and identifying new markers to improve
      treatment outcomes is a high priority. Progress in Mendelian genetic approaches has led to
      identifying 15 genes and 31 loci (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/); however, since these
      monogenic forms of glaucoma are uncommon, other approaches are needed to identify genetic
      markers that contribute to common risk factors, such as elevated IOP, IOP fluctuation, and
      drug response variation.

      It is well known that IOP varies over a 24-hour period,1-6 but the mechanisms that regulate
      this IOP rhythm are not yet fully known. Drance reported that 84% of normal eyes (N=320
      eyes) had IOP fluctuations of less than 5 mmHg in contrast to only 6% of untreated
      glaucomatous eyes (N=138).7 Drance clearly recognized that IOP factors were more variable in
      eyes with glaucoma. Attention to this IOP fluctuation during glaucoma treatment is important
      because fluctuation leads to progression. The variation in IOP drug response profiles
      measured at selected times over a 24-hour period is related to the mechanism of action of
      these drugs, endogenous circadian rhythms, and glaucoma. We now have the molecular and
      genomic tools to identify potential genetic markers for these variable traits.

      Advancing clinical research to the &quot;translational&quot; level is an important step to integrate
      our ever increasing knowledge base in genomics and proteinomics with clinical trials and
      clinical studies. Given the infrastructure at the University of Michigan with the strength
      in both glaucoma genetics and our resources in the clinic, we are well-positioned to conduct
      such translational research in glaucoma. Although it is known that myocilin (MYOC) mutations
      cause the phenotype of high pressure open-angle glaucoma (OAG), the effect of these MYOC
      mutations in &quot;pre-symptomatic&quot; subjects and patients with early OAG on IOP variation is not
      known.
