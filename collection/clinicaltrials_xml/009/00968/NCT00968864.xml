  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to determine the ability of CD34+ selection and T cell depletion
      using the CliniMACS® device to prevent severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in
      patients receiving a stem cell transplant from an alternative (unrelated and mismatched
      related) donor. The secondary objectives include evaluation of engraftment, immune recovery,
      and post-transplant infections.

      Patients requiring stem cell transplants for either malignant (cancerous) or non-malignant
      disease will be included in the study. The recipients will be grouped into one of two groups
      based on whether the donor is mismatched related (Cohort A) or unrelated (Cohort B). The
      patient will receive a conditioning regimen including chemotherapy drugs and/or total body
      irradiation based on the disease for which the transplant is performed.

    <textblock>
      A major issue in alternative donor (mismatched related and unrelated donor transplantation
      is the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Several clinical trials have shown
      that the use of T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) reduces GVHD in
      alternative donor transplants. The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of CD34
      positive selection and T cell depletion using the CliniMACS® Device as the only GVHD
      prophylaxis to prevent severe acute GVHD in recipients of an alternative donor PBSC
      transplant. Mismatched related donors will match at least 3 of 6 Human leukocyte
      antigens(HLA)(haplocompatible) and unrelated donors will match at least 6 out of 8 HLA
      antigens with the transplant recipient. The conditioning therapy including chemotherapy,
      anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), +/- total body irradiation (TBI) will be based on the
      patient's diagnosis. The transplant recipient will be followed for 5 years after transplant
      for GVHD, engraftment, post-transplant infections, disease relapse, and overall survival. In
      addition, this study will serve as a platform for a companion study of therapy to accelerate
      immune recovery after transplant.
