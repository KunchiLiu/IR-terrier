      This is a Multicenter, Open Label, Phase 2 Study of Sipuleucel-T in Men with Metastatic
      Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).

    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive the investigational product, sipuleucel-T, at approximately 2-week
      intervals, for a total of 3 infusions. The study will evaluate the safety of and magnitude
      of the immune responses to treatment with sipuleucel-T. All subjects will be followed for 30
      days following the last infusion of sipuleucel-T. The study is also available to placebo
      subjects who participated in the D9902B study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For a subject to be eligible for participation in this study, all of the following
        criteria must be satisfied.

          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Metastatic disease.

          -  Castrate resistant prostate cancer.

          -  Castrate level of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL) achieved via medical or surgical
             castration.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Men &gt;= 18 years of age.

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal and liver function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible for participation in this study if any of the following
        criteria apply.

          -  The presence of known lung, liver, or brain metastases.

          -  Evidence of neuroendocrine or small cell features.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &gt; 2.

          -  Prior treatment with 3 infusions of sipuleucel-T (infusions of APC8015F are not
             exclusionary)

          -  Imminent pathologic long-bone fracture (cortical erosion on radiography &gt; 50%) or
             spinal cord compression.

          -  Known malignancies other than prostate cancer that are likely to require treatment
             within six months of registration.

          -  A requirement for systemic immunosuppressive therapy for any reason.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to sipuleucel-T or GM-CSF.

          -  Any infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy or causing fever (temp &gt; 100.5F
             or &gt; 38.1C) within 1 week prior to registration.

          -  Any medical intervention or other condition which, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator or the Dendreon Medical Monitor, could compromise adherence with study
             requirements or otherwise compromise the study's objectives.

        Treatment with any of the following medications or interventions within 28 days of
        registration:

          -  Systemic corticosteroids. Use of inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, and topical
             steroids is acceptable, as is a short course (ie, ≤ 1 day) of corticosteroids to
             prevent a reaction to the IV contrast used for CT scans.

          -  Non-steroidal anti-androgens (eg, bicalutamide, flutamide, or nilutamide).

          -  External beam radiation therapy or major surgery requiring general anesthetic.

          -  Any other systemic therapy for prostate cancer including secondary hormonal
             therapies, such as megestrol acetate (Megace®), diethylstilbestrol (DES), and
             ketoconazole. Medical castration therapy is not exclusionary.

          -  Chemotherapy.

          -  Treatment with any other investigational product.
