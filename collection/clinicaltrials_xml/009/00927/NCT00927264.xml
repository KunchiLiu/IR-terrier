  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS0, also known as secondhand smoke, is the combination of
      smoke given off by the burning end of a tobacco product and the smoke exhaled by the smoker.
      Children exposed to ETS are at an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), ear
      infections, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis and more severe asthma. ETS can also slow the
      growth of children's lungs and can cause them to cough, wheeze and fell breathless. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing-based
      program in reducing ETS exposure and improving lung health among children who are enrolled
      in a Head Start program and whose households include a smoker.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 90% of nonsmoking people in the US are exposed to ETS. More than 50 chemicals
      identified in ETS have been found to cause cancer and exposure has been linked to heart
      disease in adults and SIDS, ear infections and numerous respiratory problems, including
      asthma in children. In 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of Head
      Start-a national program that provides economically disadvantaged children services to
      enhance their social and cognitive development-announced a new initiative to promote
      smoke-free homes for children in Head Start programs. Because Head Start reaches high-risk,
      low-income preschool children, it offers a timely intervention for reducing children's
      exposure to ETS. Head Start also attempts to engage parents, which is an important component
      of reducing household ETS exposure among children. This study will determine the
      effectiveness of a home-delivered, motivational interviewing-based program in reducing ETS
      exposure and improving lung health among children who are enrolled in the Baltimore City
      Head Start program and whose households include a smoker.

      Participation in this study will last 1 year. First, all participating families will be
      visited at home by a study staff person who will attach special filters that will track the
      amount of nicotine in the various rooms of the house. During this initial visit, the
      participating children will undergo weight and height measurements and saliva sampling.
      About a week later, the filters will be collected, a 2nd saliva samples will be taken and
      parents will be interviewed about their family and child's health. Families will then be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups. Both groups will received educational information
      about reducing tobacco smoke exposure. One group will also receive the home-delivered,
      motivational interviewing-based program aimed to reduce ETS. This program will consist of 2
      home visits and 2 phone calls, both led by health counselor who will teach participants how
      to reduce their child's exposure to tobacco smoke. The home visits will occur during Weeks 1
      &amp; 2 and the phone calls will occur during Weeks 3 &amp; 6. Follow-up visits for all
      participating families will occur at Months 3,6 and 12 and will involve repeat filter
      testing, saliva monitoring and interviews.

    <description>The intervention is designed to motivate families to reduce a child's ETS exposure by establishing a complete home and car smoking ban and by considering smoking cessation. Families will receive 2 home visits &amp; 2 telephone session, both with a health counselor. Families will be provided with feedback on air nicotine levels and child salivary cotinine levels. The main target for the intervention will be the primary caregiver of the child because the primary caregiver is ultimately responsible for protecting the child from ETS exposure. Any and all household members may participate in the intervention visits but are not required to do so.</description>
