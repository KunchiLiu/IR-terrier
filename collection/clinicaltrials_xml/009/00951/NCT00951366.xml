  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) Patient Registry is to collect data on
      individuals with neonatal lung disease to better understand the illness and ultimately
      improve their care and survival. The Patient Registry was established in 2008 as a means to
      monitor important trends in the BPD population and to improve understanding, treatment, and
      survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BPD Patient Registry is used by both clinicians and researchers to better understand BPD
      and to improve care of individuals with BPD. Each year the data in the Patient Registry will
      be analyzed and an annual report of BPD health trends will be created. Using this
      information, BPD clinicians can address quality improvement initiatives, and examine
      changing health care issues, including nutritional status, infection control, pulmonary
      treatment and/or metabolic issues rapidly and effectively. The Patient Registry will also
      play an important role in directing clinical care and in the design of clinical research
      studies. Researchers use the registry to help in investigating various aspects of neonatal
      lung diseases like BPD, including medications, diagnostic procedures, and eligibility for
      clinical trials.
