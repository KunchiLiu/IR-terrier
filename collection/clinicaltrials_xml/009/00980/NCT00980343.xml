      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) measured from start of treatment following
      surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity. (Clinical) II. Overall survival. (Clinical) III. Tumor response (PR+CR:
      MacDonald criteria). (Clinical) IV. Determination of in vivo drug effect in recurrent GBM.
      (Correlative studies) V. Determination of in vitro drug effect on CD133+ glioma-derived
      neurospheres. (Correlative studies) VI. Determination of Sonic Hedgehog pathway activation
      in primary vs. recurrent GBM. (Correlative studies)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate clinical outcome (6 mo PFS) with biologic correlates (1-3) above.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 once daily for 7 days before
      surgery.

      Arm II: Patients do not receive treatment before surgery. Beginning within 28 days after
      surgical resection, all patients receive oral Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 once daily on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Fresh and paraffin-embedded tissue samples are collected for correlative laboratory studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.

               -  Surgery must take place Monday-Thursday, with the exception of patients being
                  treated at Cleveland Clinic/University Hospitals: these patients may undergo
                  surgery Monday-Friday

               -  Patients must have a tumor size ≥ 2.5 cm in diameter in two perpendicular planes
                  in order to enable correlative studies

          -  Paraffin embedded tissue must be available from initial surgical resection at
             diagnosis (prior to any treatment)

          -  Patients may have an unlimited number of prior therapy regimens

          -  Patients must have recovered from severe toxicity of prior therapy; the following
             intervals from previous treatments are required to be eligible:

               -  3 months from the completion of radiation

               -  6 weeks from a nitrosourea chemotherapy

               -  3 weeks from a non-nitrosourea chemotherapy

          -  Patients may be on a non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug (non-EIAED); they may
             not be on an EIAED; if previously on an EIAED, patient must be off for at least 14
             days prior to the first dose of GDC-0449

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 60% (i.e. the patient must be
             able to care for himself/herself with occasional help from others)

             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Patients must be able to provide written informed consent

          -  The effects of GDC-0449 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because Hh signal pathway inhibitors are known
             to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must use two forms of
             contraception (i.e., barrier contraception and one other method of contraception)
             prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 12
             months post-treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum pregnancy test
             (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 10-14 days prior to treatment start
             and be required to agree to have the test repeated within 24 hours prior to the first
             dose of GDC-0449 (serum or urine); a pregnancy test (serum or urine) will be
             administered every 4 weeks if their menstrual cycles are regular or every 2 weeks if
             their cycles are irregular while on study within the 24-hour period prior to the
             administration of GDC-0449; a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum
             pregnancy test; prior to dispensing GDC-0449, the investigator must confirm and
             document the patient's use of two contraceptive methods, dates of negative pregnancy
             test, and confirm the patient's understanding of the teratogenic potential of
             GDC-0449; women of childbearing potential are defined as follows:

               -  Patients with regular menses

               -  Patients with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a contraceptive method that
                  precludes withdrawal bleeding

               -  Women who have had a tubal ligation

          -  Women are considered not to be of childbearing potential for the following reasons:

               -  The patient has undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy

               -  The patient is post-menopausal defined by amenorrhea for at least 1 year in a
                  woman &gt; 45 years old

          -  Patients may not be breast-feeding a child

          -  Patients must have a Mini Mental State Exam score of &gt;= 15

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with serious concurrent infection or medical illness, which would jeopardize
             the ability of the patient to receive the treatment outlined in this protocol with
             reasonable safety, are ineligible

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to GDC-0449 or other agents used in the study are
             ineligible

          -  Patients taking medications with narrow therapeutic indices that are metabolized by
             cytochrome P450 (CYP450), including warfarin sodium (Coumadin®) are ineligible

          -  GDC-0449 inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 drug metabolism enzymes in vitro at
             concentrations that may be clinically relevant; therefore, caution should be
             exercised when dosing GDC-0449 concurrently with medications that are substrates of
             CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 and have narrow therapeutic windows; in addition,
             GDC-0449 is a substrate of CYP3A4; however, the in vitro metabolic conversion of
             GDC-0449 is low; effects of CYP inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital,
             phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, St. John's wort, and troglitazone) on clinical
             concentrations of GDC-0449 are unknown; likewise, the effects of strong inhibitors of
             CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone,
             and telithromycin) on GDC-0449 clinical concentrations are unknown, and caution
             should be exercised when dosing GDC-0449 concurrently with inhibitors of CYP3A4

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with
             intestinal absorption are ineligible; patients must be able to swallow capsules

          -  Patients with clinically important history of liver disease, including viral or other
             hepatitis or cirrhosis are ineligible

          -  Patients with a history of uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia or
             hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the institution,
             despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             hypertension, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, are ineligible

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because GDC-0449 is an Hh pathway
             inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with GDC-0449, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with GDC-0449

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with GDC-0449
