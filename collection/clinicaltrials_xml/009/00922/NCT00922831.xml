    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently experience cognitive and emotional
      difficulties. Theses neuropsychiatric symptoms are known to be associated with reduced
      quality of life. However, little is known about the evolution of MS patients'
      neuropsychiatric difficulties and how these neuropsychiatric changes may be related to other
      MS symptoms. The purpose of the present study is to examine MS patients' cognitive and
      emotional status over time as part of standard neuropsychological evaluations in a private
      practice setting. MS patients presenting for neuropsychological evaluation at the MidAmerica
      Neuroscience Institute will be provided with the option of participating in thorough
      evaluation of their cognitive and affective MS symptoms. They will then be followed
      clinically and receive re-evaluation over a period of 3 years on a yearly basis. It is hoped
      that this study will help us obtain a better understanding of the factors associated with
      worsening cognition in MS. A greater understanding of the factors associated with cognitive
      and affective decline in MS help could lead to the early identification and treatment of
      at-risk patients.
