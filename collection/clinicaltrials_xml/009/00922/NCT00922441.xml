      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of
      Fimasartan (BR-A-657•K) during 24 hours by dose in patients with mild to moderate essential
      hypertension.

    <textblock>
      Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K), a selective blocker of AT1 receptor subtype, showed the rapid and
      potent antihypertensive effect in many hypertensive models. Phase I study,
      Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) 20mg ~ 480mg single dosing with healthy subjects, demonstrated that
      the Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) was very safe and well tolerated. Another phase I study,
      Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) 120mg and 360mg dosing for 7 days, also showed that
      Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) was safe and tolerable though one temporal adverse event was observed
      in high dose.

      A Randomized, Double-blind, Valsartan-referenced, Parallel Grouped, Therapeutic Exploratory
      Clinical Study to Evaluate the Antihypertensive Efficacy of Fimasartan(BR-A-657•K) during
      24hoursby dose in Patients with Mild to Moderate Essential Hypertension.

      Approximately 90 patients will be enrolled over 12 months in 5 centers nationwide.

      After 2 weeks of placebo run-in period, all subjects will be randomized into one of the
      following 3 groups. Subjects will take test/control drug for 8 weeks of treatment period.

      If subjects take any antihypertensive medications before screening, the subjects will have 1
      week of wash-out period.

      Group I : Fimasartan 60mg group. Group II : Fimasartan 120mg group Group III : Valsartan
      80mg group
