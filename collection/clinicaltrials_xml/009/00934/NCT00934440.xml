      In this study, the investigator will assess progression-free and overall survival of
      patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with 5-azacitidine in combination with
      bevacizumab. Patients will continue on treatment until either disease progression or
      development of other criteria for withdrawal.

    <description>All patients in phase I and II will receive bevacizumab at the standard dose of 10mg/kg IV every two weeks. The first dose should be infused over 90 minutes. If no adverse reactions occur, the second dose of bevacizumab should be given over a minimum of 60 minutes. If no adverse event occurs, third and subsequent doses should be administered over a minimum of 30 minutes.
For phase I:
Patients will receive 5-azacitidine given subcutaneously (SQ) at the following dose levels:
Dose level 1: 35 mg/m2/day for 7 days. Dose level 2: 55 mg/m2/day for 7 days. Dose level 3: 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days.
For phase IIa:
5-azacitidine SQ to be given days 1-7 and repeated every 28 days (using the MTD). Bevacizumab will be 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks.</description>

               -  Platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times ULN

               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 times ULN

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 7 days prior to start of treatment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for duration of study. Men
             should use adequate birth control for at least 3 months after the last administration
             of Bevacizumab.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign written informed consent. A signed
             informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures.

          -  Patients not on anticoagulation must have an INR &lt; 1.5 or a PT/PTT within normal
             limits. Patients receiving anti-coagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin
             or heparin may be allowed to participate. For patients on warfarin, the INR should be
             measured prior to initiation of treatment and monitored at least weekly, or as
             defined by the local standard of care, until INR is stable.

          -  Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma which is
             metastatic (M1). Patients with unresectable primary tumors (but MO) are eligible.

          -  Must have measurable disease, defined as at least 1 lesion that can be accurately
             measured in at least 1 dimension. Soft tissue disease that has been radiated in the 2
             months prior to registration is not assessable as measurable disease. Soft tissue
             disease within a prior radiation field must have progressed to be considered
             assessable. X-rays, scans or physical examinations used for tumor measurement must
             have been completed within 28 days prior to registration. X-rays, scans or physical
             examinations for non-measurable disease must have been completed within 42 days prior
             to registration.

          -  Patients with metastatic disease who have a resectable primary tumor and deemed a
             surgical candidate may have undergone resection and have recovered from surgery. At
             least 28 days must have elapsed since surgery and must have recovered from any
             adverse effects of surgery.

          -  Urine protein must be screened by urine analysis for Urine Protein Creatinine (UPC)
             ratio. For UPC ratio &gt; 0.5, 24-hour urine protein must be obtained and the level must
             be &lt; 1,000mg for patient enrollment. The urine protein used to calculate the UPC
             ratio must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration. NOTE: UPC ratio of spot
             urine is an estimation of the 24-hour urine protein excretion - a UPC ratio of 1 is
             roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1gm. UPC ratio is calculated using
             one of the following formulas: [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein
             and creatinine are reported in mg/dL

          -  May have received prior immunotherapy with either interferon (IFN) and/or
             Interleukin-2 (IL-2) or the combination of IFN/IL2 or prior chemotherapy (ie,
             gemcitabine and capecitabine).

          -  Must have failed at least 1 prior biologic agent (sunitinib, sorafenib, or
             temsorlimus). No limit on the number of prior therapies.

          -  At least 14 days must have elapsed since the last treatment. Must have recovered from
             any adverse effects of prior therapy.

          -  May have received prior radiation therapy. At least 21 days must have elapsed since
             completion of prior radiation therapy. Must have recovered from all associated
             toxicities at the time of registration.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women not eligible because of potential teratogenic side effects
             of 5-azacitidine and bevacizumab on the developing fetus or nursing infant. Women and
             men of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive
             method.

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to 5-azacitidine or bevacizumab are not eligible.

          -  Involvement in correlative studies must be offered to all patients but is not
             required.

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             Stage I or II cancer from which patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which patient has been disease-free for 2 years.

          -  Must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign and give
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

             angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or new onset angina (began within the last 3
             months) or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months.

          -  Known brain metastasis. Patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a CT
             scan/MRI of brain to exclude brain metastasis.

          -  Patients who have received prior bevacizumab are eligible for phase I portion of
             study but ineligible for phase II study.

          -  Cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic
             pressure &gt; 90 mmHg, despite optimal medical management.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic Hepatitis B or C.

          -  Active clinically serious infection &gt; CTCAE Grade 2.
