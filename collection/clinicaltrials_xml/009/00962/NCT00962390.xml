  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase 2a, randomized, double blind, multicenter, placebo controlled, parallel
      group, proof of concept study comparing the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of S-equol
      to placebo in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The study objective is to examine
      a dose response of 3 dose levels of S equol versus placebo on prostate specific antigen
      concentrations in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The safety of S-equol will be
      evaluated during the study.
