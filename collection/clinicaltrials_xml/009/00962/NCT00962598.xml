    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a 10-week Omega-3 Fatty Acid
      treatment phase on brain chemistry of adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) using
      proton magnetic resonance imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study rests on a confluence of findings showing that: 1) Major depressive disorder
      (MDD), is a major public health concern that often emerges in adolescence; which entails 2)
      pathophysiological abnormalities in fronto-striatal structures resulting in death and
      atrophy of glia and neurons; 3) omega-3 fatty acids (FA) effects on brain function in
      adolescent MDD can be assessed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS); and, 4)
      it is critical that commonly used complementary and alternative medicines such as omega-3FA
      that have face validity be tested for their neurobiological effect in MDD.

      Using 1H MRSI, this study examines the effects of Omega-3FA on striatal and anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) concentrations of the neurocellular biomarkers total choline (tCho),
      total creatine (tCr), and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA, ACC only) in adolescent MDD. Hypotheses
      are: 1) relative to placebo, omega-3FA treatment will result in significant reductions of
      striatal and ACC tCho and tCr concentrations, and increased ACC GABA; 2: Regardless of
      treatment condition (placebo or Omega-3FA), MDD adolescents who are improved at the end of
      10-week treatment will exhibit a significant decrease in striatal and ACC tCho and tCr
      concentrations, and increases in ACC GABA relative to unimproved adolescents.

    <description>The study medication will consist of combined EPA/DHA with a ratio of 2:1. Dosage will be titrated based on clinical response and side effects. The initial dose will be 1.2g/d. This will be increased gradually by 0.6 per 2 weeks to a possible maximum daily dose of 3.6 g/d. Patients will have to remain on a dose for 2 weeks to provide the opportunity to assess clinical response at any one dose. The total duration of the intervention will be 10 weeks.</description>
