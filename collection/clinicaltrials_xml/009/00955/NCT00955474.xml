  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of Seroquel
      monotherapy for the treatment of Major Depression with Psychotic features with Seroquel plus
      Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor.

      The proposed study is designed to investigate the non-inferiority of treatment of PsyD using
      monotherapy with quetiapine XR versus combination treatment using quetiapine XR and an SSRI
      (sertraline or citalopram or escitalopram) during the acute phase of treatment. The primary
      outcome measures will be the change rates of symptoms of depression (as measured on the
      Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D-17] and psychosis (as measured on the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] Positive Symptoms Subscale).

      The secondary aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      quetiapine XR and SSRIs in patients with the diagnosis of PsyD. Metabolic factors including
      fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and fasting lipids (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and
      triglycerides) will be obtained at screen and at the 8-week endpoint of the study to assess
      the impact of treatment on the development of risk factors for metabolic syndrome. Measures
      of cognitive function (MGH Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire and RBANS) (Fava
      et al. 2006; Randolph et al. 1998) will be obtained at screen and the 8-week endpoint of the
      study to assess the impact of treatment on cognitive function.
