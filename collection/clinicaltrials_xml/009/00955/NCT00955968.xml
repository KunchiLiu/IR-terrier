      This study is a randomized strategy trial conducted among women who received highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during pregnancy for purposes of prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV but do not otherwise meet criteria to initiate
      HAART for their own health. The study is designed to determine whether continuation of HAART
      after delivery or other pregnancy outcome reduces morbidity and mortality compared to
      discontinuation and re-initiation of HAART according to current standards of care.
