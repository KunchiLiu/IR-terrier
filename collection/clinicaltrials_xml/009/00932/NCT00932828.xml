    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is known to cause severe anaphylactic reactions.The goal of this proposal is
      to produce a new treatment that would benefit young subjects who have recently been
      diagnosed with peanut allergy by lowering the risk of anaphylactic reactions
      (desensitization), and changing the peanut-specific immune response in subjects who have
      peanut allergy (tolerance).

    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is known to cause severe anaphylactic reactions. Compared with other food
      allergies, it tends to be more persistent and its prevalence seems to be rising. Currently,
      there is no proven treatment other than strict avoidance. We are attempting to decrease the
      risk of anaphylaxis on accidental ingestion by desensitizing subjects to peanut using peanut
      mucosal immunotherapy (PMIT). We are also studying the effect of PMIT on the peanut-specific
      immune response to determine if tolerance to peanut protein will develop. Based on our
      preliminary work and recent studies supporting the importance of early oral exposure in
      tolerance induction, we propose that early treatment of peanut allergy with PMIT will be
      safe and effective. Children ages 9 to 36 months with peanut allergy will be randomized to
      receive high or low dose PMIT using peanut flour. Peanut-allergic subjects receiving no
      intervention will serve as controls. Subjects will undergo desensitization on the first day
      and then increase the doses gradually to a maintenance dose. Doses will be taken daily at
      home except for dose increases which will be done on the research unit. Subjects will
      undergo a double-blinded, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) if challenge criteria
      are met. Subjects passing the first challenge will stop PMIT and repeat the DBPCFC to assess
      tolerance. Outcome variables of interest include response to oral food challenges (OFC),
      skin prick testing, peanut specific serum immunoglobin E (IgE), immunoglobin G (IgG), and
      immunoglobin G4 (IgG4) and stool immunoglobin A (IgA), T and B cell responses, quality of
      life, and adverse events. These longitudinal results will be compared between high and low
      dose PMIT groups and controls using appropriate statistical analysis.
