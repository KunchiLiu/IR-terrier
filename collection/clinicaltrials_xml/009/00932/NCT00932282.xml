  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of anti-IgE treatment will
      make peanut oral immunotherapy safer, more tolerable, and more effective in treating peanut
      allergy.

      The goal of this proposal is to produce a new treatment that would benefit subjects who have
      peanut allergy by lowering the risk of anaphylactic reactions (desensitization), and
      changing the peanut-specific immune response in subjects who have peanut allergy
      (tolerance). This project is designed to study if peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) will
      desensitize subjects with peanut hypersensitivity by regulating their oral and systemic
      immune reactivity and cause long-term tolerance. This study will augment other ongoing
      studies by looking at whether anti-IgE therapy can reduce side effects and allow for an
      accelerated build up phase. Peanut allergic patients greater than 12 years old will undergo
      omalizumab (anti-IgE) treatment for 4 months prior to peanut OIT, and they will continue
      omalizumab until one month after maintenance therapy. Each subject will have an initial
      desensitization phase over 2 days to a goal of 950 mg of peanut powder followed by a build
      up phase over 4 months to goal maintenance dose of 8000 mg peanut powder. They will be
      randomized to continue maintenance for 12 or 24 months. They will then have an oral food
      challenge (OFC) immediately after stopping peanut OIT to test for desensitization. Four
      weeks later, off OIT, another food challenge will be done to assess tolerance. Outcome
      variables of interest include results of the OFCs, pre and post skin tests, CAP-FEIA values
      and basophil studies. These results will be compared between the starting point and the
      patient at the end of the study using appropriate statistical analysis.

    <description>Randomized subjects who will stay on the maintenance dose of oral peanut immunotherapy (PnOIT) for 12 months.
The study has 4 phases: anti-IgE therapy before immunotherapy (Omalizumab), an initial desensitization day(s), a buildup period, and a daily home maintenance phase with a final dose of 8000mg peanut flour (~50% peanut protein). Then all subjects will be randomized to an additional 1 or 2 years (12 or 24 months) of maintenance OIT. An OFC will be performed at the end of the long-term maintenance in all groups.</description>
