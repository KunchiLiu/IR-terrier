      The objective of this study is to compare the mechanism of action between adalimumab and
      methotrexate in subjects with psoriasis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both methotrexate and adalimumab are FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of moderate to
      severe psoriasis. The two treatments, methotrexate and adalimumab, both show efficacy for
      psoriasis, however their profiles differ. In the CHAMPION Study, more adalimumab-treated,
      moderate to severe psoriasis patients achieved a PASI 75 after 16 weeks compared to those
      treated with methotrexate (80% vs. 36%). The reason for this difference is poorly
      understood. No direct comparative mechanism of action studies in psoriasis patients between
      methotrexate and adalimumab (or any tumor necrosis factor blocker) has been reported.

      With etanercept, another tumor necrosis factor blocker, the in vivo mechanism has been
      studied with some scientific rigor. These studies demonstrate that etanercept down regulates
      multiple pro-inflammatory pathways (as shown in Table 1 of the protocol).

      To date, there are no similar studies with adalimumab or methotrexate.

      In order to understand the molecular and cellular basis for the differential clinical
      efficacy of adalimumab and methotrexate, it is essential to compare their mechanisms of
      action in psoriatic plaques. Biopsies will be performed, and we will study biomarkers in
      this proposal with immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and gene
      arrays.

    <description>A single, long-term follow-up visit will be done for all available subjects for additional pharmacogenetic analysis. The goal in collecting DNA from psoriasis patients is to determine if individual subjects have gene variants associated with increased incidence of psoriasis. The investigators plan on analyzing variants using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis by high-throughput DNA sequencing. This patient genetic information may allow us to correctly interpret data collected about gene expression levels in affected or non-affected skin. Additionally genetic typing may lead to cogent personalized health care (PHC) strategies for the identification of psoriasis drug responders/non-responders, patients who achieve durable disease remission post-treatment, and/or pharmacodynamic markers, as examples.</description>

    <description>Patients will be dosed according to the CHAMPION study in single weekly doses of methotrexate: 7.5mg at week 0, 10mg at week two, and 15mg at week 4 for all patients. For each subject if the PASI did not decrease by at least 50% from baseline (PASI-50) at week 8, dosing will be increased to 20mg per week; the dose will be maintained at 15mg per week if PASI-50 was achieved at week 8. If PASI-50 was not achieved at week 12, dosing will be increased to 25mg per week; the dose will be maintained at 20mg per week if the PASI-50 was achieved at week 12. All patients on methotrexate will also receive a dietary supplement of oral folate (5mg per week). Methotrexate-treated patients will then receive 16 weeks of adalimumab at the end of study.</description>
