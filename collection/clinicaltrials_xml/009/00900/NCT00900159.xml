      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of eszopiclone on daytime sleep and
      overnight wakefulness in shift workers.

      The current study seeks to extend the currently available treatments for SWSD by addressing
      the putative root cause of the problem—the inability of night-shift workers with or without
      SWSD— to obtain adequate daytime sleep in the face of the circadian drive for alertness that
      increases across the biological day. Even healthy, young subjects who are sleep-deprived
      overnight exhibit daytime sleep marked by frequent awakenings and low sleep efficiency, less
      slow-wave sleep, and altered sleep architecture, e.g. earlier predominance of REM sleep.
      Many night-workers routinely report 3-6 hours of habitual sleep duration for daytime sleep.
      Pharmacological interventions to decrease awakenings and improve total sleep time during
      daytime sleep could improve subsequent alertness during a night shift. Improving the
      wakefulness of night-shift workers over the nighttime could result in substantial benefits
      for the individual workers, improve workplace productivity and safety, and improve public
      health.
