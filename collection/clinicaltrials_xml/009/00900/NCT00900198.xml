  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      -Patients who are being evaluated or are on research protocols at the NIH Clinical Center or
      at participating sites will be entered onto this screening and tissue procurement protocol
      for collection of tissue specimens.

      Objectives:

      -To obtain samples for research purposes from tests performed for clinical indications or
      research indications on other research protocols, and to obtain samples for research
      purposes from non-surgical procedures, performed for the sole purpose of obtaining samples
      for this protocol.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients who are being evaluated for and/or treated on protocols within the NIH Clinical
      Center or at participating sites.

      Design:

        -  Specimens for research purposes, as outlined in this protocol, will be obtained from
           tests and procedures that are done as required by the primary research protocols that a
           given patient is enrolled in.

        -  These procedures may include, but are not limited to, laboratory tests on blood, CSF,
           urine or other specimens; and needle biopsies.

        -  Given the risks associated with any procedure, the procedure will be discussed in
           detail with the patients, including the side effects, prior to obtaining a separate
           consent for each procedure.

        -  Tissues and biological fluids to be procured may include but are not limited to blood,
           serum, urine, tumor tissue, normal tissue, pleural fluid, CSF, saliva, bronchial
           alveolar lavage (BAL), and bone marrow. These specimens will be stored without patient
           identifiers and used to perform only those research studies that are outlined in this
           protocol. Patients can opt to donate samples to create preclinical models to study
           tumor biology and genetics, and to develop new therapies for cancer.

      Once a patient is taken off study, he or she may be re-consented and enrolled at a later
      time to obtain another research specimen as part of this protocol.

      Background:

      -Patients who are being evaluated and/or treated at the NIH Clinical Center or participating
      sites will be entered onto this tissue procurement protocol for collection of tissue
      specimens.

      Objectives:

        -  To obtain samples for research purposes from tests performed for clinical &amp; research
           indications on other research protocols.

        -  To obtain samples for research purposes from non-surgical procedures, such as
           percutaneous biopsies, performed for the sole purpose of obtaining tissue specimens or
           biological fluids for this protocol.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients who are being evaluated for and/or treated for cancer at the NIH Clinical Center
      or at participating sites.

      Design:

        -  This is a multicenter tissue procurement protocol with NCI as the coordinating center.

        -  Specimens for research purposes, as outlined in this protocol, will be obtained from
           tests and procedures that are done as required by the primary research protocols that a
           given patient is enrolled in.

        -  Non-surgical procedures, such as percutaneous biopsies, may also be performed for the
           sole purpose of obtaining tissue specimens or biological fluids for this protocol.

        -  Given the risks associated with any invasive procedure, such as tumor biopsy, the
           procedure will be discussed in detail with the patients, including the side effects,
           prior to obtaining a separate consent for each procedure. A separate consent will not
           be signed prior to obtaining samples by minimally invasive measures, such as
           venipuncture.

        -  Tissues and biological fluids to be procured may include but are not limited to blood,
           serum, urine, tumor tissue, normal tissue, pleural fluid, CSF, saliva, bronchial
           alveolar lavage (BAL), circulating tumor cells, hair follicles, and bone marrow. These
           specimens will be stored with unique identifier and used to perform only those research
           studies that are outlined in this protocol.

        -  This study has two separate consent forms at the NIH: patients at the NIH Clinical
           Center can opt to donate their samples for ongoing research on assay development and
           studying pathways. In addition, patients can opt to donate samples to create
           preclinical models to study tumor biology and genetics, and to develop new therapies
           for cancer. Patients enrolled onto this protocol in participating sites will be
           donating specimens (tumor, blood) for the creation of preclinical models to study tumor
           biology and genetics, and to develop new therapies for cancer.

        -  Patients may remain on study for the duration of their consent.
