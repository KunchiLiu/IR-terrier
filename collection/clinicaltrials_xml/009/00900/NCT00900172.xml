      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related
      to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood and tissue samples from patients with
      locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with
      bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine whether germline polymorphisms (DNA) of genes involved in DNA repair
           (e.g., XPD, ERCC-1, and others) and angiogenesis (e.g., vascular endothelial growth
           factor [VEGF], interleukin-8, CXCR2, adrenomedullin, leptin, and others) are associated
           with toxicity and clinical outcome in patients with non-small cell lung cancer enrolled
           on protocol ECOG-4599.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples previously obtained from patients on protocol ECOG-4599 are analyzed
      for the association of germline variations of genes involved in DNA repair (XPD and ERCC1),
      angiogenesis (VEGF and IL-8), and clinical outcome (overall survival, response,
      progression-free survival, and toxicity).

      Tumor cells are collected from paraffin-embedded tissue using laser-capture microdissection
      and normal tissue is collected from the specimen. Polymorphisms in ERCC-1, XRCC-1, XRCC-3,
      GST-P1, TGF-Î², and IL-8CXCR are assessed using Taqman assays.
