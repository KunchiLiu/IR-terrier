  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) related to pregnancy is a common reason to sick leave during
      pregnancy. Low back pain and PGP affects about 50% of women during pregnancy. Most of the
      women recover, however about 10% of the women still have complaints after birth. Most
      patients have positive effect from conservative treatment, but unfortunately some do still
      have much pain despite intensive conservative rehabilitation. Surgery has been tried on
      these women with various results. Surgical treatment is controversial and there is a lack of
      documentation. The investigators will operate 20 patients with arthrodesis to the sacroiliac
      joint and symphysis. Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) will be used to evaluate the joint
      movement in different part of the process.

      Hypothesis: Severe pelvic girdle pain is caused by pelvic joint instability in some cases
      and surgically fixation of the affected joints can help these women to get back to a normal
      life.

    <description>Standard surgical procedures will be used. When the patient has isolated pain in the symphysis isolated fixation will be performed. A 2x2 cm large bone block will be removed and replaced with spongy bone. For fixation the Matta-plate will be applied.
To the sacroiliac joint we use an anterior approach. A 2x1,5 cm large bone block will be removed and replaced with spongy bone from the iliac crest. For joint fixation we either use 2 plates or sacroiliac screws. The same procedure will be used on the other side in the cases with bilateral symptoms. Only one side will be operated at a time. After one year it will be decided if it's necessary to perform contralateral surgery.</description>
