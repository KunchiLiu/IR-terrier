    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to examine endoxifen and 4-OH-Tam as a function of the tamoxifen dose
      in patients with a genetic CYP2D6 polymorphism. The investigators also plan to investigate
      other genetic variations in the metabolism of tamoxifen.

      Endocrine therapy has proven to be an extremely effective therapy in breast cancer. For
      women with hormone-receptor-positive tumors, tamoxifen given for as little as two years
      results in a statistically significant recurrence and survival benefit. The benefits
      increase as the duration of treatment increase, up to 5 years, so that among women treated
      for five years, tamoxifen can result in up to a 46 percent annual reduction in the
      recurrence rate and up to a 28 percent annual reduction in the death rate. This means that
      about half of the recurrences and more than one fourth of the deaths each year are prevented
      by tamoxifen treatment. However, despite initial successful responses, many patients on
      tamoxifen relapse and die from progressive disease. Consequently, tamoxifen resistance
      remains a major clinical problem in the management of breast cancer.

      Tamoxifen is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to the more potent metabolites
      4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OH-TAM) and 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen (endoxifen). Variations in
      the metabolic capacity of this enzyme have shown to be an independent predictor of breast
      cancer relapse and death. To date, studies have not correlated tamoxifen doses to CYP2D6
      genotype status or associated tamoxifen doses to endoxifen and 4-OH-tamoxifen.

      We plan to examine endoxifen and 4-OH-Tam as a function of the tamoxifen dose in patients
      with a genetic CYP2D6 polymorphism. We also plan to investigate other genetic variations in
      the metabolism of tamoxifen. The possible identification of gene variants that alter
      tamoxifen's metabolism may improve initial dose selection and therefore optimize treatment
      outcome in the future.

      In addition to examining polymorphisms in CYP2D6, we will examine other genes that may
      influence the metabolism of medications.
