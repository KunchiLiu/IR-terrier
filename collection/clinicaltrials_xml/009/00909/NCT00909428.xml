      Evaluating the effect of VesicareR 10 mg (Solifenacin, Astellas Inc) QD, on the urgency
      level as recorded by the filling phase of urodynamic testing, in patients with overactive
      bladder. In this pilot study, 10 patients with overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) symptoms
      and who have previously undergone urodynamic testing which demonstrated detrusor
      overactivity and who are not currently receiving an anticholinergic drug, will be recruited
      from our clinic. Patients will take Vesicare 10 mg daily for 1 month, then undergo repeat
      urodynamic testing for repeat evaluation of the urgency level during the filling phase.

             questionnaire, already completed as part of routine clinical care.

          -  Demonstrated detrusor overactivity with or without incontinence during urodynamic
             testing, during routine clinical care.

          -  Are able to consent and fill out study documents, complete repeated urodynamic
             testing and follow up in 4 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have been treated with any anticholinergic medication in the previous month.

          -  Have an elevated post -void residual volume as determined during their routine
             clinical care.

          -  Have had a urinary tract infection in the last month, as determined by history.

          -  Have untreated narrow angle glaucoma, by patient history.
