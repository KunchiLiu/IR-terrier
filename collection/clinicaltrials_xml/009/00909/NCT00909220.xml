      This study will determine how people with depression differ from healthy people in brain
      activity and interpreting emotions, both before and after receiving a psychotherapy
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder is a serious form of depression that may be treated with
      psychotherapy. However, up to 40% of adults with depression do not show reduced symptoms
      when treated with cognitive therapy or behavioral activation (BA), two common forms of
      psychotherapy. Certain indicators are generally linked with a successful outcome of
      psychotherapy—demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidity, and treatment
      adherence—but no factors reliably predict outcomes of psychotherapy in individuals. This
      study will test whether two characteristics related to the way people process emotions,
      affective asymmetry and affective reactivity, can predict whether people with depression
      will improve with BA therapy.

      Both depressed and healthy participants will be recruited for this study. Participation in
      this study will last 31 weeks. All participants will complete baseline assessments at Weeks
      1 and 2. Depressed participants will then begin receiving 16 weekly sessions of BA therapy.
      All participants will be assessed again after 8, 16, 17, and 28 weeks. Assessments will
      include the following: a urine toxicology screening; interviews on mental and physical
      health, family and childhood experiences, and current mood and functioning; computer tasks;
      recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) activity; recordings of reaction to a startle
      probe; recordings of electromyography (EMG) activity; recordings of electrodermal activity
      (EDA); and measurement of blood pressure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy participants should have no lifetime history of psychiatric disorder

          -  Depressed participants should have a current diagnosis of major depressive disorder,
             as defined by the DSM-IV

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of bipolar affective disorder

          -  History of psychosis

          -  Current non-psychotic Axis I disorder, if it constitutes the predominant aspect of
             the clinical presentation and immediately requires treatment other than that offered
             in the study

          -  History of substance dependence within the past 6 months

          -  Antisocial, borderline, schizotypal, or schizoid personality disorders

          -  Evidence of any medical disorder or condition that could cause depression or preclude
             the use of study treatments

          -  Current treatment with catecholaminergic antihypertensive medication, such as
             reserpine, beta-blockers, clonidine, and alphamethyldopa

          -  Current use of antidepressant medication

          -  Clear indication of secondary gain

          -  Current suicide risk sufficient to preclude treatment on an outpatient basis

          -  Severe, unstable concurrent psychiatric conditions likely to require hospitalization
             within 6 months of study entry

          -  Already receiving a targeted psychotherapy aimed at depression
