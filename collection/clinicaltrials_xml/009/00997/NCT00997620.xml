    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that treating hay fever patients who had daytime sleepiness and slowed
      thinking because of the hay fever will improve when treated with an effective anti-hay fever
      medication, an intranasal steroid, that is will have less daytime sleepiness and demonstrate
      better thinking.

      In this study of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis we will monitor daytime sleepiness
      as measured by validated daytime sleep score (Eppworth Daytime Sleepiness Scale) and
      cognitive performance weekly as measured by a validated test of cognitive performance
      (TOVA). The treatment group with intervention of fluticasone furoate two sprays in each
      nostril once daily will be compared to a placebo treated group of similar subjects with
      seasonal allergic rhinitis.
