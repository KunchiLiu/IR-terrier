      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of oral voriconazole to topical
      treatment regimens results in lower rates of perforation in severe fungal corneal ulcers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fungal corneal ulcers tend to have very poor outcomes with commonly used treatments. There
      has only been a single randomized trial of anti-fungal therapy for mycotic keratitis, and no
      new ocular anti-fungal medications have been approved by the FDA since the 1960s. The
      triazole voriconazole has recently become the treatment of choice for systemic fungal
      infections such as pulmonary aspergillosis. The use of topical ophthalmic preparations of
      voriconazole has been described in numerous case reports, however there has been no
      systematic attempt to determine whether it is more or less clinically effective than
      natamycin. Additionally, there have been many case reports of the use of oral voriconazole
      in the treatment of fungal corneal ulcers, however there has been no systematic attempt to
      determine if it improves outcomes in severe ulcers.

      This study is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial to determine if the use
      of oral voriconazole in severe ulcers reduces the rate of perforations. 240 fungal corneal
      ulcers with baseline visual acuity worse than 6/120 presenting to the Aravind Eye Hospitals
      and the UCSF Proctor Foundation will be randomized to receive oral voriconazole plus topical
      voriconazole and topical natamycin, or oral placebo plus topical voriconazole and topical
      natamycin. The primary outcome is the rate of perforation over the three month follow-up
      period.
