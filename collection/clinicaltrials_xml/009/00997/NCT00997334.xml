  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess the frequency of the development of
      mutations (especially EGFR mutations) that lead to resistance to erlotinib in people with
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The investigators will also be looking to see if the
      participant's NSCLC improves with erlotinib and why it may eventually stop responding to
      erlotinib.

      -  Participants will take erlotinib orally once a day. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days.

        -  While on the study, participants will be required to be seen in the clinic on Day 1 of
           each treatment cycle. During these visit, the following tests and procedures will be
           done: physical exam and blood tests. They will also return for blood work during Cyle 1
           Day 8.

        -  At the end of every two cycles an assessment of the participant's tumor will be done by
           CT and/or MRI (this is part of regular cancer care) as well as the following: Urine
           test and blood tests.

        -  At the end of study treatment the following procedures will be done: blood tests,
           assessment of the tumor by CT and/or MRI and a new biopsy of the tumor or removal of
           fluid containing tumor cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer, stage IV or
             IIIB with a malignant pleural or pericardial effusion. Patients with stage I or II
             non-small cell lung cancer who have undergone surgical resection but who subsequently
             relapse with metastatic disease or a malignant pleural effusion are also eligible.

          -  Documentation of a sensitizing mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. In
             addition, there must be a sufficient tissue for analysis of KRAS mutations and MET
             amplification.

          -  At least one measurable or evaluable site of disease as defined by revised RECIST
             (version 1.1) criteria.

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  No more than one prior systemic therapy regimen for advanced non-small cell lung
             cancer. Chemotherapy delivered as part of concurrent chemoradiation will also count
             as a prior systemic therapy regimen. Adjuvant therapy for resected NSCLC will not
             count towards this total as long as it was completed at least 6 months prior to
             enrollment and did not include therapy with an EGFR-targeted agent. Adjuvant therapy
             completed less than 6 months prior to the time of screening will count as a prior
             regimen.

          -  3 or more weeks since prior major surgery

          -  2 or more weeks since prior radiation

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 8 weeks

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function

          -  Willingness to undergo repeat tumor biopsy at the time of disease progression.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Untreated and/or uncontrolled central nervous system metastases. Patients with prior
             brain metastases must have had definitive treatment (radiation or surgery) and must
             be clinically stable off steroids for at least 1 week prior to enrollment.

          -  More than one prior systemic chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. ,
             Chemotherapy delivered as part of concurrent chemoradiation will also count as a
             prior systemic therapy regimen. Adjuvant therapy for resected NSCLC willnot count
             towards this total as long as it was completed at least 6 months prior to enrollment
             and did not include therapy with an EGFR-targeted agent. Adjuvant therapy completed
             less than 6 months prior to the time of screening will count as a prior regimen.

          -  Prior exposure to erlotinib or other treatments targeting the HER family axis.

          -  Active malignancies within the past 3 years, except for adequately treated carcinoma

          -  Concurrent use of warfarin. Patients must be off warfarin for at least one week prior
             to initiation of erlotinib. Other non-warfarin anticoagulants are permitted.

          -  Patients who require ongoing concomitant use of one of the strong inhibitors/inducers
             of CYP3A4.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of study
