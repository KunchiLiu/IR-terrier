      This study is for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have not been treated with
      chemotherapy for their cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out if Capecitabine and
      Sunitinib can be used together to improve progression-free survival in colorectal cancer.

      All patients will take two medicines (Sunitinib and Capecitabine) by mouth every day until
      their cancer gets worse.

      This is a single-center, open-label, one-arm study. Patients will be stratified by prior
      adjuvant therapy and ECOG performance status at study entry.

      In this study, we propose to obtain PET scans at baseline, 2 weeks, 8 weeks and 24 weeks
      from the initiation of treatment. Response at 2 weeks, 8 weeks and 24 weeks will be
      correlated to progression-free survival, overall survival and response according to RECIST
      criteria.

      We will collect plasma and urine samples from enrolled patients before and four weeks after
      sunitinib treatment. The samples will be analyzed and results correlated with patient
      clinical outcomes in order to explore the underlying mechanism of sunitinib induced
      hypertension.
