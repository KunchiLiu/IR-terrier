  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to assess the safety of GSK's H1N1 vaccine in real life
      conditions as soon as the vaccine is used, in a mass vaccination programme, and with a
      system for rapid generation, communication and evaluation of safety data.

      This study is a commitment to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), as part of
      GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' (GSK Biologicals') risk management plan for pandemic influenza
      vaccination.
