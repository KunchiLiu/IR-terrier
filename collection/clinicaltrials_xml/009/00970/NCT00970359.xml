  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the drug AZD6244 can improve the radioactive
      iodine uptake by the patient's metastatic thyroid cancer. The investigator will also be
      testing the tumor specimen taken at the time of your surgery for specific genetic changes to
      see if one of them in particular (the BRAF oncogene) makes your cancer more likely to become
      sensitive to radioactive iodine after treatment with the drug.

      The investigators want to find out if AZD6244 helps to increase the entry of radioactive
      iodine into thyroid cancer cells that have spread and are resistant to radioactive iodine
      therapy, especially if they have the BRAF mutation. To measure how much iodine can enter
      your cancer, the investigators will use iodine-124, a different form of radioactive iodine.
      Iodine-124 allows the investigators to measure precisely how much radioactivity can enter
      the cancer cells, whereas iodine-131 does not. The process of scanning with iodine-124 is
      called &quot;lesional dosimetry&quot;. Iodine-124 is an investigational agent approved by the FDA
      (Food and Drug Administration) for use in this research study.

    <description>This is a pilot study involving patients with RAI-refractory metastatic thyroid cancer. Patients meeting inclusion criteria will have their tumor genotyped for BRAF mutational status. Lesional dosimetry will be performed at baseline using 124I-PET, and treatment with the selective MEK inhibitor will be initiated immediately thereafter for 4 weeks. Lesional dosimetry with 124I-PET will be repeated after 4 weeks treatment with the MEK inhibitor (provided there are no AZD6244 delays in treatment) to determine if there has been a significant increase in 124I uptake in the metastatic tumor. Treatment with 131I will be offered to patients whose 124I uptake predicts that a 131I therapeutic dose would deliver &gt; 2000 cGy to the tumor mass.</description>

    <description>Within 1 week of starting the study: Low iodine diet
The patient will receive three bottles of capsules containing the drug AZD6244. Each capsule contains 25 milligrams of AZD6244. They will take 3 capsules orally, by mouth twice a day for 4 weeks. AZD6244 should be taken on an empty stomach (either one hour before or 2 hours after meals). AZD6244 capsules should be taken with water only. Lesional dosimetry with iodine-124 PET will be done twice, at the beginning and at the end of the study. This is done the same way that a radioactive iodine scan is done and is spread out over 5 days. It requires injection with human recombinant TSH (Thyrogen) on day 1 and 2, as well as blood tests on day 1 and day 5. On day 3, you will receive the iodine-124 in form of an oral drink, and the PET scan will be obtained on day 5. You will need to follow a low iodine diet starting 5 days before and throughout the process.</description>

             following (as described in MSKCC protocol 08-066):

               -  index metastatic lesion non-RAI avid on a diagnostic RAI scan performed up to 2
                  years prior to enrolment in the current study, OR

               -  RAI-avid metastatic lesion which remained stable in size or progressed despite
                  RAI treatment 6 months or more prior to entry in the study. Lesions will be
                  assessed by 2 independent observers in nuclear medicine and in endocrinology.

             effects on embryofetal development and survival at dose levels that do not induce
             maternal toxicity in mice. For this reason, female patients will need to be
             post-menopausal or with negative serum pregnancy test if pre-menopausal. Patients of
             childbearing potential must agree to employ adequate contraception throughout the

             estimated creatinine clearance is &lt; 30 ml/min, a 24 hour urine creatinine clearance
