      In Ghana, low micronutrient intakes among pregnant women are a major problem. The standard
      nutritional intervention during pregnancy is iron-folic acid tablets, but adherence is low.
      The investigators have pioneered the use of multiple micronutrient-fortified semi-solid
      pastes called Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements (LNS) (made using vegetable oil, groundnut,
      milk, sugar, and micronutrients), and the investigators' previous studies show that the
      approach could have great potential for use by pregnant and lactating women.

      This study aims to evaluate the effects of LNS-P&amp;L designed for pregnant and lactating women
      and LNS-20gM designed for infants. Pregnant women (n=864) randomly selected from ante-natal
      clinics in Yilo and Manya Krobo districts of Ghana will be randomized to receive daily (a)
      Group 1: Iron/ Folic Acid tablets during pregnancy, and a tablet containing calcium (Ca)
      only (akin to a placebo) during lactation (6 mo), (b) Group 2: Multiple Micronutrient
      tablets during pregnancy and the first six months of lactation, or (c) Group 3: LNS-P&amp;L
      during pregnancy and lactation, whilst their infants receive LNS-20gM daily from 6 to 18
      months. There are two primary outcomes namely:

        1. Maternal primary outcome: Birth length

        2. Child primary outcome: Child length-for-age z-score at 18 mo.

      The investigators hypothesize that a) mean birth length and length-for-age at 18 mo will be
      greater in children whose mothers are in Group 2 than those whose mothers are in Group 1,
      and b) children whose mothers are in Group 3 will have greater birth length and
      length-for-age at 18 mo than the children in either of the other two groups.

      Introduction:

      Inadequate nutrient intakes during pregnancy remain a major problem worldwide. The standard
      nutritional intervention during pregnancy is iron-folic acid tablets, but adherence is
      generally quite low. We have pioneered the use of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS),
      which are multiple micronutrient-fortified semi-solid pastes made using vegetable oil,
      groundnut paste, milk, sugar, and micronutrients, for home fortification of complementary
      foods for infants. Given results of previous studies with Nutributter in Ghana (1, 2) and
      similar LNS in Malawi (3, 4) we believe that the food-based approach using LNS has the
      potential to improve the nutritional status of these women, and thereby also enhance their
      children's growth and micronutrient status.

      Our consortium has formulated LNS-P&amp;L for pregnant and lactating women, and modified the
      Nutributter for children, which has been called LNS-20gM in this trial. The LNS-20gM
      provides generally the Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNI) for 18 vitamins and minerals for
      infants from 6 to 18 mo of age. The LNS-P&amp;L is modeled on the UNICEF/WHO/UNU international
      multiple micronutrient preparation (UNIMMAP) for pregnant and lactating women and similar
      products used in Guinea Bissau (5). Each supplement (20 g/day) will provide 118 kcal/day.
      Both LNS products (LNS-P&amp;L and LNS-20gM) will, in addition to the multiple micronutrients
      provided in the MMN, supply energy (118 kcal/d), fat (11 g/d), protein (2.6 g/d), the
      essential fatty acids linoleic acid (=1.29 g/d) and a-linolenic acid (0.29 to &gt;0.6 g/d), as
      well as calcium, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium.

      Objectives

      The study has two objectives, which are:

        1. To evaluate the effect of LNS-P&amp;L on the nutritional status of Ghanaian pregnant and
           lactating women.

        2. To assess the effect of LNS-P&amp;L given to pregnant and lactating women and LNS-20gM
           provided to children from 6 to 18 mo of age on child growth and micronutrient status.

      Procedures

        1. Recruitment:

           This study will be a community-based, randomized controlled trial with three
           intervention groups. Potential subjects will be Ghanaian pregnant women attending usual
           ante-natal clinics at the Government Hospitals at Atua and Akuse, and the St Martins de
           Porres Catholic Hospital at Agormanya (Manya Krobo District of Ghana), and the Somanya
           Polyclinic at Somanya (Yilo Krobo District of Ghana).

           Enrolment into the study will be done in two steps. First, pregnant women who meet an
           initial set of criteria will be asked their consent (sign a Screening Consent Form) to
           participate in a pre-enrolment screening using a Screening Questionnaire. During this
           screening, which will be conducted at the clinics, results of the routine ante-natal
           examination already entered in the Ante-natal Cards will be inspected. The screening
           questionnaire will also collect additional information, such as description of place of
           residence, not recorded in the Ante-natal cards.

           Second, women who pass the screening will be contacted in their homes, where we will
           provide them with additional details of the study and seek their consent for
           recruitment. If they agree, they will sign a recruitment consent form, and enrolment
           will be said to be completed. Immediately, we will collect background demographic and
           socioeconomic information in the home using a Baseline Questionnaire, and schedule the
           women to come to the laboratory to complete a baseline anthropometric and laboratory
           assessment (blood and urine sampling, hemoglobin, blood pressure and Ultrasound for
           gestational age).

           Pregnant women (n = 864) who have completed the baseline assessments and remain
           eligible for the study will be randomly assigned (using opaque envelopes with group
           designations) to one of three groups: (1) Group 1: Iron and Folic Acid, (2) Group 2:
           Multiple Micronutrient (MMN), and (3) Group 3: Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements (LNS).

        2. Follow up:

           Pregnant women will be followed-up through delivery, up to 6 mo postpartum (i.e.
           remaining part of pregnancy from time of recruitment + 6 mo of lactation), the infants
           born to the women will be followed-up from birth to 18 mo of age. Field Workers will
           visit subjects in their homes biweekly during pregnancy and weekly from birth to 18 mo
           to provide supplements and collect data on morbidity and adherence. In the case of
           multiple births by a woman, (e.g. twins or triplets), one baby will be randomly
           selected immediately after delivery to be the index child from whom infant data and
           blood samples will be collected. Anthropometric data will be collected from the
           unselected twin or triplets, and those in Group 3 will receive LNS-20gM (because of the
           cultural belief that twins and triplets, etc., must be treated the same), but blood
           samples will not be collected from the unselected child. In case of loss of
           child/children during or after delivery, the mother will be followed-up until 6 mo
           postpartum. In case of loss of mother during or after delivery, the baby will be
           followed-up until 18 mo of age.

           If any woman in the study is recommended to take additional vitamins and/ or minerals
           by her physician, we will work with the physician to ensure that any supplement given
           does not lead to excess intakes.

        3. Outcome measures:

      The study will have two primary outcomes namely:

        1. Maternal primary outcome: Birth length, and

        2. Child primary outcome: Child length-for-age z-score at 18 mo.

The LNS products (LNS-P&amp;L and LNS-20gM) will be consumed by being added to prepared food (usually mixed with complementary foods, for the child). Mothers will consume the full sachet of LNS (20 g/day) at one meal each day. Dosage and directions for use of the LNS product for children will be as follows: 20 g (~4 teaspoons) per day divided into 2 portions and consumed at two different times of the day (2 x 2 teaspoons). Mix the portion of the supplement to be consumed with 2-3 tablespoons of the already prepared food (as done previously in our study in Ghana (1)), and eat the mixture before eating the rest of the food. Do not cook food with the supplement. Store supplement at room temperature. There is no need for refrigeration.</description>
