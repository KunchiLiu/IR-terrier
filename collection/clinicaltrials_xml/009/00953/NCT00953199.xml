  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis is a common cause of
      morbidity for which there is no known pharmacologic prophylaxis. Post-ERCP pancreatitis is
      thought to be caused by several factors, including intraductal pressure, multiple duct
      injections with contrast, and neural arc reflexes. Lidocaine is a safe, inexpensive class IV
      antiarrhythmic that has topical anesthetic effects, inhibits trypsin activity, and may
      potentially prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis by injection directly into the pancreatic duct at
      the time of ERCP. Lidocaine has been shown to inhibit phospholipase A2, a key pancreatic
      enzyme, interrupt local arc reflexes to stop neuronal transmission, and to dampen GI tract
      mucosal reflexes to prevent high ductal pressure.

      The key objective of this study is to determine if injection of lidocaine is beneficial in
      preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis. Subjects will be randomized to study group or control
      group in an equal ratio. The physicians performing the ERCP will be unaware of the treatment
      group to which patients have been assigned. Study arm will receive contrast agent
      Diatrizoate 60% (5 ml) diluted with lidocaine 2% (5 ml) during ERCP. Control arm will
      receive contrast agent Diatrizoate 60% (5 ml) diluted with normal saline 0.9% (5 ml) during
      ERCP. Diatrizoate diluted with normal saline is the standard of care. Patients will be
      contacted 1 day and 1 week post-ERCP to assess for symptoms of pancreatitis.

    <description>1:1 combination of contrast dye Diatrizoate 60% (5 ml) diluted with lidocaine 2% (5 ml) used at ERCP. Lidocaine will only be used once, and thus a maximum dose of 100 mg will be employed. If the patient requires more contrast agent, this will be used without the addition of lidocaine.</description>
