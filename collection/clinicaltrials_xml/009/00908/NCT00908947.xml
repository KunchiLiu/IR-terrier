      The objectives of this study are to collect post-market confirmatory evidence of the safety
      and effectiveness of the Bard® LifeStent® Vascular Stent System and LifeStent® XL Vascular
      Stent System (together the &quot;LifeStent® Vascular Stent System&quot;).

      The study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-randomized study enrolling up to
      234 subjects with lifestyle-limiting claudication or ischemic rest pain attributable to
      lesion(s) (stenosed, occluded, restenosed, or re-occluded) in the infra-inguinal segment
      (SFA and/or proximal popliteal artery) that are amenable to treatment by PTA and stenting.
      All subjects enrolled in the study will receive PTA and stenting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject provides written informed consent using an Informed Consent Form (ICF)
             that is reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the site.

          2. Subject agrees to comply with the protocol-mandated follow-up procedures and visits.

          3. The subject is ≥ 21 years old.

          4. Male or female subjects; female subjects of childbearing potential must have a
             negative urine pregnancy test at the time of screening.

          5. The subject has lifestyle-limiting claudication or ischemic rest pain defined as:
             Rutherford Category 2-4.

          6. The target lesion(s) has angiographic evidence of stenosis or restenosis ≥ 50% or
             occlusion (by visual estimate) and is amenable to PTA with stenting.

          7. The total target lesion(s) length must be ≤ 240 mm.

          8. The target vessel reference diameter is ≥ 4.0 mm and ≤ 6.5 mm (by visual estimate),
             and therefore appropriate for treatment with available stent diameters of 6.0 mm and
             7.0 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is unable or unwilling to provide informed consent, or is unable or
             unwilling to conform to the study protocol follow-up procedures and visits.

          2. The subject has claudication or critical limb ischemia described as Rutherford
             Category 1 (mild claudication), 5 (minor tissue loss) or 6 (major tissue loss.

          3. The subject has multiple stenoses or occlusions &gt; 240 mm.

          4. The subject has a previous stent or stent graft located in the target vessel.

          5. The subject has flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion of the inflow tract that cannot
             be adequately corrected (≤ 30% residual stenosis) prior to treatment of the target
             lesion(s). Investigator standard of care practices shall be utilized for treatment of
             inflow.

          6. The subject has a known contraindication (including allergic reaction) to
             antiplatelet/anticoagulant medications, nickel, titanium, tantalum or sensitivity.

          7. The subject has a known contraindication to contrast media that is not amenable to
             pretreatment with steroids or/and antihistamines.

          8. The subject has a known history of bleeding diatheses or coagulopathy.

          9. The subject has concomitant renal failure with a creatinine of &gt; 2.5 mg/dL.

         10. The subject is currently on dialysis or receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

         11. The subject has known concomitant hepatic insufficiency, thrombophlebitis, uremia,
             systemic lupus erythematosus, septicemia or deep vein thrombosis at the time of the
             index procedure.

         12. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or another
             investigational device study that has not completed the primary endpoint, or that
             clinically interferes with the study endpoints. Note: trials requiring extended
             follow-up for products that were investigational, but have since become commercially
             available, are not considered investigational trials.

         13. The subject has another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may cause him/her to be non-compliant with the protocol, confound the data
             interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the
             completion of study procedures and follow-up.

         14. The subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude safe insertion of an introducer sheath.

         15. The target lesion(s) is located within an aneurysm or associated with an aneurysm in
             the vessel segment either proximal or distal to the target lesion(s).

         16. There is angiographic evidence of unresolved thrombus at the target lesion(s) or
             within the target vessel that does not resolve with infusion of thrombolytics and/or
             mechanical thrombectomy (using an approved device) without adverse
             events/complications.

         17. The subject has undergone any non-iliac percutaneous intervention(s) &lt; 7 days prior
             to the index procedure.
