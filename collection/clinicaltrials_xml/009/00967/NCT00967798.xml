      Acute systemic hyperglycemia causes oxidative stress and a pro-inflammatory response. The
      pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by hyperglycemia are toxic to islet insulin producing
      cells, and thus worsen glucose intolerance. Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have a high
      prevalence of CF related diabetes (CFRD) and up to 40% of CF adults develop CFRD. During the
      prediabetic phase in CF, there is progression from normal glucose homeostasis to high risk
      prediabetes characterized by episodes of acute hyperglycemia after meals and during
      respiratory exacerbations. The mild hyperglycemia seen in CF patients with high risk
      prediabetes following a meal would be expected to induce a degree of systemic inflammation
      and oxidative stress. These repetitive episodes, if left unchecked, could lead to
      progression of glucose impairment, worsening severity of oxidative stress and inflammation,
      and ultimately the development of CFRD, all via hyperglycemia-induced toxicity to beta
      cells. Furthermore, this process may be accelerated in CF because lung disease and resultant
      respiratory exacerbations are associated with oxidative stress and inflammation and this
      will further contribute to beta cell damage.

      Sitagliptin is a recently approved agent for type 2 diabetes and markedly enhances insulin
      secretion in the presence of hyperglycemia and has been shown to be effective in preventing
      postprandial hyperglycemia. The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that sitagliptin
      will prevent the development of CFRD in CF subjects with high risk prediabetes by blocking
      postprandial hyperglycemia. The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter, 15-month longitudinal study in 118 CF subjects with high
      risk prediabetes to test this hypothesis. Specifically, the investigators aim to show that
      chronic treatment with sitagliptin: prevents the conversion to diabetes; results in
      preservation of beta cell function; reduces systemic measures of oxidative stress and
      inflammation; and slows the rate of progression of lung disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of 118 CF subjects aged 13
      years of age or older who have high risk prediabetes. High risk prediabetes is defined
      during the screening visit by performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and finding
      that the fasting plasma glucose level is between 110-125 mg/dl and/or the 2-hour plasma
      glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg/dl. Upon enrollment, subjects will be randomized to
      receive either sitagliptin or placebo. Each subject will be followed for 15 months to
      determine if sitagliptin prevents the conversion to frank diabetes.

      The following will be done at enrollment and every 6 months: an OGTT with collection of
      blood at 0, 1/2, and 2 hours for measurement of glucose and insulin in order to determine
      progression of glucose intolerance; collection of blood at time 0 and 2 hours during the
      OGTT and measurement of systemic redox status, oxidative stress, and degree of inflammation
      to determine the degree of basal oxidative stress and inflammation as well as the degree of
      hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation; collection of exhaled breath
      condensate in a subset of subjects at selected sites at time 0 and 2 hours during the OGTT
      and measurement of airway redox status, degree of inflammation, and glucose levels to
      determine basal respiratory tract redox status and inflammation, the degree of
      hyperglycemia-induced changes in redox status and inflammation, and correlation between
      plasma and airway glucose levels; collection of blood to determine safety of the study
      medication (liver and renal function, complete blood count, electrolyte concentrations); and
      determination of progression of lung disease as defined by the number of respiratory
      exacerbations severe enough to require hospitalization and the rate of decline in lung
      function.

      The results of two OGTTs performed at least one week apart will be used to determine whether
      the subject has converted from high risk prediabetes to frank diabetes (primary objective).
      Conversion to CFRD will be defined when both OGTTs are abnormal (abnormal is defined as a
      fasting plasma glucose level greater than 125 mg/dl and/or a 2 hour glucose level greater
      than 199 mg/dl). The results of measures of redox balance, oxidant stress and inflammation
      (secondary objectives) will provide biologic plausibility to our concept on the mechanism of
      action of sitagliptin in preventing the development of CF diabetes.

      Hemoglobin-specific A1c fraction (HbA1c) will be measured half-way between the 6-monthly
      visits and a rise of more than 0.5% from the enrollment value will result in two OGTT tests
      done at least one week apart to determine if diabetes has developed. At these interval study
      visits, blood will also be collected to assess the safety of the study drug and, if the
      subject is female, to determine if pregnancy has occurred.

      In the event that diabetes does develop, the study drug (or placebo) will be stopped and the
      subject will have completed the study.

      In summary, this is a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether
      sitagliptin prevents the conversion of CF subjects with high-risk prediabetes to frank
      diabetes. If successful, this would be the first treatment modality available to prevent the
      development of CFRD, a serious and life shortening complication of CF.
