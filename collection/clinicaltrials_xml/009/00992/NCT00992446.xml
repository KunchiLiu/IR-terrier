  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well bortezomib and vorinostat work in
      treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) after patients' own stem cell (autologous)
      transplant. Bortezomib and vorinostat in the laboratory may stop the growth of lymphoma
      cells and make them more likely to die by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Giving bortezomib together with vorinostat after an autologous stem cell transplant
      may thus kill lymphoma cells that remain after transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess toxicities of combining vorinostat and bortezomib as maintenance therapy after
      autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for NHL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Ability to complete planned therapy.

      II. Time to disease progression, event-free survival.

      III. Overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      All patients receive carmustine intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day -7; cytarabine IV
      twice daily (BID) over 3 hours and etoposide IV BID over 2 hours on days -6 to -3; and
      melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -2. Only patients with history of cluster of
      differentiation (CD)20+ NHL receive additional rituximab IV on days -19 and -12. Patients
      undergo ASCT on day 0. Patients then receive bortezomib IV on days 2 and 8, and vorinostat
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Treatment with bortezomib and vorinostat repeats
      for total of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 2 years.
