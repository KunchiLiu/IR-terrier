    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if the drug sildenafil (Viagra) has an effect on the
      frequency of recurrent priapism and the quality of life in males with sickle cell disease.

      The proposed research is designed to investigate the utility of continuous, long-term
      phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor therapy as an intervention for recurrent ischemic
      priapism, a disorder of non-willful, excessive penile erection, in patients with sickle cell
      disease (SCD). Although precise prevalence figures are not available, priapism in SCD is
      highly prevalent and thought to afflict approximately 40% of males, based on available
      literature. Additionally, the disorder exacts devastating consequences, including erectile
      tissue necrosis, erectile dysfunction, and psychological distress. Management of this
      disorder remains challenging because the mechanisms underlying priapism are incompletely
      understood.
