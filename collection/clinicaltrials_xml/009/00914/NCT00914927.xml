  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of once-daily Oral E5501 in subjects
      with chronic liver diseases and thrombocytopenia prior to elective surgical or diagnostic
      procedures, to evaluate the safety of short-term administration of E5501 and to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of E5501.
