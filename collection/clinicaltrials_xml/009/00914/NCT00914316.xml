  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate whether supervised treadmill exercise combined with
      ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily provides an incremental benefit in absolute walking distance
      over supervised exercise alone in patients with stable claudication. Investigators also seek
      to determine if the administration of ranolazine provides a sustained benefit after the
      completion of a supervised exercise regimen. Lastly, investigators wish to determine whether
      both exercise and ranolazine improves peak oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold in
      patients with stable claudication.

      The treatment groups are:

      A. Group A will be randomized to a 12 week supervised exercise program and ranolazine,
      (Ranexa) 1000 mg orally, twice daily, by mouth.

      B. Group B will be randomized to a 12 week supervised exercise program and placebo.

      After the 12 week supervised exercise program, all participants will undergo a second
      randomization to ranolazine or placebo for an additional 12 weeks, during which independent
      walking will be encouraged.

      Both groups will participate in a two week lead-in period after each randomization of the
      trial, allowing for the stabilization of their medications and dosing of ranolazine.
      Medications such as cilostazol, calcium channel blockers and nitrates will be discontinued
      during the lead-in period, unless their use is for management for your high blood pressure.
      Anti-platelet (blood thinner) medications will be continued throughout the trial.
