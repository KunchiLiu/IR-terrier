  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test a hypothesis that the RIVS system will have a higher rate of successful
      first PIV placement compared to conventional catheter without a significant increase in
      complications and time of procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis to be statistically tested was that the RIVS system will have a higher rate
      of successful first attempt peripheral intravenous placement success as compared to
      conventional peripheral intravenous catheters without a significant increase in device
      related complications and procedure time.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Any type of oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy or post-chemotherapy (without a
             port/cannula), or over 65 years

          -  Requires peripheral IV as determined by examining physician

          -  Requires the IV when a study nurse or resident is available

          -  Able to sign an informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Active systemic or cutaneous infection or inflammation;

          -  Pre-existing immunodeficiency disorder and/or chronic use of systemic steroids;

          -  Known, significant history of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy, von Willebrand's
             disease or current platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3, baseline INR â‰¥1.8, or
             fibrinogen level less than 150 mg/dl (if received a fibrinolytic agent within prior
             24 hours);

          -  Currently involved in any other investigational clinical trials;

          -  Previous vascular grafts or surgery at the target vessel access site;

             procedure, or lactating;

          -  Central line available

          -  Requirement for immediate IV placement (patient's condition would potentially be
             compromised if there is a time delay in IV placement)
