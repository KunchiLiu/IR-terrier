    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn if adding hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to
      erlotinib helps treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Another goal of this research
      study is to learn more about NSCLC and how it may respond to study treatment. Erlotinib
      (Tarceva) is a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). TKIs block a protein
      called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR may control tumor growth and tumor
      cell survival. However, although TKI drugs can work for some lung cancer patients for a
      period of time, eventually the tumor finds a way to resist or counteract the TKI treatment
      and it begins to grow again. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug approved by the FDA for
      treating malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and several other diseases. Laboratory research
      suggests that when HCQ is given with a TKI, it may help delay or prevent TKI resistance from
      developing.

      -  Because no one knows which of the study options are best, participants will be
           randomized into of the study groups: Group A (erlotinib) or Group B (erlotinib and
           HCQ). Study treatment will be divided into time periods called cycles. Each study
           treatment cycle is 28 days.

        -  Erlotinib (Group A and Group B) will be taken orally once a day. Hydroxychloroquine
           (Group B) will be taken orally once a day after taking erlotinib.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed day 1 of each cycle: physical
           examination, performance status assessment, questions about any symptoms or side
           effects, blood for routine tests. The following procedures will be performed at certain
           study visits: Research blood tests (cycle 1, cycle 2, then every other even cycle); eye
           exam (cycle 4, cycle 7, and then every 3 months); assessment of the tumor with CT or
           MRI scan (done at the end of even cycles.

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST criteria, defined as the presence of at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be
             recorded) as 10mm or greater with spiral CT scan

          -  ECOG Performance status of 0, 1 or 2

          -  Since prior radiation or surgery, 14 days or more must have elapsed before starting
             protocol treatment

          -  No prior treatment with erlotinib, gefitinib, or other small molecule EGFR-TKIs.
             Prior treatment in the adjuvant setting is allowed if at least 1 year has elapsed
             since TKI course.

          -  Adequate organ function as outlined in the protocol

          -  Patients must undergo a screening eye exam to obtain approval for HCQ treatment,
             which establishes the absence of baseline conditions include macular degeneration,
             visual field changes, other retinal disease, and cataracts that interfere with
             required funduscopic examinations

          -  No G6PD deficiency, as HCQ may cause hemolysis in patients with G6DP

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic CNS metastases or newly diagnosed CNS metastases that have not yet been
             definitively treated with radiation and/or surgery. Note that patients with a history
             of CNS metastases or cord compression are allowed if they have been definitively
             treated and are clinically stable. Maintenance steroids are allowed but maintenance
             seizure medication with an EIAED is not allowed

          -  Prior radiation therapy inclusive of all identified target lesions. Note that prior
             palliative radiation to bony disease, CNS disease, or a limited thoracic area is
             allowed, provided that there is measurable disease outside the field and radiation is
             completed at least two weeks prior to starting treatment and the patient has fully
             recovered from all side effects

          -  Current use of hydroxychloroquine for any reason

          -  Known hypersensitivity to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, or any closely related
             drug: erlotinib, gefitinib, or any closely related drug

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Female subjects of childbearing potential
             and male subjects must practice acceptable methods of birth control

          -  Any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease. Note that patients with
             chronic, stable radiographic changes who are asymptomatic are eligible

          -  Invasive malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma
             of the cervix, basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin

          -  Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study, including a prior
             diagnosis of porphyria or non-light-sensitive psoriasis, as HCQ can significantly
             exacerbate both of these conditions

          -  Use of any non-FDA approved or investigational agent in 30 days or less of enrolling
             onto the trial, or failure to recover from the side effects of any of these agents

          -  Penicillamine use for Wilson's disease or any other indication, as concomitant use
             with HCQ can increase toxicity to penicillamine

          -  Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks
