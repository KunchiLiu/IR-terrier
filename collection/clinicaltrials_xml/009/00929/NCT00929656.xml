    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in this country with more than 1 million
      Americans reporting difficulty with daily activities. Loss of independence in self-care
      tasks is primarily due to limited recovery of the arm. This study will determine if the
      addition of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to excite the lesioned hemisphere (side
      of the brain affected by the stroke), to progressive functional task exercise either of the
      weakened arm alone or of both arms together will improve arm recovery to a greater degree
      than one of these two types of arm exercise alone. Individuals post-stroke will participate
      in 16 sessions of 1) arm rehabilitation alone (with the weaker arm only or with both arms
      together) or 2) arm rehabilitation plus TMS. The investigators will assess arm movement
      ability and function immediately following the 4-week intervention and at a 30-day follow-up
      to determine retention of immediate gains. The investigators hypothesize that those who
      receive TMS as an adjuvant will have improved arm movement ability than those who only
      exercise.

      Limited recovery of upper extremity (UE) function post-stroke continues to be one of the
      greatest challenges faced in neurorehabilitation. There is an urgent unmet need to identify
      effective approaches to drive UE recovery in this population. In response to this challenge,
      the overall purpose of this proposed research plan is to develop rehabilitation
      interventions that restore UE motor recovery. Contemporary approaches to motor
      rehabilitation are based on evidence that behavioral experience drives cortical
      reorganization following neural injury. Although the rationale of driving the damaged motor
      cortex by focused training of the paretic UE appears straightforward, and has historically
      been the focus of rehabilitation, functional recovery remains limited. There remains a gap
      between this central neurobiological change and a meaningful behavioral change. There is a
      need, therefore, to augment or potentiate behavioral experience. This proposal will address
      this gap by examining two potential drivers of the lesioned hemisphere: 1) the non-lesioned
      hemisphere via engagement of the unaffected UE in behavioral training and 2) stimulation of
      the lesioned hemisphere via repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). This
      proposal builds on the foundation of the applicant's previous work which suggested that the
      contralesional, intact, hemisphere could be used to drive the lesioned hemisphere through
      bimanual movement. Additionally, it is possible to drive the lesioned hemisphere externally
      using rTMS to enhance cortical stimulation. Thus, pairing externally-driven enhancement of
      cortical excitability with internally-driven activation of the intact hemisphere during
      bilateral movements could combine to further increase excitability in the lesioned
      hemisphere and manifest improved movement capability of the paretic UE. The fundamental
      hypothesis guiding this proposal is that increased excitability of the lesioned cortex will
      improve behavioral function of the paretic UE post-stroke. To investigate the overall
      hypothesis the investigators will examine these drivers of cortical excitability and their
      role in UE recovery by addressing the following aims:

      Specific Aim 1. Determine the magnitude of difference in central and behavioral changes in
      individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis randomized to a bilateral versus unilateral UE
      motor training program.

      Specific Aim 2a. Determine the magnitude of difference in central and behavioral changes in
      individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis randomized to behavioral UE training compared to
      behavioral UE training + rTMS.

      Specific Aim 2b. Determine the differential effects of rTMS on bilateral behavioral training
      compared to unilateral behavioral training as measured both centrally and behaviorally in
      individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis Post-stroke upper limb paresis and resultant loss
      of functional ability continues to present a barrier to those post-stroke in returning to
      full societal participation. Interventions that directly target the mechanism of
      hemiparesis, including decreased excitability of the lesioned hemisphere, are most likely to
      promote true recovery as opposed to the oft observed functional compensation in these
      individuals.
