  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a supervised mixed aerobic and strength
      training (MAST) program is effective in improving overall physical fitness and blood flow in
      the brain and lowering risk factors of coronary artery disease (CAD) in women with metabolic
      syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions and disorders that increase the risk for
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and strokes. Sedentary lifestyle is one of the risk factors,
      which decrease overall physical fitness and together with aging may lead to decrease in
      physical functioning in everyday life as well as changes in blood flow in the brain and
      cognitive functions. Regular physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of
      cardiovascular disease. It may also improve blood flow velocity and cognitive functions.
      Physical activity should be as effective as possible, but also as safe as possible.
      Supervised mixed aerobic and strength training (MAST) program for 4 months enables to
      individualize the intensity of aerobic exercise based on measured maximal exercise capacity.
      Throughout each training session heart rate will be monitored with a new real time wireless
      ECG system.
