      This is a randomized, controlled, double-blinded study. Volunteers who are scheduled for
      laser treatment of Port Wine Stains will be screened and eligible subjects will be asked to
      participate. The patients will be randomized and placed in the experimental or the control
      group. They will be given unlabeled sachets and instructed to apply the product each night
      to the right half of their treated lesion beginning the night after surgery for 4 weeks.
      Digital photographs of the Port Wine Stain will be taken prior to surgery and repeated at
      follow up appointments at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after surgery. The
      photographs will be analyzed by blinded board certified plastic surgeons as well as a
      computer program.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patient between the ages of 2 and 60 years with a vascular
             malformation that is seeking cosmetic treatment.

          -  All races will be included as well as male and female.

          -  Clinical data on the usage of Aldara below the age of 2 years is limited and
             therefore all patients in the study will have to be at least 2 years of age.

          -  The majority of port wine stains are initially treated during childhood

          -  In order to determine the effectiveness of Aldara as an adjunct to laser therapy of
             Port Wine Stains, some of the patients in the study need to have lesions that have
             not undergone previous treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under the age of 2 or over the age of 60.

          -  Patients that have serious medical problems that would put them at risk of the
             anesthesia.

          -  Patients that have sensitivity reactions to the ingredients in the product including
             imiquimod, isostearic acid, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, white petrolatum,
             polysorbate 60, sorbitan monostearate, glycerin, xanthan gum, purified water, benzyl
