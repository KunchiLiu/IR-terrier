          -  Satisfactory baseline medical assessment by history and physical examination.

          -  Safety laboratory test results within the parameters specified in the protocol.

          -  Comprehension of the study requirements, ability to comprehend and comply with
             procedures for collection of safety data, expressed availability for the required
             study period, and ability and willingness to attend scheduled visits as demonstrated
             by signature on the informed consent document.

          -  Access to a consistent means of telephone contact, which may be either in the home or
             at the workplace, land line, or mobile, but NOT a pay phone or other multiple-user
             device.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

          -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination; and

          -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of first vaccination; and

          -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and
             for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical history of physician-confirmed infection with an A/California/7/2009
             (H1N1)v-like virus.

          -  Previous vaccination at any time with an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like virus
             vaccine.

          -  With the exception of seasonal influenza vaccination, administration of any
             vaccine(s) within 30 days before study vaccination on Day 0. Seasonal influenza
             vaccine may be administered up to 14 days prior to study vaccination on Day 0.

          -  Planned administration of any vaccine other than the study vaccines between Day 0 and

          -  History of an acute evolving neurological disorder or history of Guillain-Barré
             syndrome within 6 weeks of receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine.
