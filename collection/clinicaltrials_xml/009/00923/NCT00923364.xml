      Background:

        -  Stem cells are immature blood cells that grow in the bone marrow and produce all of the
           cells needed for normal blood and immunity. Stem cells can be taken from one person
           (donor) and given to another person (recipient) through allogeneic stem cell
           transplantation. Donor stem cells can then replace the recipient s stem cells in the
           bone marrow, restoring normal blood production and immunity. Most allogeneic
           transplants now use stem cells collected from the donor s blood in a process called
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  MonoMAC is an immunodeficiency disease that is characterized by a lack of monocytes, a
           type of white blood cell, and an increased risk of developing mycobacteria infections
           that may cause tuberculosis.

        -  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been used successfully to treat many kinds of
           immune diseases and cancers that develop in blood or immune system cells. Researchers
           have been studying a particular kind of stem cell transplantation that uses lower than
           usual doses of chemotherapy and particular combinations of drugs to improve the results
           of the procedure for patients with blood-related cancers and pre-cancerous conditions.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and efficacy of reduced-intensity hematopoietic stem cell
           transplants (a particular stem cell transplantation procedure) for treating MonoMAC.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 18 60 years of age who have MonoMAC and who have been matched with a suitable
           stem cell donor.

      Design:

        -  Donors and recipients will undergo separate procedures as part of this protocol.

        -  Donors:

        -  National Institutes of Health researchers will take the donor s medical history,
           perform a physical exam, take blood samples, and explain the procedure. Tests will be
           performed to check the donor s heart, lung, kidney, and liver function.

        -  Donors will receive injections of a drug called filgrastim (G-CSF), which causes stem
           cells to travel from bone marrow into blood. The G-CSF shots will be given for 5 to 7
           days before the collection procedure.

        -  Donors will undergo apheresis to collect white blood cells and stem cells directly from
           the blood, which can be done as an outpatient procedure. Researchers may consider the
           alternative of directly collecting bone marrow from the donor, which will require an
           overnight hospital stay.

        -  Recipients:

        -  Recipients will receive 3 days of pre-transplant chemotherapy and radiation therapy to
           prepare for the transplant. For 4 days before the transplant, recipients will receive
           the chemotherapy drug fludarabine, followed by a single dose of radiation therapy, and
           will also receive the drugs tacrolimus and sirolimus to prevent the donor cells from
           attacking the recipient s normal tissues.

        -  Recipients will then receive the transplant of donor stem cells and will continue to
           receive tacrolimus and sirolimus for 3 months after the transplant to prevent the donor
           cells from attacking the recipient s normal tissues. Recipients will be discharged from
           the hospital once their condition is stable.

        -  Recipients will visit the NCI clinic regularly for the first 5 months after the
           transplant, and then less often for at least 5 years. Recipients may receive additional
           donor immune cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) after the transplant if the study
           doctors believe they are needed.

      BACKGROUND:

      Mutations in GATA2 lead to an immunodeficiency disease that transforms intomyelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This syndrome, previously known as
      MonoMAC, has 4 clinical features: 1) infections with Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC) and
      other opportunistic infections as a teenager or young adult, 2) a peripheral blood leukocyte
      flow cytometry profile with Tlymphocytes, but a severe deficiency of monocytes,
      B-lymphocytes, and Natural Killer (NK) cells, 3) the propensity to progress to MDS/AML, and
      4) mutations in the gene GATA2. In this pilot study we propose to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of a reduced intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      regimen for patients with mutations in GATA2. We are particularly interested in determining
      whether allogeneic HSCT using this regimen reconstitutes normal hematopoiesis in patients
      with mutations in GATA2.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine efficacy, namely whether reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT results in
           engraftment and restores normal hematopoiesis by day +100 in patients with mutations in
           GATA2.

        -  To determine the safety of this HSCT regimen in patients with mutations in GATA2,
           including transplant related toxicity, the incidence of acute and chronic
           graft-versushost disease, immune reconstitution, overall survival, and disease-free
           survival

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Eligibility includes patients 12-60 years old with mutations in GATA2 who have a life
      expectancy of &gt; 3 months but &lt; 24 months, and who have a 10/10 matched related donor, a
      10/10 or 9/10 matched unrelated donor (HLA -A, -B, -C, DRB1, DQB1 by high resolution typing
      identified through the National Marrow Donor Program), a 4/6 (or greater HLA -A, -B, DRB1)
      matched unrelated umbilical cord donor, or a haploidentical donor. Patients with GATA2
      mutations who are 12-17 years of age are required to have MDS with chromosomal abnormalities
      to be eligible for this protocol.

      DESIGN:

        -  Patients with mutations in GATA2 with a 10/10 matched related or 10/10 matched
           unrelated donor, will receive a reduced-intensity pre-transplant conditioning regimen
           consisting of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day on days -4, -3, and -2, 200 cGy total body
           irradiation (TBI) on day -1, and HSCT on day 0. Patients with mutations in GATA2 and a
           9/10 matched unrelated donor will receive a reduced-intensity
           pre-transplantconditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day on days -4,
           -3, and -2, 300cGy total body irradiation (TBI) on day -1, and HSCT on day 0. Patients
           with mutations in GATA2 with umbilical cord blood units will receive a
           reduced-intensity conditioningregimen with cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on day -6,
           fludarabine 40 mg/m2 on days -6 to -2, equine ATG 30 mg/kg IV on days -6, -5 and -4,
           200 cGy TBI on day -1, and HSCT on day 0. Patients with a haploidentical donor will
           receive a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg on
           days -6 and -5, fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on 4days -6 to -2, and 200 cGy TBI on day -1.
           Donor bone marrow cells will be infused on day 0.

        -  Post-transplant immunosuppression for graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis will
           consist of sirolimus (Rapamycin) and tacrolimus until day +180, provided that there is
           no evidence of graft-versus-host disease. Post-transplant immunosuppression for
           graftversus-host-disease prophylaxis for recipients of haploidentical donors will
           consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on days +3 and +4, along with sirolimus from day
           +5 to day 180, and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180, providing that there is no GVHD.

                  Patients previously treated for acute myelogenous leukemia are eligible if they
                  have less than or equal to 10% blasts in the bone marrow in the absence of
                  G-CSF.

                  Subjects 12-17 years of age are required to have MDS with chromosomal
                  abnormalities in addition to mutation in the GATA2 gene for enrollment on this
                  protocol.

               5. Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50%, preferably by 2-D echo, or by MUGA, or
                  shortening fraction &gt; 28% by ECHO, obtained within 28 days of enrollment.

              12. Disease status: Patients are to be referred in remission for evaluation. Should
                  a patient have progressive disease or a donor not be available after enrollment,
                  the patient will be referred back to their primary hematologist-oncologist for
                  treatment. If this course of action is not in the best interest of the patient
                  according to the clinical judgment of the PI/LAI, then the patient may receive
                  standard treatment for the malignant disease under the current study. If under
                  either of these settings, it becomes apparent that the patient will not be able
                  to proceed to transplant, then he/she must come off study. Recipient-Subjects
                  receiving a standard therapy will be told about the therapy, associated risks,
                  benefits alternatives of the proposed therapy, and availability of receiving the
                  same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA- RECIPIENT:

          1. HIV infection.

          2. Chronic active hepatitis B. Patient may be hepatitis B core antibody positive. For
             patients with a concomitant positive hepatitis B surface antigen, patients will
             require a hepatology consultation. The risk-benefit profile of transplant and
             hepatitis B will be discussed with the patient, and eligibility determined by the PI
             and the protocol chairperson.

          3. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.

          4. Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.

          5. Active CNS involvement by malignancy (patients with known positive CSF cytology or
             parenchymal lesions visible by CT or MRI).

          6. Pregnant or lactating.

          7. Sexually active individuals capable of becoming pregnant who are unable or unwilling
             to use effective form(s) of contraception during time enrolled on study and for 1
             year post-transplant. Effective forms of contraception include one or more of the
             following: intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or
             implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy, partner s vasectomy, barrier methods,
             (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or abstinence. The effects on breast-milk are
             also unknown and may be harmful to the infant; therefore, women should not breast
             feed during the interval from study entry to one year post-transplant. Males on the
             protocol must use an effective form of contraception at study entry, and for one year
             post-transplant. The effects of transplant, the radiation, and the medications used
             after transplant may be harmful to a fetus.

          8. Presence of active malignancy in another organ system other than the hematopoietic

          9. No available 10/10 HLA-matched related or 8/8 matched unrelated donor, or 4/6 (or
             greater) matched UCB unit(s) with a total dose of greater than or equal to 3.5 times
             10(7) TNC/kg.

         10. Lack of mutation in GATA2 as demonstrated by the CLIA certified laboratory of Dr.
             Steven Holland in the NIAID.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA- MATCHED RELATED DONOR:

          1. Related donor matched at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ loci by high resolution typing
             (10/10 antigen/allele match) are acceptable donors.

          2. Matched related donors for pediatric recipients must be 18 years of age or older. If
             more than one matched related donor is available, we will select the oldest donor to
             further decrease the risk of potential disease transmission.

          3. Ability to give informed consent.

          4. Age 18-60 years.

          5. No history of life-threatening opportunistic infection.

          6. Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary
             central venous catheter for apheresis.

          7. Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C
             antibody negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission of these infections
             to the recipient.

          8. A donor who is lactating must be willing and able to interrupt breast-feeding or
             substitute formula feeding for her infant during the period of filgrastim
             administration and for two days following the final dose. Filgrastim may be secreted
             in human milk, although its bioavailability from this source is not known. Limited
             clinical data suggest that short-term administration of filgrastim or sargramostim to
             neonates is not associated with adverse outcomes.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA- MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR:

          1. Unrelated donor matched at 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, and DQB1 loci by high
             resolution typing.

          2. Matched unrelated donors for pediatric recipients must be 18 years of age or older.

          3. The evaluation of donors shall be in accordance with existing NMDP Standard Policies
             and Procedures. General donor inclusion criteria specified in the NMDP Standard.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA- MATCHED RELATED DONOR:

          1. Age less than 18 years.

          2. HIV infection.

          3. Chronic active hepatitis B. Donor may be hepatitis core antibody positive.

          4. History of psychiatric disorder which in the opinion of the PI may compromise
             compliance with transplant protocol, or which does not allow to be appropriately
             informed.

          5. History of hypertension that is not controlled by medication, stroke, or severe heart
             disease. Individuals with symptomatic angina will be considered to have severe heart
             disease and will not be eligible to be a donor.

          6. Other medical contraindications to stem cell donation (i.e. severe atherosclerosis,
             autoimmune disease, iritis or episcleritis, deep venous thrombosis, cerebrovascular
             accident).

          7. History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially
             curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-by-case basis.
             The risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor
             cells at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the patient.

          8. Donors must not be pregnant. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication under this
             protocol. The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown. Donors of
             childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception. Effective forms
             of contraception include one or more of the following: intrauterine device (IUD),
             hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy,
             partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or
             abstinence.

          9. Thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 150,000 per micro l) at baseline evaluation.

         10. Donors receiving experimental therapy or investigational agents.

         11. Sensitivity to filgrastim or to E. coli-derived recombinant protein products.

         12. History of autoimmune disorders, with the exception of thyroid disorders.

         13. History of documented deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA- MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR:

        Failure to qualify as an NMDP donor

        INCLUSION CRITERIA- UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD UNIT-HLA TYPING AND DOSE

          1. At least an HLA UCB 4/6 match (Class I-A, B by low resolution, and Class II-DR by
             high resolution) to recipient. The following algorithm will be applied to determine
             if patient will receive single or double umbilical cord graft:

          2. For Single UCB SCT:

               -  If 6/6 match the unit must have &gt; 3 x 10(7) nucleated cells /kg of recipient
                  body weight.

               -  If 5/6 match the unit must have &gt; 4 x 10(7) nucleated cells /kg of recipient
                  body weight.

               -  If 4/6 match the unit must have &gt; 5 x 10(7) nucleated cells/kg of recipient body
                  weight. Recipient body weight will be determined as per standard guidelines.

          3. If no single UCB with the above characteristics is available, a double UCB will be
             considered. Units will be selected with the following criteria:

               -  Both units will be at least 4/6 match (Class I-A, B by low resolution, Class
                  II-DR by high resolution) to recipient, and should be at least a 4/6 match
                  (Class I-A, B by low resolution, Class II-DR by high resolution) to each other.

               -  At least one UCB will have a minimum cell dose of 2.0 X 10(7) TNC/kg of
                  recipient body weight.

               -  The minimum combined dose of both units must be at least 3.5 x 10(7) TNC/kg of
                  recipient body weight.

               -  The smaller of the two units (UCB2) will have a minimum of 1.5 X 10(7) TNC/kg of
                  recipient body weight.

               -  The TNC of non-RBC reduced units will be dose corrected by -25% to allow for
                  cell loss while washing the unit.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA- HAPLOIDENTICAL RELATED DONOR:

          -  A haploidentical donor that shares one haplotype in common with the recipient such
             that HLA compatibility will be a minimum of 5 out of 10 HLA loci matched. The HLA
             loci to be tested will be HLA A, B, Cw, DRB1, and DQB1. A minimum number of
             mismatches is desirable; however if several options are available the selection of a
             donor will be based on the loci where the mismatch occurs and the relative importance
             of its potential immunological function. Donor-recipient pairs will initially be
             typed molecularly to provide a low resolution typing (antigen-level) to aid in the
             selection of the potential donor. Upon review of the familial inheritance pattern, a
             qualified HLA staff member will review haplotype inheritance. High resolution
             (allele-level) typing will be performed. Final selection of a donor will be in
             consultation with NCI physicians and qualified HLA personnel. Haploidentical related
             donors for pediatric recipients must be 15 years of age or older. If more than one
             haploidentical related donor is available, we will evaluate each donor individually
             according to overall health, ABO matching, CMV, etc. to select the donor

          -  Age 15-60 years

          -  No history of life-threatening opportunistic infection

          -  Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary
             central venous catheter for apheresis.

          -  Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C
             antibody negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission of these infections
             to the recipient.

          -  Haploidentical donors will undergo marrow harvest with general anesthesia. Subjects
             will undergo anesthesia consultation, and meet criteria for eligibility/enrollment.
             CD34+ fraction

        will be determined.

          -  Subjects will also undergo the Donor Health History Screen to determine donor
             eligibility using standard DTM criteria in the Dowling Apheresis Clinic by skilled
             staff in the Blood Services Section for adult patients and age-appropriate
             questioning when indicated for pediatric subjects.

          -  Subjects will undergo follow-up history and physical examination within 1 week of
             donation.

          -  History of psychiatric disorder which in the opinion of the PI may compromise
             compliance with transplant protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed

          -  History of hypertension that is not controlled by medication, stroke, or severe heart
             disease. Individuals with symptomatic angina will be considered to have severe heart
             disease and will not be eligible to be a donor.
