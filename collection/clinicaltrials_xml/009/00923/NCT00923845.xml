  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Low-dose chemotherapy is easier for the body to tolerate than typical high-dose chemotherapy
      and involves a shorter period of complete immune suppression.

      Donor immune cells called lymphocytes, or T cells, fight residual tumor cells that might
      have remained in the recipients body after stem cell transplant, in what is called a
      graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect.

      The immune-suppressing drug sirolimus appears to help prevent graft-versus-host disease
      (GVHD), a side effect of stem cell transplant in which donated T cells sometimes attack
      healthy tissues, damaging organs such as the liver, intestines and skin.

      Th2 cells are cells collected from the transplant donor and grown in a high concentration of
      sirolimus.

      Objectives:

      To determine whether stem cell transplantation using low-dose chemotherapy and
      sirolimus-generated Th2 cells can cause a remission of advanced kidney cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age who have kidney cancer that has spread beyond the
      kidney and who have a tissue-matched sibling stem cell donor.

      Design:

      Patients undergo stem cell transplantation as follows:

        -  Low-intensity chemotherapy with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide over a 21-day period
           to reduce the level of the immune system to prepare for the transplant. Pentostatin is
           given through a vein (intravenous (IV)) on days 1, 8 and 15; cyclophosphamide tablets
           are taken by mouth for 21 consecutive days.

        -  Sirolimus tablets, taken by mouth, starting 2 days before the transplant and continuing
           until 60 days after the transplant.

        -  IV infusions of stem cells and Th2 cells.

      Following the transplant, patients have the following procedures:

        -  Additional Th2 cell infusions on days 14 and 45 after the transplant.

        -  Follow-up visits at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center twice a
           week for the first 6 months after the transplant and then less frequently for at least
           5 years to evaluate response to treatment and treatment side effects. Evaluations
           include a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 1 month after transplant and periodic blood
           tests and imaging procedures (e.g., computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) scans).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents a potentially effective
      treatment option for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      In a pilot clinical trial in refractory hematologic malignancy subjects, we have found that
      augmentation of a T cell-replete allograft with donor Th2 cells generated ex vivo in
      sirolimus (rapamycin; Th2.rapa cells) allows prompt donor engraftment after
      outpatient-intensity chemotherapy. This transplant approach has been associated with a low
      incidence of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD).

      Based on these data, we seek to safely achieve objective clinical regression of metastatic
      RCC by the following new transplant approach. (1) The allograft will be administered after a
      low intensity, outpatient induction chemotherapy regimen consisting of pentostatin and
      cyclophosphamide. This regimen is intended to provide sufficient host immune T cell
      depletion, and as such, a conventional preparative regimen will not be administered. (2) To
      avoid mixed chimerism for rapid potentiation of graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects, a growth
      colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized allograft will be augmented with donor
      lymphocyte infusion at day 14 post-transplant consisting of Th2.rapa cells.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: (1) Determine whether this new, low-intensity transplant approach can
      yield objective partial or complete remission of metastatic RCC, with the goal of ruling out
      a partial response (PR)/complete response (CR) rate of 20% in favor of a rate of 60%.

      Secondary objectives: (1) Evaluate the safety and immune-depleting properties of the
      pentostatin/cyclophosphamide regimen; (2) Characterize the engraftment kinetics and GVHD
      profile of this new transplant approach; and (3) Characterize post-transplant immunity in
      study subjects, including cytokine phenotype, immune reconstitution, and potential
      anti-tumor effector mechanisms.

      Eligibility:

      Adults (18 - 75 years) with metastatic RCC who have an eligible 6/6 human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA)-matched sibling donor.

      Must have had one prior therapy with either sorafenib, sunitib, or temsirolimus or any other
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agent for therapy of metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma..

      Life expectancy greater than or equal to 3 months, Karnofsky score greater than or equal to
      80, relatively normal organ function, and absence of central nervous system (CNS)
      metastases.

      Design:

      Patients will receive a 21-day course of pentostatin (intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and
      15; 4 mg/m^2 per dose) and daily oral cyclophosphamide (200 mg per day).

      Patients will receive a mobilized, T cell-replete allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell graft
      followed by a pre-emptive donor lymphocyte infusion with donor Th2 cells at day 14
      post-transplant. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of a short-course of sirolimus plus
      maintenance therapy with cyclosporine A.

      If greater than or equal to 2/5 partial or complete responses are observed within 6 months
      post-transplant, the therapy will be considered potentially promising, and will be expanded
      in a Simon two-stage design to evaluate a total of n = 14 subjects. If greater than or equal
      to 5/14 PR/CR are achieved, the therapy will be considered worthy of further investigation.

    <description>Response was assessed by computed tomography measurements and the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the largest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA: Recipient

        Diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, either clear cell type or non-clear cell
        type. The diagnosis must be confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology of National Cancer
        Institute (NCI) or Hackensack (there will be no central pathology review).

        The consent process will include a discussion of the potential role of high-dose
        interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy prior to protocol enrollment. High-dose IL-2 therapy is not
        widely available, but may be available on an NCI protocol (Dr. Yang) or through Dr. Alter
        for Hackensack patients. IL-2 therapy may also be administered by any other qualified
        physician; the Novartis web-site has a list of such physicians. For subjects who are
        deemed to be eligible for high-dose IL-2 and elect to receive this therapy, such subjects
        must have progressive disease post-IL-2 to enter this study; such subjects must also have
        received and have had progressive disease after therapy with one of the agents listed
        below.

        Subject must have progressive disease after therapy consisting of one of the following
        Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents: sorafenib, sunitib, or temsirolimus.

        Patients 18 - 75 years of age. Subjects older than 75 will not be enrolled due to an
        increased rate of transplant-related complications.

        Must have consenting sibling matched at 6/6 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens (A, B,
        DR).

        Patient or legal guardian must be able to give informed consent.

        All previous therapy must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry. Any grade 3
        or 4 non-hematologic toxicity of any previous therapy must have resolved to grade 2 or
        less.

        Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 80%.

        Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

        Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40% (multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA)
        or echo) within 28 days of enrollment.

        Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) greater than 50% of expected value (hemoglobin
        (Hb) corrected), obtained within 28 days of enrollment.

        Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 40 ml/min. Creatinine clearance will be
        determined by testing of a 24 hour urine collection and simultaneous serum creatinine
        value. In previous studies, the creatine clearance of patients with metastatic renal cell
        cancer who underwent nephrectomy was 53 plus or minus 19.

        Serum total bilirubin less than 2.5 mg/dl, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
        aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values less than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of
        normal. ALT and AST values above these levels may be accepted (up to a maximum of 5 times
        the upper limit of normal), at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI) or study
        chairperson, if such elevations are thought to be due to liver involvement by malignancy.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA : Donor

        Sibling who is 6/6 HLA-matched with recipient.

        Ability to give informed consent.

        Age 18 years to 80 years. Donors older than 80 will not be eligible due to potentially
        increased complications from the donation procedure.

        Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary central
        venous catheter for apheresis.

        Donors must be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative, hepatitis B surface antigen
        negative, and hepatitis C antibody negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission
        of these infections to the recipient. Donors with a history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C
        infections may be eligible. However, eligibility determination of such patients will
        require a hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility
        of transmitting hepatitis will be discussed with the patient and eligibility will then be
        determined by the principal investigator.

        A donor who is lactating must substitute formula feeding for her infant during the period
        of cytokine administration. Filgrastim may be secreted in human milk, although its
        bioavailability from this source is not known. Limited clinical data suggest that
        administration of filgrastim or to neonates is not associated with adverse outcomes.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Recipient

        Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.

        Active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy.

        HIV infection. There is theoretical concern that the degree of immune suppression
        associated with the treatment may result in progression of HIV infection.

        Chronic active hepatitis B. Patient may be hepatitis B core antibody positive. For
        patients with concomitant positive hepatitis B surface antigen, patient will require a
        hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit profile of transplant and hepatitis B will be
        discussed with the patient and eligibility determined by the principal investigator and
        protocol chairperson.

        Hepatitis C infection. Patient may have hepatitis C infection. However, each patient will
        require a hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit profile of transplant and hepatitis C
        will be discussed with the patient and eligibility determined by the principal
        investigator and protocol chairperson.

        Pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective method of
        contraception from the time of study entry to at least one year post-transplant; effective
        methods include intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or
        implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy, partner s vasectomy, or barrier methods (condom,
        diaphragm, or cervical cap). Males on the protocol, and their partners of child-bearing
        potential, must also use an effective form of contraception at study entry and for one
        year post-transplant. The effects of the chemotherapy, the subsequent transplant, and the
        medications used after the transplant are highly likely to be harmful to a fetus. The
        effects upon breast milk are also unknown and may be harmful to the infant; therefore,
        women should not breastfeed during the interval from study entry to one year
        post-transplant.

        History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant protocol,
        or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent (as determined by principal
        investigator or study chairman).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Donor

        History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant protocol,
        or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.

        History of hypertension that is not controlled by medication, stroke, or severe heart
        disease. Individuals with symptomatic angina will be considered to have severe heart
        disease and will not be eligible to be a donor.

        No other medical contraindications to stem cell donation (i.e. severe atherosclerosis,
        autoimmune disease, iritis or episcleritis, deep venous thrombosis, cerebrovascular
        accident). Patients with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty will
        receive a cardiology evaluation and be considered on a case-by-case basis.

        History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially
        curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-by-case basis. The
        risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells at
        the time of transplantation will be discussed with the patient.

        Donors must not be pregnant. The effects of cytokine therapy on a fetus are unknown.
        Donors of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception from the
        time of study entry until at least one year post-transplant.

        Anemia (Hb less than 11 gm/dl) or thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000 per
        microliter).

        <title>Clinical Regression of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (Partial Response (PR)) or Complete Remission of Tumor (Complete Response (CR))</title>
        <description>Response was assessed by computed tomography measurements and the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the largest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
