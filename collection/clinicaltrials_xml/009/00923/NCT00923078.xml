      The purpose of this study is to determine whether computer-based training of auditory and
      visual processing results in corresponding improvement in brain function in individuals with
      schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is recognized as one of the leading causes of medical disability worldwide,
      ranked 9th overall by the World Health Organization, and affects more than 2 million
      Americans per year. There is considerable evidence to suggest that disability status in
      schizophrenia relates more directly to cognitive Impairment, involving attention, reasoning,
      and memory, than to characteristic symptoms of psychosis. Accordingly, the evaluation and
      advancement of interventions designed to restore cognitive function, generally termed
      cognitive remediation, is of critical importance to our rehabilitation mission. Recent
      randomized controlled trials of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia have found moderate
      gains in cognitive function and improved outcomes in important areas of community living.
      However, despite these encouraging findings, inferences that (1) brain neuroplasticity is
      intact in schizophrenia, (2) that training effects adaptive change at the neural level, and
      (3) that change in cognitive test performance occurs through restoration of underlying
      neural substrates, have yet to be empirically evaluated. This project will begin to address
      these issues by examining the effects of computer-based cognitive training on event-related
      potential (ERP) measures of sensory information processing. Two ERP paradigms, mismatch
      negativity (MMN) and P300 generation, will be administered in auditory and visual
      modalities. MMN and P300 have been studied extensively in human neuroscience as probes of
      sensory echoic memory and attention engagement to contextually relevant information.
      Furthermore, reductions in MMN and P300 generation are reliably observed in schizophrenia,
      follow the course of a progressive neuropathological process, and correlate with severity of
      cognitive impairment. The specific aims of this study are to determine: (1) whether training
      selectively influences bottom-up (MMN) or top-down (P300) information processing, (2)
      whether training effects are modality specific (auditory vs. visual), (3) whether baseline
      MMN and P300 predict, or rate-limit, training progress, and (4) whether pre-post change in
      cognitive test performance is mediated by neural-level change in MMN and P300 generation.
      Answers to these questions will provide information needed to structure cognitive training
      for maximum benefit in schizophrenia.

    <description>The program entails six computer-based exercises that are designed to be very easy to use and require no computer experience. The exercises are calibrated to individual performance at the onset of training and adapt in difficulty to individual performance, giving constant feedback about progress. Our laboratory procedures include review of progress with the participant at the end of each session, intended to encourage motivation. Each of the six exercises focuses on a distinct process: (1) auditory processing speed, (2) discriminating sounds, (3) sound precision, (4) sound sequencing, (5) working memory, and (6) narrative memory.</description>
