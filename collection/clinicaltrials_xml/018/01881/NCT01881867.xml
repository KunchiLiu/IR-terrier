  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7
      (CYT107) after vaccine therapy works in treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate
      cancer that has spread to other areas of the body or has not responded to at least one type
      of treatment. Biological therapies, such as glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7,
      may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.
      Vaccines made from white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build an
      effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether glycosylated
      recombinant human interleukin-7 works better with or without vaccine therapy in treating
      prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced antigen-specific
      T-cell immune response to the sipuleucel-T fusion protein vaccine construct prostatic acid
      phosphatase-sargramostim (PAP-GM-CSF) (PA2024).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced antigen-specific
      T-cell immune response to PAP.

      II. To assess the character of the T-cell immune response to PAP and PA2024.

      III. To determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced
      antigen-specific antibody immune responses to PAP and PA2024.

      IV. To quantify the effects of CYT107 on T-cell repertoire diversity.

      V. To assess the effects of CYT107 on the immune competence of patients with advanced
      prostate cancer.

      VI. To assess the clinical efficacy and tolerability of sipuleucel-T plus CYT107 compared
      with sipuleucel-T alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      COHORT I: Patients receive no treatment (observation) after completion of standard
      sipuleucel-T therapy.

      COHORT II: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 subcutaneously (SC)
      every week for 4 weeks (on days 0, 7, 14, and 21) beginning 3-7 days after completion of
      standard sipuleucel-T therapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 53 weeks.
