  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate a NULOJIX® (belatacept) based regimens as a means of
      improving long-term graft function without increasing the risks of immunologic graft injury
      by avoiding both calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and corticosteroids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects,
      including kidney damage. Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to
      prevent their immune system (the body's natural defense system against illness) from
      rejecting their new kidney. Most patients who receive a kidney transplant must take these
      anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives, or for as long as the kidney
      continues to work.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if NULOJIX® (belatacept), will minimize serious
      long term side effects seen with anti-rejection medications while still protecting the
      transplanted kidney from damage. The researchers also want to learn more about the safety of
      this treatment and the long term health of the transplanted kidney.

             upon study entry;

          -  Participants with reproductive potential must agree to use an appropriate method(s)
             of birth control as outlined in the CellCept® , Myfortic® or generic package labeling
             during participation in the study and for 4 months following completion of the study;

             If documentation is not present at the time of transplantation, and the subject does
             not have any risk factors for TB, a TB-specific interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)
             may be performed.

             investigator is at increased likelihood of recurrence and which may result in rapid
             decline in renal function;

          -  Known history of thrombotic events or risk factors, including any of the following:

               -  Factor V Leiden, elevated homocysteine, positive lupus anticoagulant, elevated
                  anticardiolipin antibody, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,

               -  A family history of a heritable thrombotic condition,

        fistula, or indwelling catheter/device may not be considered an exclusion criterion.

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the
             participant's ability to comply with study requirements;

          -  Use of investigational drugs within 4 weeks of enrollment;

          -  Known hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)or any of the drug's components;
