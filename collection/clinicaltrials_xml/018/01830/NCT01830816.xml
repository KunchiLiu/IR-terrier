    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/1b, open-label, multicenter study of oral ixazomib (MLN9708)designed to
      assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single dose ixazomib in patients with normal renal
      function and in patients with severe renal impairment (RI) (according to Cockcroft-Gault
      estimates). Twenty-eight PK-evaluable patients will be enrolled in either 1 of the 2 arms of
      the study.

      Arm 1: (N = 12): Normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 90 mL/min)

      Arm 2: (N = 16): Severe RI (CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min) including at least 6 patients with ESRD,
      defined as renal failure requiring hemodialysis

    <description>In the 15 day period that constitutes Part A of the trial, patients will receive a single oral dose of ixazomib (MLN9708) capsule on Day 1.
Patients from Part A will then have the option of continuing the study by participating in Part B, starting immediately after Part A, where they will receive ixazomib (MLN9708) on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. In Part B at the discretion of the investigator, dexamethasone 40 mg may be administered to patients with RRMM on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (20 mg if &gt;75 years old) of each 28-day cycle.</description>
