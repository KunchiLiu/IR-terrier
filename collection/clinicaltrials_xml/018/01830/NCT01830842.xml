      The purpose of this study is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
      investigate the acute and chronic effects of nicotine on motivational behavior and
      prediction error-related neural activation. Nonsmokers (n = 24) and smokers (n = 24) will
      undergo fMRI scans on two separate occasions while performing a decision-making task that
      will elicit prediction error signals in the mesocorticolimbic pathway of the brain.
      Nonsmokers will be scanned once following an acute dose of nicotine and once following
      placebo administration. Smokers will be scanned once following smoking as usual and once
      following 24-hours of smoking abstinence, in order to measure the effects of nicotine
      withdrawal. The study team hypothesizes that acute nicotine will increase the prediction
      error signal in nonsmokers compared to placebo, and that nicotine withdrawal will decrease
      the prediction error signal in smokers compared to the normal satiated condition.
      Furthermore, nonsmokers (during the placebo condition) will have greater prediction error
      activation than smokers (during the satiated condition). The results of this study will
      inform whether the initiation and maintenance of smoking behavior could be facilitated by
      the effects of nicotine on reinforcement learning.
