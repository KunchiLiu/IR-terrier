    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety and the dose of the combination of INC280 and buparlisib
      (BKM120), as well as the anti-tumor activity of the combination, in patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma with PTEN mutations, homozygous deletion of PTEN or PTEN negative by IHC. In
      addition, the anti-tumor activity of INC280 single agent will be assessed in patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma with c-Met alteration.

      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/II study. The aim of the phase Ib part is to
      estimate the MTD and/or to identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination
      of INC280 and buparlisib, followed by the phase II part to assess the clinical efficacy of
      INC280 single agent and in combination with buparlisib (BKM120), and to further assess the
      safety of the combination. A maximum of 10 patients (in the combination arm) and approx. 5
      patients (in the single agent arm), who have received bevacizumab treatment before entering
      the study, will be enrolled in the phase II part. In addition, a surgical arm will start
      concurrently with the phase II part, to determine the PK/PD profile of the study drug
      combination in patients undergoing tumor resection for recurrent glioblastoma after 7 to
      10-days treatment.
