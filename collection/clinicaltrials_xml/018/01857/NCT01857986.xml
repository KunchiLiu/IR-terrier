    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to assess the effectiveness of the AnapnoGaurd 100 system relative to
      standard of care (SOC) Control, in the course of mechanical ventilation and intubation. The
      main effectiveness aspect of this trial is the AnapnoGaurd 100's ability to reduce leaks
      between the endotracheal tube and the trachea walls as a result of the cuff pressure
      management. Since the primary outcome can't be measured by any method other than the
      investigational device, the study groups will be treated as follows:

        -  The Treatment group in this study will be treated with the fully functional AnapnoGaurd
           100 device (per its intended use),

        -  The Control group will be treated with the AnapnoGuard device, where the cuff control
           will be disabled (off) and the cuff management will be done according to SOC.

      Effectiveness will be measured by the duration and level of carbon dioxide (CO2) leakage
      around the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff, from the lungs to the subglottic space and safety
      will be measured by adverse events (AEs).

In the control group, the cuff pressure control of the AnapnoGuard 100 control unit will be disabled (OFF). CO2 level above the cuff will be recorded. Suction and rinsing function will operate after the system detects no CO2.</description>
