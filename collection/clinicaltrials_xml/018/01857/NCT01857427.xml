  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to build a well characterized cohort of patients that
      will be used to determine the genetic variants associated with obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA)and its co-morbidities.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of building the cohort is to allow the performance of genome-wide association
      studies with a large sample of patients that have been well-characterized using standardized
      procedures.

        Adult subjects 18 years of age and older who are scheduled for polysomnography (PSG),
        regardless of final diagnosis AND adult subjects who have already been diagnosed with OSA
        based on a prior PSG and are already on treatment. OSA diagnosis will be defined as an
        apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;or =5 episodes per hour.
