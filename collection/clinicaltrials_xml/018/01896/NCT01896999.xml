      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab when
      given together with brentuximab vedotin in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma that has
      returned after a period of improvement or has not responded to previous treatment.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Brentuximab vedotin is a combining monoclonal antibody with
      an anticancer drug that binds to a protein on the surface of lymphoma cells called cluster
      of differentiation (CD)30 and may kill the cells. Giving ipilimumab or nivolumab or both
      with brentuximab vedotin may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of the
      combinations of brentuximab vedotin and ipilimumab, brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab, and
      brentuximab vedotin, ipilimumab, and nivolumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate complete response (CR) rate, partial response (PR) rate and overall response
      rate (ORR), for the combinations of brentuximab vedotin and ipilimumab, brentuximab vedotin
      and nivolumab, and brentuximab vedotin, ipilimumab, and nivolumab.

      II. To evaluate the duration of remission (DOR) to these combinations and compare with the
      DOR achieved with the most recent prior systemic therapy.

      III. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS) in
      patients receiving the combination of brentuximab vedotin and ipilimumab, brentuximab
      vedotin and nivolumab, and brentuximab vedotin, ipilimumab, and nivolumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the ability of these combinations to alter tumor specific T cell immunity.

      II. To evaluate the effects of these combinations on systemic immunity. III. To evaluate a
      panel of cytokine and T cell specific biomarkers from the peripheral blood as a potential
      immune signature of treatment response to therapy with these combinations for patients with
      relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

      IV. To evaluate using gene expression profiling (GEP) a signature of response to these novel
      combinations of an antibody drug conjugate with immunomodulatory therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab and nivolumab. Patients are assigned
      to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 of courses
      1-4, 8, 12, and 16 and brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 90 minutes and nivolumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 30 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of course 1 and then every
      12 weeks for up to 9 doses. Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 90 minutes on day 1
      and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment with brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab
      repeats every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 30 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 3 years.
