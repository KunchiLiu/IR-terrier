  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-institution, Phase Ia/Ib/IIa open-label, dose-finding, safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and proof-of-concept study of GDC-0810 as a single agent and in
      combination with palbociclib and/or LHRH agonist. The study is divided into 3 phases: Phase
      Ia, Phase Ib, and Phase IIa. During Phase Ia (dose escalation phase), GDC-0810 single agent
      will be administered orally on a continuous daily dosing regimen with a Day -7 lead-in
      period for single dose PK evaluation prior to the start of daily treatment. The incidence of
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be evaluated from Day -7 through the first cycle (28
      days) of treatment (35 days total). Depending on safety and tolerability, participants will
      be assigned sequentially to escalating doses of GDC-0810 using standard 3 + 3 design. During
      Phase Ib (dose escalation and expansion phase), participants will receive GDC-0810 with
      palbociclib and/or LHRH agonist to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and assess
      the safety and tolerability of concomitant administration. During Phase IIa (dose expansion
      phase), participants previously treated with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) will be treated at
      the RP2D to further characterize the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity
      of GDC-0810.

Dose escalation will be performed in Cohorts C1 and C2. In Cohort C3, participants will receive the RP2D of GDC-0810 in combination with palbociclib identified in during dose escalation and participants may also receive LHRH every 4 weeks. In Cohort D1 and Cohort D2, GDC-0810 600 mg will be administered orally on Days 1 to 28 of a 28-day schedule and an LHRH agonist administered monthly. Treatments will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent (up to 3 years).</description>
