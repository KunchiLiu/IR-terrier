      The purpose of this study is to compare the imaging performance of an investigational breast
      computed tomography (CT) scanner, built at UC Davis, with that of an FDA-Approved breast
      tomosynthesis scanner (capable of producing standard 2-D mammography and 3-D tomosynthesis
      images), built by Hologic, Incorporated, in a group of patients with suspected breast
      cancer.

      The primary aim of this study is the comparison of tumor conspicuity on images taken by both
      systems (computed tomography versus standard 2-D mammography versus 3-D tomosynthesis) using
      a ten point conspicuity scale as the end-point. Secondary aims will be to compare the number
      of lesions detected by the two systems, and to compare the estimated radiation dose of the
      two systems.
