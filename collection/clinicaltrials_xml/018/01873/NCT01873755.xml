  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will address the existent gaps in the literature by identifying barriers and
      facilitators to participation in physical activity in inner-city minority elementary
      schoolchildren with asthma, more that half of whom are also overweight; developing and
      refining a school-based intervention in partnership with the community to improve physical
      activity; and conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial of the intervention to
      determine feasibility and obtain preliminary data for a future large-scale trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four schools have been recruited for pilot wait-listed cluster randomized clinical trial to
      determine feasibility for a large-scaled trial. Community-based participatory research
      approach was utilized to develop an intervention that will be delivered to two schools. Two
      control schools will receive intervention during year 2 of the study.
