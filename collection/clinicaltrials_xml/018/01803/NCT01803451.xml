  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms by which gastric bypass
      surgery improves glucose metabolism.

      The central hypothesis guiding this project is that the reconfiguration of intestinal
      transit with the Roux-en-Y will increase the release of insulinotropic GI hormones, termed
      incretins that improve insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. The study is divided into
      three specific aims.

        1. To determine the role of incretin hormones on insulin secretion in patients with
           gastric bypass surgery using intravenous-oral hyperglycemic clamp.

        2. To compare incretin effect and glucose tolerance among patient who suffer from
           hypoglycemia after RYGB and asymptomatic surgical and non-surgical individuals.

        3. To quantify the contribution of GLP-1 to incretin effect enhancement following surgery.
