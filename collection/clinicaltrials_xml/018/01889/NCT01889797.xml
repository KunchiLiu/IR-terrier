    <textblock>
      Patients with previously untreated low tumor burden indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)
      will receive either rituximab or GA101 weekly for 4 weeks followed by re-staging to
      determine response.

      Rituximab, an anti-CD20 chimeric antibody, was approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration in 1998 for the treatment of patients with relapsed low-grade B-cell
      lymphomas. Clinically, four weekly doses of rituximab have proven to be well tolerated and
      effective in previously untreated as well as relapsed patients with low-grade lymphoma.

      GA101 is an anti-CD20 humanized and glyco-engineered monoclonal antibody. GA101 has been
      shown to have increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and direct
      cell-death induction compared to Rituximab. It is possible that GA101 may have greater
      efficacy than rituximab.

      PrE0401 Sub-Study Evaluation of Corrected QT (QTc) Interval and Pharmacokinetic Parameters
      in Patients Participating in GA101 (Obinutuzumab)

      Approximately twenty-five patients randomized to GA101 may participate in the sub-study.
      Electrocardiograms and blood samples will be obtained.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that approximately 70,800
      individuals will be diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and over 18,990 men and
      women will die of the disease in 2014. The survival rates for patients with indolent NHL
      remained unchanged from the 1950s through the early 1990s, but recent evidence suggests that
      outcomes are improving. Indolent NHL is a particular challenge because it is an incurable
      disease requiring multiple treatments; yet relatively long survivals elevate the importance
      of quality of life associated with treatment.

      Agents such as rituximab are active in patients with a low burden of disease and result in
      high response rates and durable remissions for most patients. However, the optimal
      therapeutic approach to patients with low-grade lymphoma with a low disease burden is
      controversial as conventional chemotherapy also results in high rates of response.
      Regardless of whether patients receive immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination
      thereof, they unfortunately exhibit a continuing pattern of disease relapse and the median
      survival for newly diagnosed patients is between 7-10 years.

      Rituximab and GA101 both target the CD20 antigen. The CD20 antigen is located on the surface
      of normal and malignant B-cell lymphocytes. An attractive feature of this target is that
      CD20 is not on hematopoietic stem cells, nor is it expressed in any great extent on other
      normal body tissues.

      Studies in vitro have shown that rituximab predominantly induces antibody dependent cellular
      cytotoxicity (ADCC), but also binds complement and directly induces apoptosis in lymphoma
      cells.

      GA101 shows increased ADCC related to an improved binding of the GA101 to the different
      allotypes expressed by natural killer cells and monocytes. It also has increased direct
      cell-death related to an elbow hinge amino acid exchange and Type II binding of the CD20
      epitope. The safety of GA101 in NHL so far appears to be similar to that observed with
      rituximab in patients with NHL, except for a higher incidence of infusion-related reactions.

      Depletion of malignant B-cells using anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies has an acceptable
      safety profile, particularly in patients with low-grade B-cell lymphomas with a low disease
      burden. To determine whether treatment with GA101 results in better outcomes than that seen
      with rituximab and to determine which anti-CD20 antibody to utilize in future studies, we
      will conduct a randomized Phase II trial of rituximab and GA101 in patients with previously
      untreated low-grade lymphoma. Patients will receive either rituximab or GA101 weekly for 4
      weeks followed by re-staging. The endpoints of the study will be the Complete Response (CR),
      Overall Response Rate (ORR), time to next treatment, progression free survival (PFS), and
      safety of each treatment arm.

      PrE0401 Sub-Study Evaluation of Corrected QT (QTc) Interval and Pharmacokinetic Parameters
      in Patients Participating in GA101 (Obinutuzumab)

      Patients randomized to GA101 and who consent to the sub-study will have electrocardiograms
      obtained pre and post Week 1 and Week 4 to investigate the effect of GA101 on QTc interval.
      Pharmacokinetic blood samples will also be done to evaluate serum concentrations of GA101 at
      the same time-points.
