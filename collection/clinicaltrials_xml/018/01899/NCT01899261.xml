  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients
      with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Stereotactic radiation therapy may be
      able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate feasibility and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of the
      liver for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate radiographic local response, local control and time to local progression
      (TTLP) of treated lesions in HCC patients after liver SBRT.

      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) and cancer specific survival (CSS) in HCC patients
      treated with liver SBRT.

      III. To evaluate explanted irradiated liver tissue (for patients who proceed to liver
      transplantation) to determine extent of residual tumor and extent of radiation effects
      within and around the irradiated field.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT every other day over 2 weeks (5 fractions total) in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
      and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.
