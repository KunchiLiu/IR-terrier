  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine use disorders are an unrelenting public health concern. Intensive research
      efforts have yielded behavioral interventions that reduce methamphetamine use, however,
      these interventions are not universally effective and treatment effects diminish over time.
      Development of a pharmacotherapy that enhances the efficacy of these interventions is a
      priority for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. This study proposes to determine the
      impact of buspirone maintenance on self-administration of methamphetamine. These preliminary
      data will be used to support further research developing buspirone as a pharmacotherapy for
      methamphetamine use disorders. The investigators hypothesize that buspirone will attenuate
      the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine.

    <measure>Reinforcing Effects of Methamphetamine During Buspirone Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>After at least 6 days of buspirone maintenance</time_frame>
    <description>The reinforcing effects of methamphetamine will be determined during buspirone treatment using a modified progressive ratio procedure in which subjects are offered the opportunity to earn previously sampled doses of methamphetamine. Each ratio completed on the task will earn 1/10th of the sampled dose.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>6 sessions over approximately 3 week inpatient admissions</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete subjective effects measures during six sessions while they are admitted to our inpatient unit. These items will ask about drug effects and general mood.</description>

    <measure>Physiological and Side Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily over approximately 3 week inpatient admission</time_frame>
    <description>Physiological and side effects measures will be completed daily while subjects are admitted to our inpatient unit. Physiological measures include heart rate and blood pressure. Side Effects questions will query subjects about common effects of centrally active medications.</description>
