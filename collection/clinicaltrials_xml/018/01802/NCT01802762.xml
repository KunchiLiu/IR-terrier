    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of a new neuromonitoring system (NeMoSystem including NeMo Probe
      and NeMo Patch) and the accuracy of the measurement values (cerebral blood flow (CBF);
      cerebral blood volume (CBV)) obtained.

    <measure>To assess the feasibility of the neuromonitoring system and the accuracy of the measurement values.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 after removal of medical device</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility:
User acceptance: For NeMo Probes in comparison to conventional probes for intracranial pressure (ICP-) monitoring; for NeMo Patch in comparison to patches for electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring.
Detailled evaluation of user acceptance:
Incidence of concerns of users in relation to the installation, function and removal of the NeMo System (= NeMo Probe, NeMo Patch, NeMo Control Unit and NeMo Software pre-installed on a Medical PC)
User-friendliness with a 3-graded scale (equal, better, worse) compared to conventional devices
Accuracy of measurements:
-Patients: Results from repeated measurements of mean transit time of ICG (mttICG), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV)
Safety parameters:
Incidence of complications (infections, brain tissue damage, haemorrhage) compared to historical series (patches for EEG and for BIS measurements; conventional probes for ICP monitoring)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To demonstrate the ability of the neuromonitoring system to detect secondary ischemic events in patients with severe subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 after removal of medical device</time_frame>
    <description>Results concerning sensitivity and specificity to detect symptomatic vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (correlation of events with CBF values &lt; 15 ml/100g/min with defined criteria for vasospasm) Results concerning sensitivity and specificity to detect secondary infarctions and critical ICP values in TBI patients (correlation of events with CBF values &lt; 15 ml/100g/min with defined criteria for secondary infarction) Results from repeated measurements for the difference between measurement values obtained with the NeMo Patch and the NeMo Probe, quantified with mathematical models</description>
