    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) of Treatment and Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>SPID was calculated as the weighted sum of pain intensity differences at 4 hours post dose. Pain intensity at each time point was calculated as difference of pain intensity at baseline with pain intensity at a given time point. n=number of participants analyzed in respective treatment arm for this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) of Other Treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2, and 3 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>SPID at each time point was calculated as weighted sum of pain intensity differences at baseline with pain intensity at a given time point. n= number of participants analyzed in respective treatment arm for this outcome measure varies over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Meaningful Headache Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Time to meaningful headache relief was assessed as time when participants reported a PRS â‰¥ 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2, 3 and 4 hour post dose</time_frame>
    <description>TOTPAR was calculated as the weighted sum of pain relief scores of PRS at each time point with time interval between any two time points being used. n= number of participants analyzed in respective treatment arm for this outcome measure varies over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Time-Response Curve for Change in Headache Intensity and Headache Relief (SPRID)</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2, 3 and 4 hour post dose</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID was measured as sum of TOTPAR and SPID.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Evaluation of Response to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Global evaluation of treatment response was measured by a score in a scale from: 0-very poor, 1-poor, 2-neutral [neither poor nor good], 3-good, or 4-very good).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants that took rescue medication over the total number of participants for a given treatment group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Headache Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min.</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in headache pain intensity was calculated as the change (difference) from baseline pain intensity with pain intensity at each time-point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Headache Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min. 15 min., 20 min., 25 min., 30 min., 40 min., 50 min., 60 min., 90 min., 120 min., 180 min., 240 min.,</time_frame>
    <description>Headache Relief was measured as PRS over the time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Pain Free Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour and 2 hour post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with complete relief was calculated as the ratio of number of participants that reported PRS = 4 over the total number of participants for a given treatment group.</description>
