    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Straumann Bone
      Level Ø 3.3 mm NC SLActive Roxolid Implants compared to Straumann Bone Level Ø 4.1 mm RC
      SLActive Roxolid Implants based on mean crestal bone level changes measured between surgery
      and 12 months post-implant placement. The secondary objectives will assess differences in
      clinical outcomes between the test and control implants, including implant success and
      survival, gingival recession, subject satisfaction and additional early bone level
      measurements.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical study. The total study duration for
      each patient should be 12 ± 1 months.

      Straumann Bone Level implants will be placed in the pre-molar or anterior region of the
      mandible or maxilla for single tooth replacement, followed by provisional prosthetic loading
      after 25 ± 4 days and by final prosthetic loading 6 ± 1 months after implant loading.

      In total 6 visits per patient are scheduled in this study. Bone level changes, implant
      success and survival, gingival recession, subject satisfaction and adverse events (AEs) will
      be assessed.

      The study devices are CE-(Conformité Européenne, meaning European Conformity) marked
      products. Straumann Bone Level implants Ø 3.3 mm NC SLActive Roxolid and Straumann Bone
      Level Ø 4.1 mm RC SLActive implants.

      Five centers in USA will participate.
