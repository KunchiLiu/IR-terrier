    <textblock>
      Conceptually, awareness of pressure occurs only during wakefulness. Thus reducing the
      pressure during wakefulness may improve therapy comfort and potentially adherence without
      compromizing therapy efficacy. SensAwake™ is a unique pressure relief technology developed
      by Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare which detects irregularity in the flow signal indicative of
      the transition from sleep to wake. When the transition from sleep to wake is detected the
      device promptly reduces the pressure to help facilitate a return to sleep.

      The purpose of this study is to compare adherence and sleep quality outcomes in patients
      treated by CPAP with and without SensAwake technology.

      It is hypothesised that participants with SensAwake on will have improved adherence and
      sleep quality.

          -  Any known factor or disease that might interfere with treatment adherence, study
             conduct or interpretation of the results such as severe psychiatric disease, history
             of non adherence to medical regimens, or unwillingness to comply with study
             requirements as determined by the principal investigator.
