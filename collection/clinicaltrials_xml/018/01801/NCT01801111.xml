  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter phase I/II study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of RO5424802 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have ALK mutation and
      failed crizotinib treatment. In Part 1, cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of
      RO5424802 orally twice daily. In Part 2, patients will receive the recommended phase II dose
      of RO5424802 as determined in Part 1. Treatment will continue in Part 1 and Part 2 on the
      same dose until disease progression. In Part 3, following disease progression, patients
      without EGFR mutation will be offered continued treatment with RO5424802, patients with EGFR
      mutations will be offered a combination of RO5424802 and Tarceva (erlotinib).

      <pre_assignment_details>Part 1 of study was planned to determine recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of alectinib to be used in Part 2. During the conduct of Part 1 for this study, RP2D was confirmed in Study NP28761 (NCT01871805). Hence Part 1 participants were merged into Part 2. Part 3 was post-progression treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Objective response was assessed by IRC according to RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target, non-target lesions; normalization of tumor marker level and all lymph nodes size was &lt;10 mm.

CR and PR was to be confirmed by repeat assessments ≥4 weeks after initial documentation.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline; assessments every 8 week post-baseline until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, death, other reason deemed by investigator; then survival follow-up; data until cutoff (18 August 2014) are reported, maximum 53 weeks</time_frame>

        <description>Objective response was assessed by investigator according to RECIST version 1.1.

        <description>Objective response was assessed by IRC according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target, non-target lesions; normalization of tumor marker level and all lymph nodes size was &lt;10 millimeter (mm).

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Objective Response (CR or PR) of Baseline Central Nervous System (CNS) Lesions As Assessed by IRC Based on Radiology Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Criteria</title>
        <description>Objective response (CR and PR) of CNS lesions was assessed based on IRC review of radiographs by RANO criteria. CR was achieved if all of the following criteria met: Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-measurable disease; Stable or improved non-enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions; No new lesions; Participant must be off corticosteroids (or on physiologic replacement doses only), and clinically stable or improved. PR was achieved if all of the following criteria met: at least 50% decrease compared with screening in the sum of the products of the diameters (SPD) of measurable enhancing measurable lesions; No progression of non-measurable disease (enhancing and non-enhancing [T2/FLAIR] lesions); No new lesions; Participant must be off corticosteroids (or on physiologic replacement doses only), and clinically stable or improved. For both CR and PR, responses had to be sustained for at least 4 weeks.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline; assessments every 8 week post-baseline until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, death, other reason deemed by investigator; then survival follow-up; data until cutoff (18 August 2014) are reported, maximum 53 weeks</time_frame>

        <title>Duration of Response in Participants With CNS Response (CR or PR) as Assessed by IRC Based on RECIST</title>
        <description>Duration of response in participants with CNS response was defined as the time from the first observation of a CNS response (CR or PR) until first observation of CNS progression or death from any cause based on IRC review of radiographs by RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the screening sum diameters) and no progression of target lesions. Progression was defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to smallest sum of diameters on-study or absolute increase of at lease 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesion. Duration of response was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and 95% CI was assessed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>
