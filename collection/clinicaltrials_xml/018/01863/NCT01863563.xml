      Hemostasis will be achieved during Pediatric Tonsillectomy/Adenoidectomy with the use of
      QuickClot.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Quickclot dressing contains Kaolin, a natural mineral that promotes the body's clotting
      process. This dressing will be applied for one minute to the area where the tonsils/adenoids
      were. The investigators are hoping to develop a standard of practice where Quickclot is a
      key addition for tonsillectomy surgery.

    <description>After removal of the adenoids, a tonsil pack wrapped in QuikClot will be placed in the nasopharynx. The investigators will then perform tonsillectomy with the Microdebrider. A QuikClot roll will be placed in the tonsil fossa, and pressure applied via tonsil sponge for one minute. The contralateral tonsil will then be addressed with the same technique. The QuikClot adenoid pack is then removed and residual adenoidal bleeding is addressed with suction electrocautery, followed by placement of a second QuikClot adenoid pack. The tonsil rolls are sequentially removed, followed by control of residual hemostasis with suction electrocautery. A second set of tonsil rolls are placed. After adenoid pack is removed from nasopharynx and bleeding controlled, tonsil rolls are removed, followed by suction electrocautery for any residual hemostasis is performed.</description>
