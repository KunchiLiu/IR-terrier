      Background:

      - GS-7977, GS-5885, GS-9669, and GS-9451 are new drugs for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection. GS-7977 may help treat the infection when used with other treatments like
      interferon therapy. GS-5885, and GS-9669, and GS-9451 also lower the amount of HCV in the
      body. Researchers want to see whether GS-7977 can be combined with any of the other three
      drugs to treat HCV infection. Some participants will take GS-7977 and GS-5885. Others will
      take GS-7977, GS-5885 and GS-9669 or GS-7977, GS-5885 and GS-9451.

      Objectives:

      - To see whether GS-7977 with GS-5885 alone or in combination with either GS-9669 or 9451
      can be used to treat HCV infection.

      Eligibility:

      Individuals at least 18 years of age who have chronic HCV infection and have never been
      treated for it.

      Individuals at least 18 years of age who have chronic HCV infection and have not responded
      to interferon therapy.

      Individuals at least 18 years of age who have chronic HCV infection with advanced liver
      disease and have never been treated for HCV

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will
      be collected. A liver biopsy may also be performed.

      Some participants will take the two study drugs and some will take three study drugs. Those
      who take GS-7977 and GS-5885 will have one daily tablet named fixed dose combination or FDC.
      Those who take GS-7977 and CS-9669 will have three daily tablets taken once daily. Those who
      take GS-7977 and GS-5885 and GS-9451 will take 2 pills once a day. GS-7977 and GS-5885 will
      be combined in one pill and GS-9451 will be in another pill.

      Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests. These tests will check liver function
      and the level of HCV infection. Participants may have other blood tests as needed for
      treatment.

      Participants will have 6, 8, or 12 weeks of treatment depending on which study drugs are
      scheduled to take. After they complete their schedule, they will stop treatment with the
      study drugs. They may also have another liver biopsy.

      Participants will have regular follow-up visits over the next 48 weeks. They will have
      physical exams and provide blood samples....

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem with an estimated
      180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States an estimated 4.1 million people
      are infected, and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading
      indication for liver transplantation. While treatment with ribavirin (RBV) and pegylated
      interferon (PEG) in combination with boceprevir/telaprevir is the currently recommended
      therapy for chronic HCV infection and has superior cure rates compared to PEG+RBV alone in
      HCV monoinfected patients, treatment is still associated with a high incidence of adverse
      events (AEs), discontinuations, and poor cure rates in several populations. Recent studies
      have demonstrated that the use of a combination of antivirals, which target HCV without
      interferon (IFN), can cure HCV without additional toxicities. However, the determinants of
      response to IFN-free regimens have not been established.

      This is an open label study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment
      with GS-7977 with GS-5885, alone or in combination with GS-9669 and/or GS-9451 (selective
      HCV nucleotide NS5B, NS5A, nonnucleotide NS5B and NS3 inhibitors, respectively) in HCV
      infected treatment na(SqrRoot) ve and treatment experienced patients with early and advanced
      liver disease. The findings from this study will aid in our understanding of determinants of
      response to an IFN-free regimen in HCV infected patients for both patients with early and
      advanced liver disease as well as in patients who are treatment na(SqrRoot) ve and those who
      have been treated before for HCV.
