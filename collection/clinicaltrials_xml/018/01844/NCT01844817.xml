  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the overall survival in patients with previously
      untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus OGX-427 or
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pancreatic cancer usually present with inoperable disease and systemic therapy
      becomes the primary form of treatment. The combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel
      represents an appropriate front-line standard of care for patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. However, poor outcomes with this disease warrant exploration of novel
      drugs with unique mechanisms of action. Preclinical evidence suggests that OGX-427 has shown
      promising activity in pancreatic cancer. In this trial, we will compare the overall survival
      of patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer using OGX-427 with either
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or a placebo with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.
