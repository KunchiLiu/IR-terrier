  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of MatriStem devices
      compared to cellular dermal replacement tissue, for the treatment of non-healing diabetic
      foot ulcers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to their characteristically poor healing capacity, diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are
      challenging for clinicians to treat. This prospective, multi-center clinical study will
      examine outcomes following treatment of DFUs, with one of two FDA cleared tissue-engineered
      devices, MatriStemÂ® or cellular dermal replacement tissue, on DFUs that have demonstrated an
      inadequate response to initial standard of care therapy. The incidence of ulcer closure,
      rate of wound closure, and quality of life will be evaluated over a eight week period.
