    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study of oral dacomitinib given every 12 hours over days 1-4 of each
      two-week cycle to patients with Non-small cell lung cancer. The study includes two groups of
      patients, those whose tumor has a documented T790M mutation, and those without this
      mutation. All patients will receive repeated cycles of dacomitinib until disease
      progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria are met.

    <measure>Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with best overall response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1. Complete Response are defined as disappearance of all non-nodal lesions (target and/or non-target) without new lesions. All lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &quot;normal&quot; size (&lt;10mm). Partial Response are those with at least 30% decrease in sum of the diameters of target lesions (short diameter for target nodes and longest diameter for other target lesions) taking as a reference the baseline sum diameters, with absence of new lesions and persistence of any non target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits. Best Overall Response of Stable Disease may be assigned when response cannot be confirmed given minimum criteria for Stable Disease duration is met.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with Overall Response based assessment of confirmed complete response or confirmed partial response according to RECIST 1.1. Confirmed response are those that persist on repeat imaging assessment at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response and before progression. Complete Response are defined as disappearance of all non-nodal lesions (target and/or non-target) without new lesions. All lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &quot;normal&quot; size (&lt;10mm). Partial Response are those with at least 30% decrease in sum of the diameters of target lesions (short diameter for target nodes and longest diameter for other target lesions) taking as a reference the baseline sum diameters, with absence of new lesions and persistence of any non target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>

    <measure>Disease Control Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of study drug until RECIST defined progressive disease, or discontinuation from treatment, or start of another anti-cancer treatment assessed up to 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For patients in Cohort A, Disease Control is the best response of Complete Response, Partial Response or Stable Disease from the start of treatment until disease progression according to the RECIST v1.1 guidelines. Disease Control Rate is calculated as the proportion of patients with an objective response or Stable Diseases relative to the total number of patients enrolled.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to disease progression or death due to any cause or discontinuation from the treatment or start of a new anti-cancer treatment assessed up to 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For patients in Cohort A, Duration of Response is defined as the time from first documentation of response (Complete Response or Partial Response whichever occurs first) to the date of disease progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to disease progression or death due to any cause or discontinuation from the treatment or start of a new anti-cancer treatment assessed up to 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the date of first dosing of dacomitinib to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival at 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to disease progression or death due to any cause or discontinuation from the treatment or start of a new anti-cancer treatment assessed up to 78 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival at 4 months is defined as the proportion of patients who are alive without disease progression at 4 months relative to all patients enrolled.</description>
