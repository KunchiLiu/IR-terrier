    <textblock>
      Determining the cost effectiveness of two methods of wiring the jaws together during surgery
      to repair mandible fractures. One technique is more expensive but faster in application,
      while the other is less expensive and takes more time to apply.

      Purpose:

      To identify which option of wiring the jaws together during treatment of mandible fractures
      is more cost effective to the patient, Erich arch bars or IMF (Intermaxillary Fixation)
      screws. Patients who sustain mandible fractures that meet the inclusion criteria will be
      randomized to one of the two treatment types listed above. The overall treatment in both
      categories is consistent with the standard of care, the only difference being the method
      utilized to achieve intermaxillary fixation during the course of the surgery.
