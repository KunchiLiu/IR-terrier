      The objective of this trial is 1) to evaluate the safety and clinical acceptability of a
      5-day course of mupirocin applied every 8 hours (± 2 hours) to the nares, umbilical and
      perianal areas of infants residing in the ICU. 2) to examine the efficacy of mupirocin in
      eradicating SA colonization of infants in the ICU, defined as the absence of SA in cultures
      of the nares, umbilical, and perianal areas on day 8 (± 2) (primary decolonization) 3) to
      examine the efficacy of mupirocin in achieving persistent eradication of SA colonization
      among infants residing in the ICU,defined as the absence of SA in cultures of the nares,
      umbilical, and perianal areas. Duration is 36 months. Enrolled infants will continue to
      receive medical care as they otherwise would if they were not enrolled in the trial. The
      study will be powered with a primary endpoint with 126 participants. Enrollment may continue
      to 500 participants to power secondary and exploratory endpoints and assist design
      subsequent studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open label, multi-center, randomized trial to determine the safety and
      efficacy of mupirocin in eradicating colonization with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and
      preventing the occurrence of invasive and other clinically significant SA infections among
      critically ill infants in the ICU. Infants hospitalized in an ICU at any one of the 6
      participating centers with a positive nasal culture for SA will be eligible to enroll.
      Infants will be stratified by birth gestational age (&lt; 28 weeks and &lt;8 weeks of post-natal
      life or &gt; /= 28 weeks / &lt; 28 weeks and &gt; /=8 weeks of post-natal life) and colonizing strain
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
      aureus (MSSA) and then randomized 1:1 to receive a 5 day course of mupirocin applied to the
      nares, umbilicus and perianal (NUP) areas every 8 hours (+/= 2 hours) vs. no treatment.
      (Stratification by birth gestational age is performed to minimize bias that could result
      from a higher risk for developing infection due to prematurity or prolonged length of stay
      due to prematurity.) The primary objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate the safety and
      clinical acceptability of a 5-day course of mupirocin applied every 8 hours (± 2 hours) to
      the nares, umbilical and perianal areas of infants residing in the ICU 2) to examine the
      efficacy of mupirocin in eradicating SA colonization of infants in the ICU, defined as the
      absence of SA in cultures of the nares, umbilical, and perianal areas on day 8 (± 2)
      (primary decolonization) 3) to examine the efficacy of mupirocin in achieving persistent
      eradication of SA colonization among infants residing in the ICU, defined as the absence of
      SA in cultures of the nares, umbilical, and perianal areas on days 8 (±2) and 22 (±2)
      (persistent decolonization). The secondary objectives of this study are to 1) To examine the
      efficacy of mupirocin in preventing clinical SA infection during days 1-22 or until
      discharge, whichever occurs first, among SA colonized infants who are residing in the ICU 2)
      To compare time until SA decolonization between the mupirocin and placebo groups: Time from
      Day 1 until the first NUP collection with no SA is detected in the nares, umbilical, and
      perianal areas 3) To examine whether mupirocin affects the frequency of non-SA clinical
      infections by comparing the frequency of these infections in the treatment and control
      groups during the 85 day observation period 4) To examine whether mupirocin affects the
      frequency of severe (stage II-III) necrotizing enterocolitis by comparing the frequency of
      occurrence in the treatment and control groups during the 85 day observation period.

      Each participant will be enrolled for up to 12 weeks (Day 85) or until the time of discharge
      from the hospital, death or withdrawal from further participation, whichever occurs first.
      It is anticipated that it will take at least 2 years to enroll all participants. Study
      duration is 36 months. Enrolled infants will continue to receive medical care as they
      otherwise would if they were not enrolled in the trial. The study will be powered toward the
      primary endpoint with 126 participants. Enrollment may continue up to a maximum of 500
      participants to inform the secondary and exploratory endpoints and to help design any
      subsequent study.
