      This is a study of ruxolitinib in combination with gemcitabine with or without
      nab-paclitaxel administered to patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The
      study will be conducted in two parts.

      Part 1 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      ruxolitinib when given as described to patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic
      cancer. A goal of Part 1 will be to identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of
      ruxolitinib when given with gemcitabine with or without nab-paclitaxel. This dose will be
      selected for use in Part 2 of the study.

      Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary
      clinical activity of ruxolitinib at the dose defined in Part 1 used in combination with
      gemcitabine with or without nab-paclitaxel in subjects with advanced or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, 18 years or older

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1

          -  Requirements for prior therapy as outlined below:

               -  Enrollment into Regimen A: received no more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen
                  for advanced or metastatic disease (not including neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant
                  therapy)

               -  Enrollment into Regimen B: received no prior chemotherapy for advanced or
                  metastatic disease (not including neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy)

          -  Adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function without blood product or
             hematopoietic growth factor support:

          -  Ongoing radiation therapy and/or radiation therapy administered within 28 days of

             study drug occurred within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to
             first dose.

          -  Current or previous other malignancy within 2 years of study entry, except cured
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix, or other noninvasive malignancy without sponsor approval.

          -  Inability to swallow food or any condition of the upper GI tract that precludes
             administration of oral medications.

          -  Recent (≤ 3 months) history of partial or complete bowel obstruction.

          -  Unwilling to be transfused with blood components.
