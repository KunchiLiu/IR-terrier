  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white
      blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then
      giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes,
      or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. This
      study will use chemotherapy to prepare the immune system before this white blood cell
      treatment. After receiving the cells, the drug aldesleukin (IL-2) may be given to help the
      cells stay alive longer.

      Objectives:

      - To see if chemotherapy and white blood cell therapy is a safe and effective treatment for
      advanced ocular melanoma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least greater than or equal to 16 years to less than or equal to 75 years
      who have advanced ocular melanoma.

      Design:

        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and
           undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests
           as needed.

        -  Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo
           surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.

        -  Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood
           cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells
           from the patient.}

        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital
           for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the
           hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

        -  Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side
           effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every
           6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2
           days.

      Background:

        -  Metastatic ocular melanoma (OM) carries a poor prognosis with estimated survival of 4-6
           months. There are no known effective systemic therapies. Metastatic OM is classified as
           an orphan disease and there are currently few clinical trial options for these
           patients. Thus, novel systemic approaches are desperately needed.

        -  Administration of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) generated from
           resected metastatic cutaneous melanoma can induce objective long-term tumor responses.

        -  Minimally invasive, safe, and effective surgical approaches have been developed in the
           Surgery Branch to procure liver tumor tissue for TIL generation.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether autologous Young TIL infused with or without the administration of
           high-dose aldesleukin may result in clinical tumor regression in patients with
           metastatic ocular melanoma receiving a non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative
           regimen.

        -  To study immunologic correlates associated with Young TIL therapy for ocular melanoma.

        -  To determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with metastatic ocular melanoma who are greater than or equal to 16 years of
           age, and are physically able to tolerate non-myeloablative chemotherapy. Patients who
           can tolerate high-dose aldesleukin will receive it following cell infusion; those who
           cannot tolerate high-dose aldesleukin due to medical comorbidities or refuse high dose
           aldesleukin will receive cell infusion without aldesleukin.

        -  There is no requirement for prior systemic therapies, given the lack of known effective
           systemic treatments for metastatic OM.

      Design:

        -  Patients will undergo biopsy or resection to obtain tumor for generation of autologous
           TIL cultures and autologous cancer cell lines.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen

      of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  On day 0 patients will receive between 1x10(9) to 2x10(11) young TIL and then begin
           high dose aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses) or no
           aldesleukin if they are not medically eligible to receive it.

        -  A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 4-6 weeks after the last
           dose of aldesleukin in the aldesleukin arm and 4-6 weeks after the cell administration
           in the no aldesleukin arm.

        -  Patients will be enrolled into two cohorts. The cohort receiving high-dose aldesleukin
           (cohort A) will be conducted using a small optimal two-stage Phase II design, initially
           19 patients will be enrolled, and if 4 or more of the first 19 patients have a clinical
           response (PR or CR), accrual will continue to 33 patients, targeting a 35% goal for
           objective response. For the cohort that will not receive aldesleukin (cohort B), the
           study will be conducted as a Minimax two-stage phase II trial. Initially 12 evaluable
           patients will be enrolled to this cohort, and if 1 or more the first 12 have a
           response, then accrual would continue until a total of 21 patients, targeting a 20%
           goal for objective response.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Measurable metastatic ocular melanoma.

               3. Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter
                  and asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic
                  radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the
                  patient to be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are
                  eligible.

               4. Greater than or equal to 16 years of age and less than or equal to age 75.

               5. Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document

               6. Willing to sign a durable power of attorney

               7. Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1

               8. Life expectancy of greater than three months

               9. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time
                  of enrollment on this study and for up to four months after receiving the

              10. Serology:

                    -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated
                       in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                       seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less
                       responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its
                       toxicities.)

                    -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C
                       antibody. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be
                       tested for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

              11. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of
                  the potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

                  have recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or
                  vitiligo).

        Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks, as
        long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less or as specified in the
        eligibility criteria.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          2. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a
