    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia has proven to be an effective method for severe pain relief associated
      with labor and delivery. During labor, a low dose continuous infusion of local anesthetic
      and narcotic will be administered through an epidural catheter. As labor progresses and the
      baby's head makes it way through the pelvis, breakthrough pain may emerge and often needs
      further treatment. The investigators provide pain relief by administering analgesics through
      the epidural catheter. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of two
      medication mixtures believed to be successful in treating this type of pain associated with
      advanced labor. After this initial treatment, if pain relief is not attained, the patient
      may receive the other medication as well. The medications used in this study have been used
      at this institution for some time and have been found to be safe for mother and baby. The
      opioid (fentanyl) dose is small and only a small fraction will be transmitted to the baby.
      The other medication (clonidine) better known as a blood pressure medication has also been
      used for pain relief. Studies and clinical experience have shown that clonidine when given
      epidurally in the doses used in this study has minimal, if any effect, on the blood pressure
      of the mother or of the baby. The investigators will record medical and obstetric history
      and labor progress relevant to the patient. The patient will be asked questions regarding
      labor pain and side effects before and after the analgesic is administered. The primary
      objective is to determine which treatment regimen is more successful in abolishing
      breakthrough pain in advanced labor.

    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is a popular choice among patients for relief of severe pain associated
      with labor and delivery. Currently, at the investigators' institution the investigators use
      a continuous infusion of low dose local anesthetic and narcotic (12 ml/hr of 0.0625%
      bupivacaine with 2 micrograms/ml fentanyl) after the initial spinal or epidural dose to
      maintain patient comfort until delivery. This dose of the infusion is chosen because it
      often provides adequate comfort without interfering with the mobility of the patient and her
      ability to effectively push during delivery. However, this low-dose epidural infusion
      strategy often results in recurrence of pain after an initial pain-free period. This
      recurring pain is known as breakthrough pain and is alleviated by administering small
      boluses of analgesics via the epidural catheter.

      The pain occurring in labor is initially of visceral origin and is mediated by pain fibers
      originating from the low thoracic and upper lumbar segments of the spinal cord. As labor
      progresses to the late first phase (also known as transitional stage), pain sensations
      originating from the distension of the pelvic floor, vagina and perineum adds a somatic
      component to labor pain. This type of breakthrough pain, mediated by nerve fibers
      originating from the sacral nerves at dermatomes S2-S4, is often difficult to treat.
      Patients may experience inadequate analgesia even after boluses of analgesics are
      administered. Inadequate analgesia is deleterious due to subjective discomfort with its
      associated neurohumoral and physiological changes, and can be an initiator of the urge to
      bear down (push). Pushing before complete dilation of the cervix may lead to swelling,
      cervical injury and premature exhaustion of the mother. Adequate pain control will allow the
      cervix to fully dilate and motivate the mother to push effectively at the appropriate time.
      Although requests from patients to alleviate late stage breakthrough pain are common, there
      are no established data in the literature regarding the most effective strategy for pain
      management in this stage of labor.

      This study is designed to compare the efficacy of two treatments for controlling late first
      stage breakthrough pain during labor: clonidine-bupivacaine versus fentanyl-bupivacaine.
      Both strategies are used at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) in this clinical
      situation, and there is no clear evidence whether one is superior.
