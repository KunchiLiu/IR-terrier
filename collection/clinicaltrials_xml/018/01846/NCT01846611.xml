  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of trabectedin+DOXIL as a
      third-line chemotherapy regimen (treatment) in patients with platinum-sensitive
      advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who
      received 2 previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (individuals assigned to study treatment by chance), open - label
      (identity of assigned study drug will be known), active - controlled study in adult female
      patients with platinum-sensitive advanced - relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal,
      or fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum - based chemotherapy.
      Approximately 670 participants will be enrolled. Patients will be stratified by 4 criteria
      defined in the protocol and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the trabectedin+DOXIL
      combination therapy group (Arm A) or to the DOXIL (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin)
      monotherapy group (Arm B). During the treatment phase, patients will receive study drug
      infusions according to 21 - day cycles in Arm A and 28 - day cycles in Arm B. Treatment will
      continue until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable treatment toxicity, or
      until 2 cycles after assessment of a complete response (CR). Efficacy assessments will be
      evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Disease assessments, including
      assessments for patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease
      progression, will be performed until disease progression, the start of subsequent anticancer
      therapy, withdrawal of consent, or the clinical cutoff date. Collection of survival status
      will continue until at least 514 deaths have been observed. Serial pharmacokinetic (PK)
      samples will be collected in a subset of patients who voluntarily consent to the PK portion
      of the study. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. An interim analysis of overall
      survival (OS) will be performed after approximately 308 participants have died. The final
      analysis of OS will occur when approximately 514 deaths have been observed.
