      The purpose of this study is to examine whether the use of genetic test information and/or
      health coaching in patient risk counseling for heart disease and diabetes affect health
      behaviors and health outcomes in active-duty Air Force (ADAF), beneficiaries or dependents
      and Air Force retiree patients.

      Total of 400 subjects will be enrolled. They will be randomly(like flipping a coin)assigned
      to 4 groups: 1)Standard risk assessment (SRA)only; 2)SRA plus genetic risk information
      (SRA+G); 3)SRA plus health coaching (SRA+HC); or 4)SRA, genetic risk information, and health
      coaching (SRA+G+HC). Subjects randomized to the two genetic arms will have blood collected
      for testing of investigational coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk
      markers. Participants in the two groups that include health coaching will be assigned to a
      trained certified health coach for a period of 6 months. The duration of the study is 12
      months with 3 in person visits (baseline, 6 months and 12 months) and completion of surveys
      at 6 weeks and 3 month time points.

      This study will examine the impact of providing genetic CHD and T2D risk information, with
      or without a supportive behavioral intervention, on promoting risk-reducing behaviors and
      improving clinical outcomes. In short, using a 4-group (2X2) randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) design, this study will determine whether incorporating multiple-marker genetic
      testing into risk counseling for CHD and T2D, coupled with a health coaching intervention
      will lead to greater changes in physical fitness, health behaviors, risk status and clinical
      outcomes in active-duty Air Force (ADAF), beneficiaries or dependents and AF retiree
      patients (N=400).

      The study will address the following task objectives:

        1. Determine the main and interactive effects of multiple-marker genetic risk information
           incorporated into standard CHD and T2D risk counseling (Standard Risk Assessment, or
           SRA) and an established, structured telephonic health coaching intervention on health
           behavior change (diet, exercise habits, smoking cessation) over 12 months, with a focus
           on ADAF patients, as well as their beneficiaries and retirees.

        2. Determine the main and interactive effects of genetic risk information incorporated
           into standard CHD and T2D risk counseling and a telephonic health coaching intervention
           on clinical outcomes (fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, BMI, LDL, triglycerides,
           total cholesterol, AF composite fitness scores) over 12 months in this AF cohort.

           Given the lack of RCTs on the effects of differing genetic test results, such as false
           reassurance and genetic determinism, we will also pursue a third, exploratory task
           objective:

        3. Examine the differential effects of level of CHD and T2D genetic risk (# of risk
           alleles) on behavior change (diet, exercise habits, smoking cessation) and AF fitness
           scores at 12 months post baseline.

      Baseline data collection: After screening and informed consent, height and weight, SBP,
      waist circumference, current lab results (FPG, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HbA1c,
      and HDL) and current PHA (physical health assessment) data with fitness scores ( for active
      duty personnel only) will be obtained from the medical records. Subjects randomized to the
      two genetic arms will have blood collected for testing of investigational CHD and T2D risk
      markers.

      Randomization will take place to one of the following: SRA only; SRA plus genetic risk
      information (SRA+G); SRA plus health coaching (SRA+HC); or SRA, genetic risk information,
      and health coaching (SRA+G+HC).

      Risk Counseling Visit: Within four weeks after the baseline visit all participants will
      receive risk counseling with trained provider(s) at each clinic site.

      Health coaching intervention: Participants in the two groups that include health coaching
      will be assigned to a trained health coach for a period of 6 months (n=200). IHC
      (Integrative Health Coaching) sessions will be provided by telephone using a structure that
      has evolved in multiple trials and clinical programs at Duke Integrative Medicine.

      Six week, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups: At 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after the baseline
      visit, participants will be asked to complete selected surveys online.

      6month and 12 month study visits: 12 months from the baseline visit, active duty
      participants will complete their annual PHA, required annual AF fitness testing; and all
      participants will complete study visits at 6 and 12 months for weight, waist circumference,
      BP, fasting glucose or HbA1c and lipid panels to be re-assessed. Surveys will be completed
      at or prior to the final 12 month visit as well.
