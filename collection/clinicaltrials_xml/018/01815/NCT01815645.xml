  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crack addiction has became a severe health problem in Brazil. Today, crack addiction is the
      primary cause for inpatient treatment (voluntary or not) for all illicit substances (losing
      only for alcohol addiction). A survey study conducted with children and adolescents
      currently living in the streets of 5 major cities of Brazil, point alarming results in which
      15% to 26% of all these children have smoked crack at least once in the last month.

      When compared to cocaine, crack users develop much faster diagnoses for crack dependence
      (mean of 5 month after first use), shows a more compulsive pattern of use, has higher
      probability of living or have lived in the streets, and of engaging in illegal activities.
      Consequently to this, mortality of crack addicts are 7 times higher than for the rest of the
      population.

      Despite all efforts being made for the development of effective pharmacological treatments
      for stimulant addiction (crack included), up to today, there is no robust evidence of
      efficacy of any pharmacological treatment. For that reason, the use of evidence based
      psychosocial interventions is so important for treating this population.

      Although today open treatment facilities in Brazil are more and more starting to use
      evidence based interventions such as motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior therapy,
      relapse prevention and coping skills, such treatments present very modest results when
      treating crack addiction. The biggest difficulties encountered when treating this population
      are maintaining patients in treatment, reducing crack use and achieving continued
      abstinence.

      A psychosocial treatment based in behavioral principals' named Contingency Management (CM)
      is widely applied in the USA. Recent meta-analyses and review studies present robust
      evidence that, when applied alone or in adjunction with other psychosocial and
      pharmacological treatment, CM is the most effective treatment for what regards, treatment
      retention, reducing drug use and promoting continued abstinence.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if Contingence Management (CM) treatment can be
      affective on the treatment of crack addiction for Brazilian population seeking outpatient
      treatment.

      To accomplish this, 60 individuals (male and female from 18 to 65 years of age) seeking open
      treatment for crack addiction will be randomized to 2 treatment conditions (Standard
      treatment (ST) or ST plus CM). Both treatments will last 12 weeks with 3 and 6-month
      follow-up. In both groups patients will be encourage to leave urine samples 3 times week.

      Hypotheses: Patients receiving ST+CM will stay longer in treatment, have more negative tests
      for cocaine/crack, and achieve longer periods of cocaine/crack abstinence when compared to
      patients receiving ST alone.
