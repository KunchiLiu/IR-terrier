    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to identify lifestyle factors associated with PCOS and
      understand how diet and activity levels impact features of PCOS. The secondary aim is to
      examine psychosocial factors (e.g., health beliefs) of women with PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects 6-12% of
      reproductive-aged women within the general population. Currently, there is limited knowledge
      on the current lifestyles of women with PCOS and the psychosocial factors associated with
      PCOS.

      The researchers plan to examine potential lifestyle differences and psychosocial factors
      between PCOS and healthy women. The Research Team is also interested in the relationships
      between biological markers and lifestyle endpoints in women with and without PCOS. Previous
      literature has shown there are biological marker differences between those with and without
      PCOS. By examining these relationships, researchers may further understand whether PCOS
      status is associated with lifestyle parameters.

      To accomplish these objectives, 80 women (40 women with PCOS, 40 women without PCOS) will be
      included in this study. Women will be included in the PCOS group if they have a confirmed
      PCOS diagnosis from their primary care provider. Participants will complete a food frequency
      questionnaire and physical activity questionnaire. A researcher may also provide
      participants with an accelerometer to wear for a week. Ultrasound scans of the ovaries will
      be assessed and the following metabolic parameters will be assessed: (1) 75-gram oral
      glucose tolerance test; (2) dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan; (3) vitals and
      anthropometry assessment to measure waist and hip circumference, height, weight, blood
      pressure, and heart rate, and (4) fasting blood tests to detect androgens (i.e., total
      testosterone, androstenedione, free androgen index). Women with and without PCOS will also
      be asked to complete a questionnaire that will assess the psychosocial factors (e.g., health
      beliefs). This can be conducted online, in person, or through phone.
