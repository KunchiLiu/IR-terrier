      The focus of this proposal is to define the mechanism by which bariatric surgery acutely
      improves glucose homeostasis. Our central hypothesis is that drastically reduced caloric
      intake early after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) improves the pro-inflammatory profile of
      macrophages, which in turn improves insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.

    <textblock>
      One of the effects of bariatric surgery on Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Type 2 diabetes is
      the improvement in fasting glucose and insulin levels following the Roux en Y gastric bypass
      (RYGB) independent of weight loss. Changes in glucose metabolism are seen within days after
      surgery, prior to any significant weight loss--raising the question of a difference between
      dietary restriction and early food intake after the RYGB as it relates to insulin
      resistance. A major factor in the development of insulin resistance is obesity. It has been
      noted that by 3 months following Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery in obese patients with
      (T2DM), fasting glucose and insulin levels are improved independent of weight loss, insulin
      resistance in muscle is lowered, and that the pro-inflammatory profile of resident
      microphages is lowered improving insulin sensitivity.

      The focus of this proposal is to define the mechanism by which bariatric surgery improves
      glucose homeostasis in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Our long-term goal is to
      correlate these changes with direct measures of adipose tissue insulin resistance to develop
      novel immunotherapies towards reducing insulin resistance without surgery.

      Our central hypothesis is that drastically reduced caloric intake early after RYGP improves
      the pro-inflammatory profile of macrophages improving insulin sensitivity and glucose
      homeostasis. To test this hypothesis we propose the following aims:

      Specific Aim 1. Recruit a patient population and measure insulin sensitivity using
      homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) to measure insulin resistance (IR), cytokines,
      incretins, and serum adipokines in morbidly obese patients • prior to and 7-10 days
      following RYGB surgery while on a hypocaloric diet (surgery group) and •prior to and 7-10
      days while following hypocaloric diet similar to RYGB (diet group). Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to the two arms; subjects assigned to the hypocaloric diet will be offered
      RYGB after completion of the diet.

      Specific Aim 2.

        -  Profile inflammatory macrophages, T cells and secreted factors (incretins ?) in
           subcutaneous adipose tissue of patients prior to and following RYGB and hypocaloric
           diet treatments. • prior to and 7-10 days following RYGB (surgery group?)

        -  prior to and 7-10 days following hypocaloric diet similar to RYGB group (diet group?)

      Specific Aim 3.

      Assess the effects of RYGB on ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, expression of
      transcription factors and enzymes of mitochondrial biogenesis, and biomarkers of oxidative
      stress and protein carbonylation in patients prior to and following RYGB surgery and in diet
      subjects maintained on hypocaloric diet.

      Specific Aim 4.

      Determine the impact of bariatric surgery on lipolysis and the role of TLQP-21 (a
      genetically derived peptide that increases energy expenditure and prevents the early phase
      of diet-induced obesity).

      Rationale: Lipolysis is a central feature of adipocyte biology. It is currently unclear if
      bariatric surgery can modulate basal and stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes. Additionally,
      Bartlomucci had demonstrated that the murine (mouse) version of TLQP-21 enhances lipolysis
      in adipocytes. Batolomucci has shown that the human version of TLQP-21 shows a lower
      biological activity on its human receptor compared to the mouse version.
