  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the impact of a newly developed educational program on
      kidney transplant candidates' communication about living and deceased donor kidney
      transplantation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Communicating about Choices (COACH) in Transplantation program educates patients with
      end stage renal disease, who are waitlisted for kidney transplantation, about kidney disease
      and the risks, benefits and processes for both living and deceased donor transplantation.
      The program also teaches key communication skills needed to effectively initiate and manage
      conversations about transplantation.
