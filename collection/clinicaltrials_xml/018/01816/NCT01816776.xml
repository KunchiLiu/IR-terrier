    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this prospective, multicenter, randomized trial is to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of therapy delivered by the remedē® system in subjects with
      moderate to severe central sleep apnea and optimal medical management, compared to outcomes
      in randomized control subjects receiving optimal medical management and implanted but
      inactive remedē® systems.

    <description>The primary effectiveness objective of the trial is to demonstrate that the Treatment group achieves an AHI reduction from baseline to 6 months post therapy initiation that is greater than the Control group. The primary effectiveness endpoint will be evaluated by comparing the proportions of subjects in the two study groups that meet the following success criterion: Subject success on the primary AHI endpoint is defined as a subject achieving a 50% or greater reduction in AHI from baseline to 6 months post-therapy initiation visit.</description>
