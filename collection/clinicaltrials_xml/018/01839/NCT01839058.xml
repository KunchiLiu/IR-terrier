    <textblock>
      Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is a common disorder whose pathophysiology is poorly
      understood. Some evidence suggests it may be related to sustained esophageal contractions
      (SECs) of longitudinal smooth muscle. The investigators have previously shown that acid is a
      trigger for SECs and results in shortening of the esophagus. In this study, the
      investigators plan to prospectively evaluate esophageal shortening responses to acid in a
      group of patients with NCCP compared to controls. The investigators will use high resolution
      esophageal manometry coupled with acid infusion to evaluate shortening. The investigators
      hypothesize that at least a subset of patients with NCCP will have an exaggerated esophageal
      shortening response to acid which correlates with symptom production. If our hypothesis
      proves true, this may lead to a future therapeutic target in the treatment of these
      patients.

    <description>Esophageal shortening will be defined as the point during the 20 minute acid infusion at which the lower esophageal sphincter begins to migrate proximally. A 2 minute window following this time point will then be used to determine if patients symptoms increased by &gt; 2 on a visual analogue pain scale between 0 - 10.</description>

    <description>Both cohorts will undergo standard high resolution esophageal manometry testing. This entails a catheter passed through the nose into the esophagus and measures pressure changes with a series of wet swallows. As part of the study, we will also be instilling both weak acid and saline into the esophagus.</description>
