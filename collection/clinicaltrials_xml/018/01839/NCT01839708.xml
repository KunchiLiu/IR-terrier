      Mothers in Motion will draw on the successes of the pilot intervention of the same name and
      will promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes (eating more fruits and vegetables,
      increasing physical activity, dealing with stress) in low-income WIC mothers of young
      children. The intervention group's weight change (difference between the initial enrollment
      and 3 months post intervention) will differ from the control group's weight change by an
      average of at least 2.8 pounds.

      Mothers in Motion will draw on the successes of the pilot intervention of the same name and
      will promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes (eating more fruits and vegetables,
      increasing physical activity, dealing with stress) in low-income WIC mothers of young
      children. Both treatment groups will receive usual WIC care (nutrition counseling and
      similar services). The control group will receive generic printed health and nutrition
      materials to read at their own pace if they wish. The intervention group will watch the
      culturally sensitive DVD chapters according to a study calendar, complete action plan
      worksheets, and call in to peer support group teleconferences to discuss the DVD chapter
      contents. The teleconferences will be led by moderators trained in motivational interviewing
      (MI) and group factilitation. Participants will complete phone interviews and provide body
      weight measurements at baseline (T1), immediately after (T2) and 3 months after (T3) the
      intervention time period. T3 body weight will be the primary outcome.
