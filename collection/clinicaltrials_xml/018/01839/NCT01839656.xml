  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to examine the clinical efficacy of multiple doses of nusinersen
      (ISIS 396443) administered intrathecally to participants with Infantile-Onset Spinal
      Muscular Atrophy (SMA). The secondary objectives are to examine the safety and tolerability
      of multiple doses of nusinersen administered intrathecally to participants with
      infantile-onset SMA and to examine the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and plasma
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple doses of nusinersen administered intrathecally to
      participants with infantile-onset SMA.

          -  History of brain or spinal cord disease that would interfere with the lumbar puncture
             (LP) procedures, CSF circulation, or safety assessments

          -  Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or an
             implanted central nervous system (CNS) catheter

          -  History of bacterial meningitis

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters,

             creatine, sodium phenylbutyrate, salbutamol, valproate, hydroxyurea etc), biological
             agent, or device within 90 days prior to enrollment or anytime during the study. Any
             history of gene therapy or cell transplantation

          -  The participants parent(s) or legal guardian(s) is unable to understand the nature,
             scope, and possible consequences of the study, or does not agree to comply with the

          -  Ongoing medical condition that according to the Site Investigator would interfere
             with the conduct and assessments of the study. Examples are medical disability other
             than SMA that would interfere with the assessment of safety or would compromise the
             ability of the participant to undergo study procedures
