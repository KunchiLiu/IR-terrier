  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects being evaluated for suspected or known Coronary artery Disease (CAD) based on signs
      and/or symptoms, will be invited to participate in the study. The duration for a subject in
      the study may range from 2 days to 4-6 weeks. One to four visits to the study doctor will be
      required.

      This study will investigate the diagnostic results of gadobutrol-enhanced Cardiac Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (CMRI) images regarding the detection (sensitivity) and exclusion
      (specificity ) of coronary artery disease utilizing a uniform image acquisition software.
      The CMR images will be tested either against the results from routine clinical Coronary
      Angiography (CA) or those from Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), which is used as the
      standard of reference. The CA/CTA may have been performed up to 4 weeks prior to enrollment
      or be scheduled up to 4/6 weeks after the study.

      CMRI and CA/CTA images will be collected for an independent image review (blinded read).
