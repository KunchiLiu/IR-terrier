      This phase II trial studies how well treosulfan, fludarabine phosphate, and total body
      irradiation before donor stem cell transplant works in treating patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Giving chemotherapy, such as treosulfan
      and fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant
      helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from
      rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune
      cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal
      cells. Giving tacrolimus before and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this
      from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the better of two treosulfan-based conditioning regimens in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), by comparing 6-month
      progression-free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effects of two conditioning regimens on changes in gene expression
      profiles, and evaluate the association of gene expression profiles and disease relapse.

      II. Determine the incidence of progression-free survival at 1 year and 2 years after
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      III. Evaluate overall survival (OS) at 6 months, at 1 year and at 2 years after HCT.

      IV. Determine the incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      V. Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD.

      VI. Determine donor chimerism around days +28 and +84.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive treosulfan intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -6
      to -4 and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2. Patients undergo
      low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant or bone
      marrow transplant on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients with a related donor receive tacrolimus orally (PO) every 8 or 12
      hours on days -3 to 56 with taper to day 180. Beginning 4-6 hours after PBSC infusion,
      patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO every 12 hours to day 28. Patients with an
      unrelated donor receive tacrolimus PO every 8 or 12 hours on days -3 to 100 with taper to
      day 180. Beginning 4-6 hours after PBSC infusion, patients also receive mycophenolate
      mofetil PO every 8 hours to day 40 with taper to day 96.

      NOTE: Patients with related donors eligible for FHCRC protocol 2545 may receive cyclosporine
      IV, instead of tacrolimus, beginning on day -3 to day 50 with a taper to day 180.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>Among genes identified whose expression is modified by conditioning, degree of change in expression will be evaluated to determine if it is correlated with relapse risk and offers improved prediction of relapse risk over that obtained with standard clinical parameters (cytogenetics, blast count, International Prognostic Scoring System score, minimal residual disease. To account for censoring and the competing risk of non-relapse mortality (NRM), the analysis will be a time-to-event analysis of relapse using Cox regression, with change in expression as a continuous covariate (on a log scale). 8</description>
