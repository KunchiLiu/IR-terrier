    <textblock>
      This is an open label, long term extension to Study AMB115811. All subjects may remain in
      the extension study for a minimum of 18 months. Beyond the 18-month period, subjects may
      continue in the extension study until one of the following:

        -  The product is approved locally for use in inoperable CTEPH patients;

        -  Development for use in the CTEPH population is discontinued or product is not approved
           by the local regulatory authorities

        -  The investigator decides to discontinue the subject or subject decides to discontinue
           from the study.

      The primary purpose of this study is to provide clinically relevant information on the long
      term safety of ambrisentan in subjects with inoperable CTEPH.
