  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the differences in functional and patient reported
      outcomes between total knee replacement (TKA) implants. In addition, this work will examine
      the correlation between functional assessments and patient reported outcomes following
      surgery. All subjects will complete assessments preoperatively, 4-6 weeks following TKA and
      then one year following TKA. Subjects will complete a series of patient reported outcomes as
      well as a series of functional outcomes at each of the time points of interest. The analysis
      will include a repeated measures design to determine differences between groups across time
      as well as correlations between the functional and patient reported outcomes. This work will
      hopefully determine the importance of using objective functional outcomes following TKA as
      well as determining the need for patient assessments out to one year following surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test (YBT-LQ) (Dynamic Balance)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 and 52 weeks post total knee replacement</time_frame>
    <description>The lower quarter y-balance test (YBT-LQ) is a test of dynamic balance in unilateral stance that has been deemed to be reliable and valid. The YBT-LQ consists of each patient standing on one leg and reaching as far as they can with their non-stance leg in the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral direction while standing on the other foot on a centralized stance platform.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Walking Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 and 52 weeks after total knee replacement</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will complete three walking trials at a self-selected comfortable walking speed along a 5 meter walkway in order to record walking speed at each time point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 and 52 weeks after total knee replacement</time_frame>
    <description>The UCLA activity score is a validated patient reported outcome of overall physical activity</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 and 52 weeks following total knee replacement</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS is a standardized and validated patient outcome score that assesses functional limitation in patient with knee problems.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Forgotten Joint Score (FJS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 and 52 weeks following total knee replacement</time_frame>
    <description>The FJS is a patient reported measure of how bothersome the total joint replacement is for them, how much it affects daily activity and how much they are aware of the implant.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 and 52 weeks following total knee replacement</time_frame>
    <description>The KSS is a patient reported measure of knee function that is specific to patients who are scheduled to receive or have previously had a total knee replacement. This outcome measures both patient reported pain and function changes from prior to surgery through recovery.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sit to Stand Time</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 and 52 weeks following total knee replacement</time_frame>
    <description>The sit to stand test requires patients to stand up and sit down as many times as possible in 10 seconds from a standard arm chair.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Timed get up and go</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 and 52 weeks following total knee replacement</time_frame>
    <description>The timed up and go requires a patient to rise from a chair walk three meters around a piece of tape and return to the chair again as quickly as possible.</description>
