    <textblock>
      The seizure detection and warning system is an ambulatory system designed to monitor and
      analyze EMG data to detect the onset of GTC seizures and to provide a warning signal to
      alert caregivers that a seizure is occurring.

    <measure>Primary outcome is accuracy of device to detect GTC seizures when compared to video EEG.</measure>
    <time_frame>less than 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the research is to determine the ability of the Brain Sentinel Seizure Detection System to accurately detect GTC seizures in comparison to the recognized &quot;gold standard&quot; for seizure detection, video Electroencephalography (vEEG).The primary endpoint will be the sensitivity of GTC seizure detection (defined as within 30 seconds of motor manifestation via vEEG analysis) in a hospital setting.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of study device to self reporting of seizures using a seizure diary.</measure>
    <time_frame>Less than 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective is to assess the operation of the Brain Sentinel Seizure Detection System when used in the subject's home and to compare the GTC seizure reporting of the device to a standard seizure diary completed by the subject/caregiver.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, either primary GTC or partial
             onset seizures with 2nd generalization.

          -  Be admitted to a hospital for routine vEEG monitoring related to seizures.

          -  Be ages 2-99.

          -  Have an upper arm circumference which is adequate for proper fit of the EMG monitor
             or the monitor with arm adapter (approximately 16 cm).

          -  Be able to be discharged to a home with electrical power supply.

          -  Be able to be discharged to a home where internet service via phone, broadband,
             satellite or cellular phone service can be provided.

          -  If female and of childbearing potential, have negative pregnancy test.

          -  Can understand and sign written informed consent, or will have a parent or a legally
             authorized representative (LAR) who can do so, prior to the performance of any study
             assessments.

          -  Subject and/or Primary Caregiver must be competent to follow all study procedures.

          -  Able to read, speak, and understand English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Does not have a documented history of generalized seizures.

          -  Has not had a GTC seizure within the last year AND is not expected to have a
             reduction of anti-epileptic drugs during their hospital admission.

          -  Intracranial EEG electrodes are being used

          -  Upper arm circumference not adequate for proper fit of the EMG monitor even if the
             arm adapter is used (less than approximately 16cm).

          -  If female, is pregnant.

          -  Subject or Caregiver are unable to provide consent.

          -  Subject or Caregiver not competent to follow home study procedures.

          -  Homeless or home without power supply.

          -  Resides in a home where internet service via phone, broadband, satellite or cellular
             phone service cannot be provided.

          -  Subject or Caregiver is unable to read, speak, or understand English.
