  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of SPG
      stimulation with the ISS in a 24 hour window, in patients with an acute ischemic stroke in
      the anterior circulation, who received IV-rtPA and Standard of Care.

      This will be a multi-center, multinational, randomized, double blind, sham control,
      adjunctive to Standard of Care, parallel arm study and will include ongoing DSMB review of
      accumulated safety data.

      The study has three phases:

      Phase I - Implantation Safety Assessment Number of patients: 20 (at least 10 implantations)

        -  Implanters: only certified implanters who already performed implantation of ISS in
           previous studies

        -  Continue to the next phase if there are no serious procedure complications related to
           rtPA (as determined by the implanter). Otherwise, implement retirements and continue
           only after DSMB approval.

      DSMB meetings: after 10 implantations

      Phase II - Symptomatic Hemorrhage Assessment (sICH):

        -  Number of patients: 50 (additional 30)

        -  Implanters: all certified implanters

        -  Continue to the next phase if there is no clinically meaningful difference between
           treated and control. A clinically meaningful difference is a difference of more than 3
           sICH cases within the first 5 days of treatment, in the treated arm compared to the
           control arm. Otherwise, implement retirements and continue only after DSMB approval.

        -  DSMB meetings: after 30 and 50 patients

      Phase III - Entire study population, DSMB meetings once per quarter
