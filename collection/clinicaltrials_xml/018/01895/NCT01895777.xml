    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, multi-centre non-inferiority
      study of dabigatran etexilate versus standard of care in children from birth to less than 18
      years of age will assess the efficacy and safety of dabigatran relative to low molecular
      weight heparins or vitamin K antagonists for treatment of VTE. This study will also assess
      the appropriateness of the proposed dabigatran doses for use in paediatric patients using
      three different formulations of dabigatran (capsules, pellets and oral liquid formulation)

          -  Clinical indication for at least 3 month of treatment with anticoagulants for the VTE
             episode defined under the above inclusion criterion.

          -  Written informed consent provided by the patient's parent or legal guardian and
             assent provided by the patient (if applicable) at the time of informed consent form
             (ICF) signature according to local regulations.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Conditions associated with an increased risk of bleeding

          -  Renal dysfunction (eGFR &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73m2 using the Schwartz formula) or requirement
             for dialysis

          -  Subjects with a mechanical or a biological heart valve prosthesis

        aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase (AP) &gt; 3 ×
        upper limit of normal (ULN) within 3 months of screening

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females. Females who have reached menarche and are not
             using a medically accepted contraceptive method per local guidelines. Acceptable
             methods of birth control must be used in a correct and consistent manner

          -  Patients in stratum 3 (0 to &lt; 2 years) with gestational age at birth &lt; 37 weeks or

          -  Anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 80g/L) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 80 x 109/L) at
             screening. Transfusions during the screening period are allowed, provided that a
             satisfactory hemoglobin or platelet level is attained prior to visit 2

          -  Patients who have taken prohibited or restricted medication within one week of the
             first dose of study medication other than medication for prior VTE treatment and
             P-glycoprotein inhibitors..

          -  Patients who have received an investigational drug in the past 30 days prior to
             screening

          -  Patients who are allergic/sensitive to any component of the study medication

          -  Patients or parents/legal guardians who are unwilling or unable to undergo or permit
             repeat of the baseline imaging tests required to confirm thrombus resolution at study
             day 84 (or eEOT, whichever comes first) or in whom repeating such imaging tests at
             these pre-specified time points may not be medically in the patient's best interest.
             Examples may include unwarranted radiation exposure as a result of a repeat CT scan
             at day 84 for a patient with an isolated case of pulmonary embolism evaluated at
             baseline solely by a CT scan. In such cases, the baseline radiological assessment
             (e.g. CT) may be supplemented with an acceptable non-radiological assessment at
             baseline (e.g. MRI) which could then be repeated at day 84 hence alleviating any
             potential unwarranted radiation exposure.
