      The goal of this protocol is to establish a cohort of at least 1500 biologic samples
      collected prospectively from patients treated in BMT CTN centers that will be a shared bio
      specimen resource for conducting future allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HCT) correlative studies.

      The goal of this protocol is to establish a cohort of biologic samples collected
      prospectively from patients treated in BMT CTN centers that will be a shared bio specimen
      resource for conducting future allogeneic HCT correlative studies. This resource is designed
      to allow genomic, proteomic and transcriptional data to be integrated with high quality
      clinical phenotype and outcomes data to identify risk factors for development and severity
      of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, organ toxicity, relapse, mortality, infection and other
      clinically significant complications occurring after allogeneic HCT.

      To achieve this goal, patients and donors will be recruited and consent obtained at the time
      that they enroll on BMT CTN protocols where enrollment occurs at or before transplantation
      or prior to start of conditioning for patients enrolled on non-BMT CTN studies or treated as
      standard of care. Samples will be collected: (1) from patients and donors pre-transplant;
      and, (2) from patients post-transplant on a calendar schedule through the first 3 months
      post-HCT. For patients co-enrolled on BMT CTN studies, clinical data will be collected in
      the context of the primary transplant protocols. For patients not enrolled on BMT CTN
      protocols, clinical data on early post-transplant events will be collected using the same
      data collection forms and systems that are used on BMT CTN trials. Additional clinical data
      for both BMT CTN and non-BMT CTN patients will be available from data submitted to the
      Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) using the CIBMTR
      Comprehensive Report Forms. This protocol also leverages ongoing pre-transplant
      donor-recipient sample collection performed by the CIBMTR and National Marrow Donor Program
      (NMDP). Success in establishing this shared resource will inspire future investigator
      initiated research proposals and will allow investigators to take advantage of National
      Institutes of Health (NIH) funding initiatives.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Recipients of first allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants that are transplanted
             in U.S. centers that participate in the NMDP/CIBMTR's &quot;Protocol for a Research Sample
             Repository for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Marrow Toxic
             Injuries&quot; and receive a cord blood graft or receive a bone marrow or peripheral blood
             graft from a related donor or from an unrelated donor in an NMDP-affiliated Donor
             Center or Registry participating in that same protocol.

             This transplant and donor center restriction is to allow linkage with pretransplant
             donor specimens collected under the NMDP/CIBMTR protocol. Current data indicate that
             &gt;90% of donors approached under this protocol agree to provide samples

          2. Patients with any malignant or non-malignant hematologic disorder will be eligible
             for enrollment on this protocol. A subset of 240 sequential patients with acute
             leukemia in first or second remission will also provide research samples for gene
             expression studies.

          3. Children may participate in this study but must weigh at least 20 kilograms given the
             volume (100ml) and number of blood draws during this study. Subjects must weigh at
             least 30 kg to provide research samples for gene expression studies (additional 40
             ml).

          4. All participants or parent/legal guardian must sign an informed consent for this
             study.

        Because studies using this resource will require linking with clinical data collected by
        CIBMTR, all participants or parent/legal guardian must also consent to participate in
        &quot;Protocol for a Research Database for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Marrow Toxic
        Injuries&quot;.
