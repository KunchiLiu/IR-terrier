  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot feasibility study is to assess whether treating meibomian gland
      dysfunction (MGD) prior to cataract surgery helps promote meibomian gland function, visual
      quality and ocular comfort after cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, prospective, non-significant risk, open-label, randomized
      multi-center clinical trial evaluating treatment with the LipiFlow System in patients with
      meibomian gland dysfunction prior to planned bilateral cataract surgery. All subjects
      undergo examination to determine study eligibility and to capture the Baseline status prior
      to surgery. Subjects are randomized to receive LipiFlow treatment (Pre-treatment group) one
      month before cataract surgery or no LipiFlow treatment (Untreated Control group). Cataract
      surgery is performed on both eyes of each subject with the second eye surgery completed
      within two months of the first eye. All subjects are evaluated at one month and three months
      after cataract surgery on the second eye with comparison of the study endpoints between the
      Pre-treatment and Untreated groups. To facilitate subject recruitment, the Untreated Control
      group receives crossover LipiFlow treatment for MGD (Post-treatment group) three months
      after cataract surgery on the second eye.

    <description>The primary endpoint assesses change in meibomian gland function by scoring the meibomian gland secretion characteristics before and after surgery. The primary endpoint is the mean change in total meibomian gland score in the Pre-treatment group compared to the Untreated group from Baseline after cataract surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month and 3 Months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint assesses the change in visual quality and ocular comfort before and after cataract surgery using the OSDI questionnaire. The secondary endpoint is the mean change in the OSDI questionnaire score in the Pre-treatment group compared to the Untreated group from Baseline after cataract surgery.</description>
