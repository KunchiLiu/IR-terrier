  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are investigating the impact of duloxetine (&quot;Cymbalta&quot;), a serotonin and norepinephrine
      reuptake inhibitor, on pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Specifically, the
      investigators will determine whether duloxetine, 60 mg daily for 2 weeks, reduces pain
      scores 2 weeks after TKA.
