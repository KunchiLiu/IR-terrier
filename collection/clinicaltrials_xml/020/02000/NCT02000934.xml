    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study of TAK-659 in adult
      patients with advanced solid tumor and lymphoma malignancies. This study will be the first
      to administer TAK-659 to humans. The patient population during dose escalation (Part A) will
      consist of adults previously diagnosed with any form of a solid tumor or lymphoma for which
      standard, curative, or life-prolonging treatment does not exist or is no longer effective.
      This first-in-human (FIH) study will include 5 dose expansion cohorts in refractory and/or
      relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), indolent
      Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), Post Transplant Lymphoproliferative
      Disorder (PTLD) (Part B) following completion of dose escalation (Part A).

        Inclusion Criteria

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the
        study:

          1. Male or female patients 18 years or older

          2. To be enrolled to the dose escalation (Part A), patients must have

               1. histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic and/or
                  advanced solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma, for which no effective standard
                  treatment is available. However, patients with primary brain tumors or WM will
                  be excluded.

               2. Radiographically or clinically measurable or nonmeasurable (but evaluable)
                  disease. Radiographically measurable disease is determined by RECIST(version
                  1.1) for solid tumors or by IWG criteria for malignant lymphoma (2007 IWG).

          3. To be enrolled to the dose expansion cohorts (Part B), patients must meet the
             following criteria:

               1. Histologically confirmed or diagnosis of CLL that meets IWCLL 2008 criteria for
                  Cohort 1; DLBCL for Cohort 2; B-cell NHL (FL [Grade 1, 2, or 3a], SLL, LPL/WM,
                  MZL [splenic, nodal, or extra-nodal]) for Cohort 3; MCL for Cohort 4; and PTLD
                  (early lesion, polymorphic, monomorphic, classical Hodgkin lymphoma-type,
                  EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly, DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation;
                  along with documented or documentable EBER status by tissue ISH) for Cohort 5

               2. Must have received ≥ 1 prior therapy (excluding radiation); either treatment
                  naïve to, relapsed/refractory to, or treatment failure due to other reasons with
                  ibrutinib, idelalisib, or any other investigational BCR in pathway inhibitors
                  not directly targeting SYK; considered not appropriate for treatment or
                  retreatment with purine analog-based therapy (CLL); or considered ineligible for
                  at least 1 prior therapy (PTLD)

               3. Radiographically or clinically measurable and/or evaluable disease as specified
                  in the protocol

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.

          5. Patients must have adequate organ function, including bone marrow reserve, hepatic,
             and renal function as described in the protocol

          6. Female patients who are postmenopausal for at least 1 year, are surgically sterile,
             or if of childbearing potential who agree to use 2 effective method(s) of
             contraception during the study treatment period through 6 months after the last dose
             of study drug or practice true abstinence.

             Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, who agree to practice effective barrier
             contraception during the study treatment period through 6 months after the last dose
             of study drug or practice true abstinence.

          7. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          8. Patients must have recovered from the reversible effects of prior anticancer therapy
             (to Grade ≤ 1).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the
        study.

          1. Patients with brain metastasis, or patients with active secondary malignancy that
             requires treatment, with exceptions as described in the protocol

          2. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness, including drug or alcohol abuse, that
             could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of
             treatment according to this protocol.

          3. Life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer; major surgery, systemic infection
             requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within 14
             days before the first dose of study drug.

          4. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          5. Any immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational therapy within 2-4
             weeks before the first dose of study treatment, as detailed in the protocol

          6. For escalation cohort or expansion cohorts excluding PTLD, autologous stem cell
             transplant within 6 months before Day 1 of Cycle 1, or prior allogeneic stem cell
             transplant at any time.

          7. Treatment with high dose corticosteroids (&gt; daily dose equivalent to 10 mg oral

          8. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive; known hepatitis B surface

             protocol.

         10. Known GI disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or
             tolerance of TAK-659 including difficulty swallowing tablets; diarrhea &gt; Grade 1
             despite supportive therapy.

         11. Lack of suitable venous access for required blood sampling
