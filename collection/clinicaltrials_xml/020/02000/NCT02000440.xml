    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase II, proof-of-mechanism study to evaluate
      the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of losmapimod in approximately 21
      subjects with primary (idiopathic) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and substantive
      proteinuria as indicated by a Urinary protein/creatinine Up/c ratio &gt;=2 gram/gram (g/g) or
      24 hr urine protein &gt;=2 g/day. Losmapimod will be orally administered twice daily over a
      24-week treatment phase followed by a 12-week follow-up for safety and relapse assessments.

             screening laboratory assessments (not related to the disease), which in the opinion
             of the Investigator could confound the results of the study or put the subject at
             undue risk.

          -  History of sensitivity or intolerance to the study treatment (i.e. losmapimod), or a
             history of drug or other allergy that in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK

             or manual overread); or QTc &gt;=480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. If a
             single QTc is abnormal, then the averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms
             (ECGs) obtained (each separated by at least 5 min) will be utilized to determine
             eligibility.

          -  Hypertensive as defined as blood pressure (BP) &gt;140/90 millimetres of mercury (mmHg)
             at the end of screening: If the single BP measurement is above 140 mmHg systolic or
             90 mmHg diastolic, then the BP measurement can be repeated. The subject must have 2
             consecutive BP readings that are less than 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic,
             and each measurement must be separated by at least 15 minutes, to be eligible for

             B surface antigen (HBsAg), and anti- hepatitis B core antigen (HBc), positive test
             for Hepatitis C antibody confirmed by HCV RNA. If HCV RNA is not available, then the
             positive test for Hepatitis C antibody alone would be exclusionary.

          -  Subject having donated blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day
             period prior to the first dose of the current study.

          -  Participation: The subject has participated in a clinical trial where they previously
             received losmapimod; the subject has participated in a clinical trial and has
             received an investigational product 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of
             the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer) prior to
             the first dose of the current study.
