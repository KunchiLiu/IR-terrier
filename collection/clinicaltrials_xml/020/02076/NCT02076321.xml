  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are excellent medications
      for providing pain control in children with fractures or those who have surgery to correct
      bony deformity requiring the bone to be cut (osteotomy) and realigned. There is some data to
      suggest that these types of medications can adversely affect bone healing in adult patients
      with broken bones or those having spine fusion surgery. There is little data with regard to
      how these medications effect bone healing in children. With this project, the investigators'
      goal is to determine if NSAIDs delay or otherwise adversely effect bone healing and to
      demonstrate that these medications adequately control pain in children with broken bones or
      those who have had an osteotomy.

    <textblock>
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in controlling both
      post-operative pain and pain associated with orthopaedic injuries, particularly in the
      pediatric population. Additionally, use of NSAIDs for pain control in this setting avoids
      the use of narcotic pain medications, the adverse effects of which are well known.

      Recent research has suggested a possible association between use of NSAIDs and impaired
      fracture healing in the skeletally mature, or adult, population. Several adult mammal
      studies have demonstrated inhibition of bony repair with administration of NSAIDs. Yet,
      other adult animal studies have failed to find the same effect. Clinical data in the adult
      population is similarly conflicted, with some studies showing an inhibition of bone healing
      after posterior spinal fusion, while a larger study found no correlation. The data
      investigating the effects of NSAID use in adults after fracture or osteotomy is even less
      clear with some studies demonstrating higher rates of non-union with NSAID administration
      and others finding no significant effect on bone healing.

      The research investigating these outcomes in the skeletally immature population is limited;
      one study compared administration of ketorolac versus normal saline for 7, 14 and 21 days in
      a juvenile rat model with a stabilized tibia fracture. They found no significant difference
      in strength, stiffness or histological characteristics of fracture callus between the two
      groups. Clinical retrospective studies of the pediatric population with regard to use of
      NSAIDs after posterior spinal fusion have failed to reproduce findings of inhibitory effects
      on bone healing. Similarly, two retrospective studies found no cases of delayed union or
      non-union in pediatric patients who received perioperative ketorolac around the time of
      operative fixation of fractures, or osteotomy. Given these results, the way in which and the
      degree to which NSAIDs perturb the inflammatory mileu during the acute phase of healing is
      potentially distinct from the effects on bone healing in the skeletally mature.

      There have been no clinical prospective, randomized studies to evaluate the effect, if any,
      that NSAIDs have on bone healing in the skeletally immature patient population. The
      investigators hypothesize that NSAID administration in the acute phase of bone healing,
      whether it be a fracture or osteotomy, will not result in delayed union or non-union as
      compared to patients who take acetaminophen for pain control during this same time period.
