    <textblock>
      This purpose of this clinical trial is to study the safety and efficacy of Topical Thrombin
      (Human) Grifols as an add-on treatment to help stop bleeding during vascular, liver, soft
      tissue, and spinal open surgical procedures. Approximately 180 subjects will be treated with
      either Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols (120 subjects) or Bovine Thrombin JMI® (60
      subjects). Subjects will be evaluated for identification of a target bleeding site (TBS) in
      which control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques is ineffective or impractical and
      requires an additional treatment to stop the bleeding. The Investigator (surgeon) will rate
      the intensity of bleeding at the TBS. Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols or Bovine Thrombin
      JMI will then be applied to the TBS and the amount of bleeding at the TBS will be examined.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled, Phase II study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols as an adjunct to hemostasis during
      vascular (IG1202-A), hepatic (IG1202-B), soft tissue (IG1202-C), and spinal (IG1202-D) open
      surgical procedures. Approximately 180 subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment
      groups in a 2:1 ratio: Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols (120 subjects) or Bovine Thrombin
      JMI (60 subjects) among the 4 types of surgeries. Randomized subjects will be evaluated for
      identification of a target bleeding site (TBS) in which control of bleeding by conventional
      surgical techniques (including suture, ligature and cautery) is ineffective or impractical
      and requires an adjunct treatment to achieve hemostasis. The Investigator will rate the
      intensity of bleeding at the TBS. Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols or Bovine Thrombin JMI
      will be applied to the TBS and hemostasis will be assessed at various timepoints during a
      5-minute observation period.
