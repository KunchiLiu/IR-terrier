        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects ≥18 years of age, requiring an elective or urgent, open aortic surgical
             procedure utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass. Subjects in Japan between ≥18 and &lt;20
             years of age will require consent by the subject's legal representative

          -  Subjects must be willing to participate in the study and provide written informed
             consent.

          -  Presence of an appropriate Target Bleeding Site (TBS) along the anastomotic suture
             line, involving a synthetic aortic graft, as identified intra-operatively by the
             investigator;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the
             study product or unwilling to receive blood products;

          -  Exposure to another investigational drug or device in a clinical trial within 30 days
             prior to surgery or anticipated in the 60 day follow up period after surgery.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  TBS is from a large defects in visible arteries or veins where the injured vascular
             wall requires repair and maintenance of vessel patency or where there would be
             persistent exposure of EVARREST™ Fibrin Sealant Patch to blood flow and/or pressure
             during absorption of the product;

          -  TBS with major arterial bleeding requiring suture or mechanical ligation;

          -  TBS involves an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft

          -  TBS within an actively infected field;

          -  Bleeding site is in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, or areas of bony
             confine;

          -  Subjects with any intra-operative findings identified by the investigator that may
             preclude conduct of the study procedure;
