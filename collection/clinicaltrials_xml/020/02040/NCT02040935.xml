    <textblock>
      This single-arm, open-label, local multicenter study will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of Herceptin (trastuzumab) administered subcutaneously by a single-use
      injection device (SID) in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Following surgery
      (and neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy), patients will receive Herceptin 600 mg
      subcutaneously by SID every 3 weeks for a total of 1 year, unless disease recurrence or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs. After the first 3 cycles, patients will be permitted to
      self-administer Herceptin under supervision of a HCP.

             treatment, including severe pulmonary conditions/illness

          -  Serious cardiac illness or medical conditions that would preclude the use of
             trastuzumab, specifically: history of documented congestive heart failure, high-risk

             treatment, including hormonal therapy, biphosphonate therapy and immunotherapy,
             within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment

          -  Known hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, to any excipients of
