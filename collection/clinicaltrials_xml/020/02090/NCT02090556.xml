  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the retention rate of Abatacept SC over 24 months
      in routine clinical practice, in rheumatoid arthritis patients, in each country involved in
      the study. The purpose of the UK substudy is to explore whether integrating self-assessment
      into routine care could maintain tight control (of inflammation/disease activity) and at
      potentially lower cost resulting in improved health outcomes and cost-effectiveness.
