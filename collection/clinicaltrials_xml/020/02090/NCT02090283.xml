      Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare group of inherited disorders that manifest as
      blistering or erosion of the skin and in some cases, the epithelial lining of other organs,
      in response to little or no apparent trama. There is a lack of effective agents for skin
      disorders involving blistering and lesion formation. Current approved therapies are
      minimally effective and have safety issues. Scioderm has developed SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%)
      for treatment of EB.

      This is an open label extension study to assess the continued safety of topically applied
      SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%) in subjects with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, and Junctional
      non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa.

      SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%) will be applied topically, once a day to the entire body for a
      period of 1080 days. Subjects who successfully complete the entire SD-003 study will have
      the option to roll over into the SD-004 study. The baseline visit 1 will occur at the final
      visit date for SD-003. The Body Surface Area (BSA) coverage of blisters and lesions
      assessment made at the final SD-003 study visit will be used as the baseline information at
      visit 1 for the SD-004 study. The subject will return to the study site for visits 2, 3, 4,
      5, 6, and 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 (at 14, 90, 180, 270, 360, 450, 630, 720, 810,
      900, 990, and 1080 days respectively) to have BSA assessed. For female subjects of
      childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at visits 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
      and 14.
