  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of the gynecologic oncologists with
      palliative care specialist collaboration (GO-PC) intervention on patient quality of life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients include women diagnosed with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer or
      recurrent ovarian cancer cancer. All patient participants will complete two quality of life
      (QOL) questionnaires and a cost-diary documenting their health care experience at time of
      consent and every 12 weeks thereafter. Consenting care givers will also be asked to complete
      two questionnaires to asses the impact of structured palliative care on them every 12 weeks.

      Patients will be assigned to two arms randomly: 1) usual care or 2) structured palliative
      care. The primary endpoint is quality of life. A two-sided Chi-square test will be used to
      compare the proportion of patients who have improved quality of life after treatment between
      control arm and intervention arm. The average value of multiple scores after treatment will
      be used to compare with the baseline score before treatment for each question in the
      standard questionnaire.

    <description>Structured palliative care approach, defined as the gynecologic oncology team performing comprehensive symptom assessment with the Quality Data Collection Tool Palliative Care (QDACT-PC) and providing interventions based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Symptom scores above the acceptable threshold in the QDACT-PC tool that occur after two consecutive visits will automatically trigger palliative care consultation.</description>
