  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to test the hypothesis that in patients with
      stable COPD who use ICS regularly, a single dose of and long-term treatment of 4 weeks with
      roflumilast increase albuterol -induced vasodilation (delta Qaw). These vascular effects of
      roflumilast can be considered to be anti-inflammatory.

      Participants will be enrolled in the study for three months There will be 6 study days
      (visits). The patients will be asked to come to the research laboratory in the morning of
      the study day. They will be instructed to abstain from ingesting alcoholic beverages or
      using PDE5 inhibitors the night before the study, and from consuming coffee or caffeinated
      drinks in the morning of the study day because of their potential acute cardiovascular
      actions. The patients will also be asked not to have a fatty breakfast on the study day to
      avoid potential effects of fat on the absorption of roflumilast.

      The visits will be separated by at least 48 hours. The treatments will be administered in a
      double-blind randomized design, using active roflumilast and identically appearing
      roflumilast placebo provided by Forest.

      Visit 1

      On this visit, a medical history will be obtained from the patients and they will undergo a
      physical examination and complete pulmonary function testing. If they meet entry criteria,
      Qaw will be measured before and 15 min after the inhalation of 180 µg albuterol using a
      spacer (ΔQaw). We have previously shown that vasodilation peaks between 5 and 30 min after
      inhaling this dose of albuterol in healthy non-smokers; in patients with COPD, who exhibit a
      vasodilatory response to inhaled albuterol, the peak effects also occur at the same time as
      in healthy subjects. Since all patients enrolled in the present study will be regular ICS
      users, we expect that all of them will have a vasodilator response to albuterol as
      previously shown.

      Visit 2

      On this day, Qaw will be measured before and at 15, 30, 60,120 and 240 min after the oral
      administration of either 500µg roflumilast or placebo, blinded to patient and investigator
      (acute roflumilast effects).

      Visit 3

      The patients will be given either 500µg roflumilast or placebo (alternate to treatment at
      visit 2) blinded to patient and investigator. One hour later, Qaw will be measured before
      and 15 min after the inhalation of 180µg albuterol using a spacer (ΔQaw). Pharmacokinetic
      studies have shown that the geometric mean plasma concentration of roflumilast after a 500µg
      dose peaks at one hour after oral drug administration.

      The patients will then be randomized in a double blind fashion to either roflumilast 500 µg
      or placebo every morning before breakfast. They will be asked to return for a follow up
      visit 4 weeks later (visit 4).

      Visit 4

      The patients will not take their morning dose (roflumilast or placebo) on this day. Qaw will
      be measured before and 15 min after the inhalation of 180 µg albuterol using a spacer
      (ΔQaw). The treatment will be discontinued and the patients will be asked to return for
      visit 5 after a 4-week washout period.

      Visit 5

      The protocol of visit 4 will be repeated. The patients will then be started on the alternate
      treatment for 4 weeks: Those on roflumilast between visits 3 and 4 will now be placed on
      placebo, and those on placebo between visits 3 and 4 will be placed on roflumilast. The
      patients will be asked to return for a final visit (visit 6) 4 weeks later.

      Visit 6

      The protocol of visit 4 will be repeated. The patients will then undergo an exit exam and be
      discharged from the study

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Twenty-four patients with physician-diagnosed COPD (female and male, current smokers
             or ex-smokers) over the age of 45 years will be recruited for this study.

          -  The patients will have to have a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, and they
             must have been using an ICS regularly for at least 4 weeks at the time of screening.

          -  Confirmation of the diagnosis of COPD will require the presence of persistent
             exertional dyspnea and a post-bronchodilator FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted and

             laboratory. If using roflumilast, the subjects will have to discontinue it 4 weeks
             before entering into the study.-

          -  Use of oral airway medications or anti-inflammatory agents

          -  Use of supplemental oxygen that cannot be discontinued during the laboratory visit
