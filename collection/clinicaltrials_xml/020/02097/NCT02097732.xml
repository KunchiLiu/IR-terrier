  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to test the efficacy of using standard immune therapy for melanoma prior to
      stereotactic radiosurgery (ipilimumab induction), as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery
      followed by immune therapy. The study's hypothesis is that ipilimumab induction is as good
      as or better than controlling brain metastases as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery
      followed by immune therapy.

      This is a randomized Phase II selection study investigating the use of ipilimumab induction
      prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), versus no induction, for melanoma brain
      metastases. Participants will be randomized to Arm A &quot;Induction&quot; (two doses of ipilimumab
      prior to SRS, two doses of ipilimumab after SRS) versus Arm B &quot;No induction&quot; (SRS first,
      followed by 4 doses of ipilimumab). Participants will undergo multiple dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRIs of the brain and submit blood samples for immune testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a histologically-confirmed diagnosis of melanoma who have imaging
             findings suggestive of 1 to 4 brain metastases

          -  At least one lesion in the brain that is measurable, which is defined as ≥5 x 5mm
             (Prior craniotomy and surgical resection is allowed, as long as there is at least one
             remaining measurable lesion in the brain)

          -  Patients must be candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and planning to
             undergo SRS

          -  Patients must be candidates for ipilimumab as determined by the treating physician

          -  Patients must be neurologically asymptomatic, or very minimally symptomatic, as
             judged by the treating physicians

          -  At least 3 weeks has elapsed from any prior therapy, and the patient has recovered

          -  Patients who have previously received ipilimumab, PD-1 inhibitors or PD-L1 inhibitors
             are excluded due to the potential of effects on primary outcome

          -  Patients who require WBRT or surgery at the time of enrollment

          -  Neurologic symptoms or imaging findings that necessitate the use of steroids on the
             day of enrollment or in the prior 7 days
