  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In emergency situations, access to the venous system is essential in order to administer
      fluids and medication and to monitor patients. When peripheral veins are difficult to access
      or the patient's condition requires certain medications, or monitoring, central venous
      catheters (CVC) are inserted. CVC placement introduces a much higher level of risk compared
      to peripheral catheters. The technique of intraosseous (IO) infusion has been used by
      healthcare professionals for several decades, but recently has gained wide popularity in the
      emergency care settings. This technique allows providers to secure a needle in the bony
      matrix at the ends of long bones (tibia and humerus) and infuse fluids and medications into
      the intramedullary space. The ability to monitor a patient's blood pressure through an
      intraosseous needle is unknown. The primary objective of this study is to describe the
      relationship (ratio) of intraosseous pressure (IOP) values to standard pressure values,
      including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial
      pressure (MAP), and central venous pressure (CVP).
