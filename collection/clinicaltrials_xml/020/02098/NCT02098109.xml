  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called filgrastim
      (Neupogen) and plerixafor with the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called XM02
      filgrastim (Granix) and plerixafor.

      This study will compare the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called filgrastim
      (Neupogen) and plerixafor with the results of stem cell mobilization using drugs called XM02
      filgrastim (Granix) and plerixafor. The FDA has determined that Granix is biosimilar to
      Neupogen, which means that they are similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy;
      however, Granix has not been tested in the context of stem cell mobilization to see how its
      effectiveness compares to that of Neupogen

    <measure>Comparison of the CD34+cells/kg yield between the two arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>First day of apheresis. Between-group difference in mean CD34+ counts will be compared using 2-factor ANOVA, including the status of randomization, type of disease, and the corresponding interaction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of adverse events (safety) between the two arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 20 days after last aphereis (Day 25-Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Number and percentage of patients who experienced AEs for each system organ class and specific AE will be presented. Multiple instances of the AEs in each system organ class and multiple occurrences of the same AE are counted only once per patient (reported as the highest grade experienced).
AEs will be assessed using CTCAE version 4.0</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of the rate of neutrophil engraftment between the two arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Time to neutrophil engraftment is measured by determining the first of 3 consecutive measurements of neutrophil count ≥ 500/µl following conditioning regimen-induced nadir. Patients who do not have neutrophil engraftment by Day 30 post-infusion of mobilized PBSC product will be considered a neutrophil engraftment failure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of the percentage of patients who collect ≥ 2.0x10^6 CD34+cells/kg and ≥ 5.0x10^6 CD34+cells/kg, respectively, following PBSC mobilization between the two arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 8</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of the percentage of patients who collect ≥ 2.0x10^6 CD34+cells/kg and ≥ 5.0x10^6 CD34+cells/kg, respectively, in one apheresis procedure following PBSC mobilization between the two arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 8</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of the rate of platelet engraftment between the two arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Time to platelet engraftment is measured by determining the first of 3 consecutive measurements of platelet count ≥ 50,000/µl without platelet transfusion support for 7 days. Patients who do not have platelet engraftment by Day 100 post-infusion of mobilized PBSC product will be considered a platelet engraftment failure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of the readmission rate between the two arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Readmission rate is defined as the frequency at which patients are readmitted (after initial post-transplant discharge) following post-infusion of mobilized PBSC product for reasons other than progressive disease/relapse</description>
