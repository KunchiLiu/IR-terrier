  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This current study will use a new treatment approach based on each patient's tumor genomic
      profiling consisting of whole genome sequencing, exome analysis, and RNA sequencing as well
      as predictive modeling. This new treatment strategy has shown promising results in adult
      patients with other solid tumors.

      The current study will test the feasibility of a specialized Tumor Board assigning a
      treatment plan within 35 calendar days of obtaining tumor tissue. The treatment plan will
      take into consideration each patient's tumor molecular profile and predictive modeling as
      well as prior history and treatment(s), and other medical conditions of the patient.

      Patients with recurrent glioblastoma who are candidates for surgery for their clinical
      management will have tumor tissue taken at the time of surgery. Tissue samples will be
      obtained from the contrasting edge as well as infiltrating margins. Circulating tumor DNA
      will also be taken from blood samples before, and after surgery and every 2 months. Genomic
      profiling of the tumor tissue will be performed and a Molecular Tumor Board will review the
      profiling within 28 to 35 days of surgery. If specific potential targets are amenable to
      treatment, a treatment recommendation will be made. Up to 4 drugs could be suggested to the
      treating physician. The patient and the treating physician may or may not choose to use the
      recommendation. Any drug from the US Pharmacopeia may be chosen. If the treatment as
      suggested is given, patients will be followed for toxicity and efficacy, including
      progression and survival. If the treatment is not given, patients will be followed for
      progression and survival.
