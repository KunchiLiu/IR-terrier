  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use MRI brain imaging to identify brain changes associated in stroke patients
      after they receive speech-language treatment for their speech difficulties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the current study are to identify grey and white matter regions that are
      predictive of speech treatment response and measure neural plasticity in response to speech
      treatment, using state-of-the-art neuroimaging and statistical processing techniques in a
      group of well-characterized left hemisphere patients meeting strict inclusionary criteria.
      Specifically, the investigators will use voxel-based lesion symptom mapping to identify
      lesion sites most predictive of a positive response to speech treatment and advanced
      diffusion imaging techniques to map changes in the integrity of white matter tracts from
      pre- to post-treatment.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, three target sounds will be chosen, and these may be single consonants, vowels, or clusters at the word level. Twenty items for each speech sound will be developed: 10 which will serve as Trained items and 10 which will serve as untrained items. The trained and untrained items will be balanced according to syllabic structure, word frequency, grammatical form class, and stress pattern. The trained items will allow us to measure acquisition effects, and the untrained items will allow us to measure generalization effects of SPT.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fractional anisotropy</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure neuroplasticity associated with the speech treatment protocol, the investigators will calculate the difference in fractional anisotropy values from pre- to post-treatment for each of the eight fiber tracts in the left hemisphere.</description>

    <description>This treatment employs a response-contingent hierarchy made up of verbal modeling/repetition, graphic cueing, integral stimulation, and articulatory placement instruction. The investigators chose this treatment for the following reasons: 1) rigor of development demonstrated across multiple studies, 2) large and predictable effects with published, quantified effect sizes, 3) a demonstrated pattern of generalization to untrained items, illustrating experimental control, 4) an established multi-modal stimulation protocol, and 5) use of repeated practice, which is associated with neural plasticity.</description>
