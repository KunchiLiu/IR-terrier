      This study is being done to evaluate the scheduled use of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen
      among cesarean section patients. The study hopes to find out if patients who receive
      scheduled IV acetaminophen for 48 hours following delivery have lower self-reported pain
      scores and use less narcotic pain medication than patients who do not receive IV
      acetaminophen.

    <description>Post operative pain will be assessed every 8 hours (prior to the administration of the study drug) and prior to the administration of any breakthrough pain medication for 48 hours after surgery. Pain will be self reported by patients using the Faces Pain Scale - Revised that is already present in all patient rooms.</description>
