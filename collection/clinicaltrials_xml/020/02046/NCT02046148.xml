      Evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the trivalent group B streptococcus vaccine in
      healthy pregnant women. The study will also evaluate the levels of GBS serotype-specific
      antibodies in infants, placental transfer from the pregnant women to the infant and levels
      of antibodies in the breast milk.
