    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of flexibly dosed lurasidone (20 - 80 mg/day) for 6 weeks compared
      with placebo in children and adolescent subjects with depression associated with Bipolar I
      Disorder (bipolar depression).

                  test for amphetamines/methamphetamines, barbiturates, opioids, or

                  determines that the positive test is as a result of taking prescription
                  medicine(s) as prescribed. In the event a subject tests positive for
                  cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol), the investigator will evaluate the

                  the investigator's clinical judgment the subject will abstain, the subject may
                  be enrolled after consultation with the Medical Monitor.
