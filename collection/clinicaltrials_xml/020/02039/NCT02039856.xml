  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VA has undertaken a major initiative to transform care through implementation of Patient
      Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). Based on the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) concept, PACT
      aims to improve access, continuity, coordination and comprehensiveness using team-based care
      that is patient-driven and patient-centered. However, how VA should adapt PACT to meet the
      needs of special populations, such as women Veterans, is yet to be worked out. The main goal
      of this study is to develop and test an evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) approach
      to adapting and implementing PACT for women Veterans, incorporating comprehensive women's
      health care in gender-sensitive care environments, thereby accelerating achievement of PACT
      tenets for women Veterans and reducing persistent gender disparities in VA quality of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women Veterans' numerical minority in VA healthcare settings has created logistical
      challenges to delivering gender-sensitive comprehensive services. These challenges have only
      grown as more women Veterans have enrolled in VA care. Access and quality have lagged behind
      that of male Veterans, while gender sensitivity, including adequate attention to
      privacy/safety and awareness of women's military roles and experiences, is often lacking.
      On-site availability of gender-specific services has also not kept pace, with women Veterans
      more likely to be outsourced for gender-specific care now than they were ten years ago.
      Further, while the proportion of VA facilities having women's health (WH) clinics has
      increased, prior research has demonstrated that as many as 40% of them were not delivering
      comprehensive primary care services, instead focusing only on gender-specific exams. Lack of
      gender-sensitive, comprehensive care for women has also been associated with measurable
      decrements in women's ratings of VA access, continuity and coordination, as well as measures
      of technical quality.

      The investigators aim to assess the effectiveness of evidence-based quality improvement
      (EBQI) methods for developing a WH PACT model using a cluster randomized trial design (Aim
      #1); examine impacts of receipt of WH-PACT concordant care on women Veterans' outcomes (Aim
      #2); evaluate processes of EBQI-supported WH-PACT implementation (Aim #3); and develop
      implementation and evaluation tools for use in EBQI-supported WH-PACT model adaptation,
      implementation, sustainability and spread to additional VA facilities (Aim #4).

      EBQI is a systematic approach to developing a multi-level research-clinical partnership
      approach to engaging local organizational senior leaders and quality improvement teams in
      adapting and implementing new care models in the context of prior evidence, local practice
      context, and provider behavior change methods, with researchers providing technical support
      and practice facilitation. In a cluster randomized trials, the investigators will evaluate
      WH-PACT model achievement using patient, provider and practice surveys. The investigators
      will examine intermediate changes in provider, staff and team knowledge and attitudes. Using
      analyses of secondary administrative and performance data, the investigators will also
      explore impacts of receipt of WH-PACT care on quality of chronic disease care and
      prevention, health status, utilization and costs. Using mixed methods, the investigators
      will assess pre-post EBQI practice context; document WH-PACT implementation; and examine
      barriers/facilitators to EBQI-supported WH-PACT implementation through a combination of
      semi-structured interviews and monthly formative progress narratives and administrative data
      review.
