  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2140944 belongs to a novel structural class of antibiotics - Bacterial Type II
      Topoisomerase Inhibitors (BTI). This is a Phase II, randomized, two-part, multicenter study
      designed to select the optimal dose by further characterizing the safety, tolerability and
      PK of GSK 2140944 and by evaluating efficacy in subjects requiring in-patient medical care
      to treat their suspected or confirmed Gram-positive acute bacterial skin and skin structure
      infections (ABSSSI). The selected dose will be used in future studies.

    <measure>Composite of the cure rate at the Early Efficacy Visit combined with withdrawal rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Cure rate and withdrawal rate data points will be jointly assessed in a composite endpoint for all subjects who received at least one dose of GSK2140944. Cure rate is defined as the percentage of subjects exhibiting clinical improvement (=&gt;20% reduction in overall lesion area) at the Early Efficacy Visit. Withdrawal rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who withdraw from study treatment due to a drug-related AE at any point while on treatment.</description>

    <measure>Clinical response and outcome at the Post-Therapy Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 12 to Day 18</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical outcome will be determined by comparing the signs and symptoms of infection and lesion area at the Post-Therapy Visit to those present at the Baseline Visit. Clinical outcome will be determined for subjects who were assessed as either a clinical success or a clinical failure (if they continued in the study and on study medication and did not receive any alternative antibacterial therapy) at the Early Efficacy Visit. Clinical response will subsequently be determined programmatically, based on the recorded clinical outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 21 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>At the Final Follow-Up Visit the clinical signs and symptoms of infection will be evaluated for subjects who were a clinical success at the Post-Therapy Visit and determine whether a satisfactory outcome was maintained or whether a recurrence of signs and symptoms of infection has occurred. Clinical response will subsequently be determined programmatically, based on the recorded clinical outcome.</description>

             in doubt, a documented previous confirmatory blood sample with follicle-stimulating
             hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 milli-international units per milliliter (MIU/mL) and estradiol
             &lt;40 picograms per milliliter (&lt;140 picomole per liter) would need to be confirmed or

             2 days.. ABSSSI is defined as one of the following: Wound infection (traumatic or
             post-surgical): an infection involving skin and subcutaneous tissue, characterized by
             purulent drainage from a wound with surrounding redness, edema, and/or induration of
             a minimum surface area of 75 square centimeter (cm^2) (e.g., the shortest distance of
             redness, edema, and/or induration extending at least 5 centimeter (cm) from the

             by a collection of pus within the dermis or deeper that is accompanied by redness,
             edema, and/or induration of a minimum surface area of 75 cm^2 (e.g., the shortest
             distance of redness, edema, and/or induration extending at least 5 cm from the
             peripheral margin of the abscess). Cellulitis: a diffuse skin infection characterized

             multiple lesions of the same type, the investigator must clearly identify the lesion
             to be evaluated for study purposes. The identified lesion must be consistently chosen
             for assessment (including digital imaging) throughout the study. Incision and
             drainage (I&amp;D) of the lesion is permitted prior to the first dose of study medication
             and will be allowed, per protocol, up to 24 hours after the start of the first dose
             of study medication.

             infection OR show microbiological evidence of failure; The subject recently completed
             a treatment course with an antibacterial drug for an infection other than ABSSSI and
             the drug does not have antibacterial activity against bacterial pathogens that cause
             ABSSSI. (Note: topical antiseptics, chorhexidine, and alcohol and soaps for wound
             care are permitted). For the purposes of these criteria, the information may be
             obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical
             records; information obtained via a verbal interview must be recorded in the
             subject's medical record.

          -  The subject has known or suspected severe impairment of renal function, including a
             calculated creatinine clearance (as calculated using the Cockroft-Gault method) of
             less than 30 millilitre per minute; requirement for peritoneal dialysis,
             hemodialysis, or hemofiltration; or oliguria (less than 20 millilitre urine output
             per hour over 24 hours).

          -  The subject has known or suspected chronic neutropenia due to suppression of
             neutrophil production, or is anticipated to develop neutropenia during the course of
             the study (ie. new chemotherapy subject), with absolute neutrophil count less than
             1000 cells/mm^3 (subjects with neutrophil counts as low as 500 cell/mm^3 are eligible
             if the reduction is due entirely to the acute infectious process).

          -  The subject has been previously enrolled in this study, or has previously been
             treated with GSK2140944.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer
