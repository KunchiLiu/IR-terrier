    <textblock>
      This is an open label study in children with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis
      (PFIC) designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LUM001. Efficacy will be assessed by
      evaluating the effect of LUM001 on the biochemical markers and pruritus associated with
      PFIC.

             or 5 half-lives of the study agent, whichever is longer.

         16. History of non-adherence to medical regimens, unreliability, mental instability or
