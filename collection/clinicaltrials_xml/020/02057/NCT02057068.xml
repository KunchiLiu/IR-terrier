      This study addresses the neglected topic of sleep disturbance in older caregiving dyads-a
      topic that has important implications for the safety, health, functioning and quality of
      life of older Veterans living at home and being cared for by a family caregiver (CG). The
      purpose of the first phase of this study is determine the relationship between CG and care
      recipient (CR) sleep and describe the impact of dyadic sleep to daytime functioning and
      well-being for Veterans and their caregivers. The information from phase 1 will inform the
      next study phase in which the investigators develop and field test non-pharmacological,
      technology based, sleep hygiene, exercise and meditation interventions to improve sleep in
      Veteran caregiving dyads.

      Objective: The primary objective of this study to develop and field test
      non-pharmacological, technology based, psycho-educational and behavioral (exercise and
      meditation) interventions to improve sleep in Veteran/caregiver dyads.

      Research Plan: The specific objectives will be accomplished through the execution of a three
      phase strategy: 1) an evaluation phase, 2) a development and preliminary intervention field
      testing phase, and 3) an intervention refinement, revision and re-testing phase. All studies
      will use samples of Veteran care receivers (CR s) over the age of 60 who require assistance
      from a spousal or cohabitating caregiver (CG). A sub-study will include the same collection
      of data, however using non-Veteran care receivers (CR) over the age of 60 who require
      assistance from a spousal or cohabitating caregiver (CG).

      Study 1 is a cross-sectional study which focuses on the Sleep Evaluation of 124 CG/CR Dyads.
      In SLEEP-E Dyads 1 actigraphy will be used to objectively and contemporaneously measure
      dyadic sleep. Daily journals will be used to collect CG/CR self-reported sleep quality,
      daytime mood and behavior and to identify the nature and types of sleep disturbance.
      Electronic Tablets (E-Tabs) will be introduced, evaluated and validated with half the dyads.
      Pre and post journal video greetings will be tested and evaluated during this phase. Data
      from SLEEP-E Dyads 1 will be analyzed and inform the developmental tasks and activities for
      the next phase of the study. An additional sub-sample of caregiving dyads (non-Veterans)
      will be recruited to implement the same study design and to compare data to Veteran
      caregiving dyad data.

      The focus of SLEEP-E Dyads 2 is on Sleep Enhancement for CG/CR Dyads. This phase involves
      the adaptation, implementation and field testing of interventions with proven efficacy in
      other populations for use with Veteran dyads and the development of new interventions using
      selected components from evidence based sleep interventions. The intervention will be tested
      on 12 dyads stratified by dementia status. The tele-health device will be used to collect
      daily diary information during this phase and to deliver the sleep hygiene educational and
      cognitive behavior therapy components of the intervention.

      In SLEEP-E Dyads 3 feedback from the CGs regarding the acceptability of the intervention
      will be processed and analyzed in addition to preliminary outcome data. The intervention
      will be refined accordingly and the revised intervention will be tested with 44 dyads
      stratified by dementia status.

      Methods: All study phases involve comprehensive assessments of sleep and daytime
      functioning, mood and behavior using standardized validated instruments in addition to
      subjective data from the dyad as well as objective sleep evaluations with contemporaneous
      wrist actigraphy measured over seven days.

      Clinical Relevance: This study addresses the neglected topic of sleep disturbance in older
      caregiving dyads-a topic that has important implications for the safety, health, functioning
      and QOL of older Veterans living at home and being cared for by a family caregiver. Because
      of the inter-related, bi-directional nature of sleep to stress, burden and depression, the
      most efficacious interventions should be ones which consider risk factors as they relate to
      the sleep of both members of a dyad. Yet, this study is the first to attempt to elucidate
      the dynamic relationship between CG and care recipient sleep and the impact of dyadic sleep
      to daytime functioning and well-being with Veterans and their caregivers.

      These activities will lead to the implementation and evaluation of a definitive randomized
      clinical trial for CG/CR dyads and make a significant and important contribution to
      complement the emergent program of caregiver research in the VA devoted to improving quality
      of life for Veterans and their families.
