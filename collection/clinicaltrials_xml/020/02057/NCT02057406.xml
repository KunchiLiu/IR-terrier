      Omega 3 supplements will improve depressive symptoms to a greater extent than placebo in
      heart failure patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether (Hypothesis 1a) and how
      (Hypothesis 1b) the two omega 3 supplements will reduce depressive symptoms in heart failure
      (HF) patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder (MDD).

      Hypothesis 1a: Omega 3 supplements will improve depressive symptoms to a greater extent than
      placebo; Hypothesis 1b: Pure eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) will be superior to the EPA:
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 2:1 in depression improvement.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male and female patients, age greater than or equal to 21 years

          -  Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder determined by the DSM-IV-TR criteria with a
             Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score greater than or equal to 18*

          -  New York Heart Association Class greater than or equal to II

               -  For patients with with left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40 %,
                  abnormal brain natriuretic peptide and/or previous hospitalization due to heart
                  failure is also required

               -  For inpatients, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores need to be remain at
                  18 or above for two weeks following the discharge

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant cognitive impairment, indicated as a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
             total score of 23 or lower

          -  History of alcohol or other drug dependence within the past 90 days

          -  Severe physical disability (visual, sensory, or motor) that may interfere with
             psychiatric assessment

          -  History or presence of psychoses, bipolar disorder, and/or severe personality
             disorders

          -  Life-threatening comorbidity with the likelihood of 50% mortality in one year

          -  Active suicidal ideations

          -  Current use of antipsychotic medications or psychotropic medications except SSRIs and
             /or benzodiazepine

          -  Female patients who have a positive pregnancy test or are lactating. If female
             patients are of childbearing potential, they must use an effective and accepted means
             of contraception, such as oral contraceptives or a double-barrier method (condom and
             diaphragm) to protect against pregnancy

          -  Documented history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to omega 3 products; or use of
             omega 3 supplement for greater than or equal to 3 months at an equivalent or greater
             dose of the proposed study

          -  Treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation
             (TMS) within 90 days*

          -  Uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 1 month before randomization

          -  Acute coronary syndrome, i.e., MI or unstable angina, revascularization procedure
             within the preceding month, or planned cardiac surgery within 3 months
             postrandomization

               -  The exclusion of patients who received ECT or TMS within 90 days is adopted from
                  other depression-intervention trials and meant to eliminate confounders. It is
                  believed that the effects of ECT on mood and cognition may last for a couple of
                  months, and duration of TMS effects is poorly known and may be similar to the
                  ECT intervention.
