    <textblock>
      Patients with mitochondrial diseases, who are ≥ 2 years old and &lt; 18 years, will be included
      in this study. It is anticipated that approximately one half of subjects will have
      genetically confirmed Leigh Syndrome. Up to 25 patients will be enrolled if there is no
      toxicity up to the level of 1.3 g/m2/day of RP103. Interim analyses will occur after 4 and
      then 12 subjects complete the study through Week 24. If the study is not stopped early,
      final analysis will occur after 25 subjects have completed through Week 24.

      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Cysteamine Bitartrate Delayed-release Capsules
      (RP103) for treatment of children with inherited mitochondrial disease.

      Patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases associated with nuclear or mitochondrial DNA
      mutations that impair the respiratory chain. These include, but are not limited to the
      following clinical syndromes: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy; myoclonic epilepsy and
      ragged-red fibers (MERFF); mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike
      syndrome (MELAS); KearnSayre syndrome; subacute necrotizing encephalopathy (Leigh Syndrome);
      POLGrelated disorders (Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome, Autosomal Dominant Progressive External
      Ophthalmoplegia, Autosomal Recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia, Childhood
      Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum Disorders, Myoclonic Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia,
      POLGRelated Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders); Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal
      encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE), also called myoneurogastrointestinal encephalopathy
      syndrome or POLIP syndrome; others, e.g., mitochondrial cardiomyopathies and other syndromes
      due to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions.

      Prior to treatment, patients will undergo a Screening Visit. If eligible, each subject will
      return for the Day 1 study visit and begin RP103 dosing on that day. Every 2 weeks over the
      subsequent 8 weeks, subjects will alternate between returning to the clinic for detailed
      assessments (Weeks 4 and 8) and receiving a telephone call from the Investigator team to
      assess safety and RP103 dose (Weeks 2 and 6) and the potential need for an immediate
      unscheduled study visit. Thereafter, subjects will continue to return to the clinic every 4
      weeks for detailed assessments at Weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24 (the Study Exit visit). The Week
      24 visit will be the same as the Study Exit visit (i.e. a single visit rather two separate
      ones) if a subject elects to continue on to the RP103-MITO-002 (NCT02473445) extension
      study, and that study has been IRB approved at the site or if the subject does not continue
      on to the extension study. If the extension study has not yet been IRB approved by the time
      a subject reaches Week 24, and that subject elects to continue on RP103, then Study Exit
      visit will take place later and separately from the Week 24 visit.

      The extension study will continue until results of the present RP103-MITO-001 study are
      known.

             ataxia (FRDA)

          4. Moderate disease severity based on Newcastle Pediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale
             (NPMD) score, with a score between 15 to 45 inclusive [LHON subjects are exempt of
             this inclusion criteria], if approved by the sponsor.

          5. For patients regularly taking dietary supplements such as creatinine, alpha-lipoic
             acid, CoQ10, vitamin B, carnitine, etc. they have to have been taking them for at
             least 3 months pre-study and will agree to keep these the same throughout the study
             (from the Screening Visit to Study Exit)

          6. With respect to concomitant medications, the subject must:

               1. Be willing to abstain from initiating dietary supplements and non-prescribed
                  medications, except as allowed by the Investigator, throughout the study (from
                  the Screening Visit to Study Exit);

               2. Be on a stable dose of medications prescribed for seizure management and
                  prevention. Stable dose in this context means unchanged for at least 30 days
                  prior to the Screening Visit.

          7. Willing and able to comply with study drug dosing requirements, i.e. ingest the RP103
             capsules intact, or sprinkled in liquid or soft food, or using a g-tube

             sterile [tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy]) must agree to
             utilize two of the following acceptable forms of contraception throughout the study
             (from the Screening Visit to Study Exit):

               1. Hormonal contraception: birth control pills, injection, patch, vaginal ring or
                  implant;

               2. Condom or diaphragm, with spermicide;

               3. Intrauterine device (IUD)

               4. Sterile male partner (vasectomy performed at least 6 months prior to the study).

          9. Subjects's legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent;
             Subject must provide assent, if required by local/institutional requirements

         10. Have mitochondrial myopathy as evidenced by one or more of the following criteria:

               1. Weakness consistent with myopathy (e.g. accompanied by muscle wasting and/or
                  absence of neuropathy) on physical exam

               2. OR documented myopathy on the basis of muscle biopsy consistent with
                  mitochondrial myopathy disease

               3. OR weakness and/or progressive exercise intolerance (in which modest exercise
                  typically provokes heaviness, weakness, aching of active muscles, or
                  tachycardia). Weakness should be due to myopathy and not neuropathy or other
                  causes as deemed by investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented diagnosis of concurrent inborn errors of metabolism

          2. Non-elective hospitalization relative to mitochondrial disease or direct complication
             of disease within 60 days prior to the Screening Visit.

          3. Platelet count, lymphocyte count or hemoglobin below the lower limit of normal (LLN)
