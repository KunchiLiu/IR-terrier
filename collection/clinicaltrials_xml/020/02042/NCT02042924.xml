  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot sub-study of patients receiving myeloablative transplant using total body
      irradiation (TBI) or total marrow irradiation (TMI) in their preparative regimen. The
      objective of this stub-study is to estimate the heterogeneity in cellular proliferation
      (FLT-PET uptake) as well the heterogeneity in marrow composition distribution (measured
      using whole body water-fat MRI) using positron emission tomography imaging. This will be
      used to design future trials as well as to determine the feasibility of PET and MRI imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of hematologic malignancy and fitting into one of the following categories:

               -  Newly diagnosed and/or day 14 post-induction chemotherapy

               -  Relapsed, including relapse after hematopoietic cell transplant

               -  Planned hematopoietic cell transplant (if enrolling at &quot;close&quot;) or within 100
                  days post hematopoietic cell transplant (if enrolling post-transplant) with a
                  preparative regimen that includes either total marrow irradiation (TMI) or total
                  body irradiation (TBI)

               -  Undergoing natural killer cell therapies (with or without subsequent transplant)

          -  Aged 18 years and older

          -  Not pregnant - women of childbearing potential will have a confirmatory pregnancy
             test prior to each imaging per routine procedures

          -  Adequate renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 60 ml/min) as
             determined by a serum creatinine level performed as a part of standard of care within
             7 days of imaging

          -  Able and willing to provide written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Otherwise eligible patients meeting one or more of the contraindicates for an MRI,
             may enroll in the study without undergoing the MRI:

               -  ferromagnetic implants

               -  history of shrapnel or shot gun injury

               -  too large to fit in the magnet (approximate body mass index â‰¥ 40)

               -  cardiac pacemakers or other implanted devices that are not MR-compatible

               -  claustrophobia

               -  large tattoos
