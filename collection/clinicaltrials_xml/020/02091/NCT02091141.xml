  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate four treatment
      regimens in patients with advanced cancer for whom there is no available, beneficial
      treatment. Patients with HER2 overexpression, amplification, or -activating mutation will be
      treated with Herceptin/Perjeta; those with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with
      Tarceva; those with BRAF-activating mutation, with Zelboraf/Cotellic; and those with Hedehog
      pathway potentially clinically relevant mutation, with Erivedge. Treatment will continue
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Study is expected to last up to 5
      years.
