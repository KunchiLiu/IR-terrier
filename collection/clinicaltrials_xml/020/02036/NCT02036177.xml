  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SCu300A IUB™ (hereafter IUB™) will be evaluated for safety and effectiveness in
      comparison with a market approved standard T shaped IUD containing 380sq.mm. of copper:

      Comparison of objective parameters - Pregnancy rate, perforation, expulsion and malposition
      rates, changes in the endometrial thickness, rate of complications such as infection and
      anemia and discontinuation rates after 1 year.

      Comparison of Subjective parameters - pain during insertion, menstrual characteristics and
      pain, bleeding in correlation to the bleeding pattern prior to insertion.

      Physician opinion: ease of use in insertion and removal. Subject satisfaction.

      It is expected that subjects using the copper IUB will demonstrate less safety events, equal
      effectiveness and equal or improved menstrual bleeding and pain related profiles compared
      with users of the T shaped copper IUD.
