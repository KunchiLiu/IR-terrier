  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety and efficacy study of ertugliflozin (MK-8835/PF-04971729) in the treatment
      of participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control on
      metformin and sitagliptin. The primary objective of the trial is to assess the hemoglobin
      A1C (A1C)-lowering efficacy of the addition of ertugliflozin compared to the addition of
      placebo with an underlying hypothesis that addition of treatment with ertugliflozin provides
      greater reduction in A1C compared with the addition of placebo; the primary objective will
      be tested for both 5-mg and 15-mg doses of ertugliflozin.

      The duration of the trial will be approximately 69 weeks. This will include a 1-week
      Screening Period, an up to 12-week wash-off/titration /dose-stabilization period, a 2-week
      single-blind, placebo run-in period, a 52-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment
      period (including a 26-week Phase A and 26-week Phase B), and a post-treatment telephone
      contact 14 days after the last dose of blinded investigational product.
