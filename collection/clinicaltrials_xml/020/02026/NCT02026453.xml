  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will test two interventions to improve the accuracy of medication histories obtained at
      hospital admission. The interventions will target elderly and chronically ill patients prone
      to erroneous medication histories and resultant medication errors. For targeted patients, we
      will test the effect of using pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to obtain an initial
      medication history. This will be studied using a randomized controlled trial of usual care
      (which involves nurses and physicians) vs usual care + pharmacists vs usual care + pharmacy
      technicians to obtain an admission medication history.

      Our overarching hypothesis is that by leveraging pharmacists and pharmacy technicians we can
      minimize admission medication history errors and related downstream events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At a large university-affiliated hospital, we conducted an IRB-approved, pragmatic
      randomized trial with informed consent waived.

      Inclusion criteria, accessed via EHR, were: &gt;=10 chronic prescription medications, history
      of acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, admission from skilled nursing
      facility, history of transplant, or active anticoagulant, insulin, or narrow therapeutic
      index medications; excluded if admitted to pediatric or trauma services or transplant
      services with pharmacists.

      All arms received usual care for patients admitted from the emergency department. This
      included RNs obtaining AMHs, and natural variation in checking, correcting and ordering from
      these AMHs by admitting providers. In the two intervention arms, PSPTs and pharmacists
      obtained initial AMHs. They contacted family, pharmacies,and/or providers to resolve
      questions. As per prior studies, we obtained reference standard AMHs from all patients
      (usually one day after admission), and initial AMH errors were independently rated by &gt;=2
      pharmacists as significant, serious, or life-threatening. These three error severities were
      assigned 1, 4, and 9 points, respectively. We calculated weighted error scores for each
      patient, and mean scores/pt for each arm. We had 80% power to identify arms with
      higher/lower scores of &gt;=11.2/patient.

    <description>The project was originally funded to measure the effect of these interventions on medication history errors. We are currently applying for more funding which would allow us to use the more meaningful, more downstream outcome of medication order errors, and this will become the primary outcome if funding for such is received.</description>
