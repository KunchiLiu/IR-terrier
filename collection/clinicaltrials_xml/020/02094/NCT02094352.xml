  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether epidural and ketamine infusions are
      effective in the treatment of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).

      Potential patients must clear all study requirements to be enrolled. Study requirements
      include labwork, psychiatric evaluation, and cardiology evaluation.

      Once enrolled, patients will be in one of two groups:

        1. Receives epidural infusion

        2. Receives epidural and ketamine infusions

      The patient and study staff are blinded.

      This study requires multiple visits to Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City over
      the course of three months and concludes with a final visit after six months. The study will
      only cover costs associated with the scheduled in-patient and out-patient visits. The study
      patient will be responsible for all other costs (including travel and hotel accommodations)
      that he/she may incur for participating in this study.
