      Study hypothesis: Do serial low-dose ketamine infusions, followed by weekly maintenance
      infusions, increase the length of time depressive symptoms stay in remission and the length
      of time associated suicide risk is improved?

      Brief Summary: This open label clinical trial is intended to further clarify initial
      response to low-dose ketamine infusion with repeated dosing and maintenance treatment model.
      Primary outcomes will be reduction in depression severity and reduction of suicide risk
      along with duration of response.
