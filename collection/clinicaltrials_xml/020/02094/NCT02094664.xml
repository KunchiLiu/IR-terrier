  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare heat and humidified oxygen with cold and dry oxygen
      in children with bronchiolitis.

      The hypotheses are that heating and humidifying inspired low flow supplemental oxygen will
      optimize mucociliary function thereby, 1) improve oxygenation, 2) decrease work of
      breathing, and 3) decrease length of hospital stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of acute respiratory illness and hospitalization in
      infants and young children. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, which includes
      frequent nasal suctioning, intravenous fluid hydration, and supplemental oxygen for
      hypoxemia.

      The airways normally heat and humidify inspired ambient air to core temperature amd 100%
      relative humidity at the carina. This environment, at core temperature, allows for optimal
      mucociliary clearance. Supplemental oxygen delivered via wall source is cold and dry, and
      does not reach core temperature and 100% humidity until some point distal to the carina,
      past the main bronchi. This presses on the lower respiratory tract to assist in heat and
      moisture exchange and thus decrease ciliary function. This, in combination with
      bronchiolitis, can impair mucociliary clearance.

      Specific aim 1: Determine the effect of heated and humidified oxygen therapy on clinical
      improvement in children with bronchiolitis, based on Respiratory Distress Assessment
      Instrument (RDAI) and respiratory rate (RR).

      Specific aim 2: Determine the effect of heated and humidified oxygen therapy on length of
      hospital stay and duration of supplemental oxygen requirement in children with
      bronchiolitis.
