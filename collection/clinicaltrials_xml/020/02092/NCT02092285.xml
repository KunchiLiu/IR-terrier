The second induction dose of SC golimumab 100 mg will be administered two weeks later at Visit 3 (Week 2). Responders at Visit 4 (Week 6) will receive a maintenance dose of golimumab (50 mg for participants with a body weight &lt;80 kg or 100 mg for participants with a body weight ≥80 kg) every 4 weeks during the Maintenance Phase for 48 weeks, yielding a total of 54 weeks treatment.</description>
