  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we would like to demonstrate that epidural stimulation can be used to recover
      significant levels of autonomic control of the cardiovascular and respiratory function as
      well as the ability to voluntarily control leg movements below the injury level. This
      intervention would provide an immediate therapeutic alternative to individuals who now have
      no recourse for treatment.

      Rationale:

      We propose to determine the functional gain that can be achieved in voluntary control of
      movements below the level of injury and autonomic nervous system function as a result of
      activation of spinal circuits with epidural stimulation (ES) in humans with complete motor
      paralysis. In addition to the scientific advances, the proposed experiments are essential to
      translating this therapeutic approach to a larger scale, which is needed to have a
      meaningful clinical impact. ES for recovery of neurological function in patients with severe
      SCI is not widely used because of uncertainty regarding the mechanisms of action and
      convincing evidence of efficacy in a larger numbers of subjects. Our approach will allow us
      to determine specific types of ES needed for voluntary movement and autonomic nervous system
      dysfunction which lays the groundwork for expedient translation to larger numbers of
      individuals with SCI.

      Current clinical methods of diagnosis of clinically complete SCI may not be sensitive enough
      to detect residual functional synapses across the lesion. We propose to use a series of
      neurophysiological approaches that can detect different sources of supraspinal influence on
      spinal circuitry and identify specific pathways including vestibulospinal, reticulospinal,
      corticospinal and long propriospinal pathways that may remain viable or emerge with ES and
      task specific training after complete motor paralysis. Such residual connectivity would be
      identified by the presence of voluntarily controlled movement or evoked motor potentials
      occurring only in the presence of epidural stimulation. Identifying the essential
      supraspinal-spinal pathways needed to recovery these voluntary movements will advance our
      knowledge of human neural control of movement and provide critical information for
      developing repair and regeneration strategies and in determining the type and severity of
      patient that could benefit most readily in regaining voluntary control using epidural
      stimulation.

      Methods and Procedures

        1. General Experimental Design. We will enroll 4 research participants who have sustained
           a motor complete SCI to participate in the proposed experiments. Our novel approach of
           conducting repeated experiments with comprehensive assessments in a smaller cohort of
           patients rather than a more traditional approach of including a large number of
           patients and focusing on a single outcome allows advancing both clinical and scientific
           knowledge. We have found success with the smaller cohort approach because we can employ
           more rigorous, quantitative and sensitive outcomes that not only inform us about the
           potential clinical efficacy but also provide further knowledge of the mechanisms of
           neural control of movement and other physiological mechanisms related to
           cardiovascular, respiratory and function and voluntary control of movement.

        2. Research participant enrollment. Each research participant will be screened for medical
           eligibility by the neurosurgeon and physiatrist and for scientific eligibility by the
           site principal investigator (see Human Subjects section below). After eligibility is
           determined and consent procedures are implemented, the individual will undergo all
           clinical and neurophysiological assessments for voluntary movement, cardiovascular and
           respiratory function. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be conducted at the time of
           enrollment to establish structural integrity of the nerve tissue and to establish the
           severity of injury and diffuse tensor imaging to establish the axonal integrity. A
           standard MRI of the area of injury will be conducted and it will be read by a
           radiologist and the following measures will be made: 1) the number of sagittal cuts in
           which the signal change is present, 2) maximum height of signal change, 3) maximum area
           of signal change, 4) maximal canal compromise will calculated (MCC) and 5) maximal
           spinal cord compression (MSCC). All of these measurements will be made on the mid
           sagittal view.

      The individual will continue with their current daily activities for 4 months without any
      intervention (usual care) followed by all assessments. Surgical implantation of the 5-6-5
      Specify electrode, and Restore Advance Pulse generator, (MEDTRONIC, Minneapolis, MN, USA)
      encompassing the lumbosacral spinal cord guided by neurophysiological mapping will then
      occur (implant).

      ES is administered by a multi-electrode array implanted in the epidural space over the
      dorsum of cord. An implanted package containing stimulating circuits, rechargeable battery,
      and wireless communication activates the electrodes (16 platinum electrodes arranged in
      three columns of [5-6-5]). The pattern of electrically active electrodes, as well as
      electrode voltage, stimulating frequency, and stimulating pulse width can be remotely
      programmed. Since different spatial activation patterns and different frequency parameters
      affect different spinal circuits, the array can be reconfigured, within limits, to bias its
      facilitating effects toward different activities, such as cardiovascular control or
      voluntary movement.

      Clinical and neurophysiological assessments will be repeated post implantation. Mapping of
      the motor evoked responses in response to spatial and amplitude/frequency responses will be
      conducted and the specific configurations and parameters optimal for voluntary movement,
      standing and cardiovascular function will be identified. The individual will then undergo ES
      stimulation optimizing cardiovascular function for 60 consecutive days for 2 hours per day.

      The same clinical and neurophysiological assessments again will be repeated. The research
      participant will then undergo ES for voluntary movement sessions for 60 consecutive days for
      2 hours per day. Both the cardiovascular sessions and voluntary movement sessions can be
      conducted at home. The remote device records the minutes of stimulation and parameters used
      so these will be collected on those days the research participants are not in the
      laboratory. For the first 5 sessions of each intervention, the sessions will be conducted in
      the laboratory under the supervision of the investigators. The optimal parameters will be
      identified and programmed into the remote device. For the next 35 sessions, the research
      participants will come to the laboratory for every fifth session and cardiovascular
      parameters will be collected and voluntary movement assessed. After 20 sessions, EMG will be
      conducted during attempted voluntary movements. The final 5 sessions will also be conducted
      in the laboratory.

      The research participant will then complete the same clinical and neurophysiological
      assessments. The final intervention will include daily stand training sessions with ES
      stimulation parameters optimized for standing for one hour and 1 additional hour of
      cardiovascular and voluntary parameters for 60 sessions. All stand training and ES sessions
      will be conducted in the laboratory. Every 10 sessions the cardiovascular and voluntary
      sessions will also be conducted in the laboratory. Then the final clinical and
      neurophysiological assessments will be conducted.

      Cardiovascular Function:

      Orthostatic Stress Test will be assessed in the morning in a quiet, temperature-controlled
      (~22o C) room. After arriving, participants will be asked to empty their bladder before
      beginning the study. A butterfly catheter will be inserted into an antecubital vein during
      instrumentation to allow the collection of blood without additional stress to the
      participant by appropriate clinical staff. Continuous arterial BP will be acquired from a
      finger cuff placed around the left middle or index finger or thumb (Portapres-2; Finapres
      Medical Systems). The left hand will be placed in an arm sling and kept at the level of the
      heart throughout the study. Manual arterial blood pressure measurements will be taken at the
      beginning of the supine control period and at the end of the recovery period with a digital
      blood pressure measurement device. A three-lead ECG (ML132, AD Instruments) will be placed
      for ECG monitoring. Rib cage and abdomen kinematics (respiratory kinematics) will be
      acquired using an inductive plethysmograph (Inductotrace, Ambulatory Monitoring). Baseline
      recording for 15 minutes will begin after a 5-minute rest period that will follow subject
      preparation. At the end of 15-minute recording in the supine position, participants will be
      passively moved into the upright seated position. This position will be maintained for 15
      minutes. Then the participants will be passively moved to the supine position for 10
      minutes. Eight milliliters of venous blood will be drawn from an antecubital vein at the end
      of 15-minute supine to assess baseline catecholamine levels. Blood draw will be repeated at
      3 and at the end of 15 minutes of upright position. The test will be aborted if subjects
      become lightheaded or symptomatic of syncope. The Hemodynamic Test during standing; sitting
      and supine positions with and without ES will be recorded using a Portapres-2 system as
      described above.

      Blood pressure lability: 24-hour blood pressure monitoring Continuous blood pressure
      monitoring will be recorded over a period of 24 hours outside the lab (Meditech ABPM-04,
      Budapest, Hungary). In regards to the severity of AD, the participant's signs of OH (e.g.
      yawning, pallor) and subjective symptoms (e.g. light-headedness, dizziness) will also be
      assessed using validated autonomic questionnaires.

      Arterial Stiffness aPWV (m/s) is calculated by dividing the distance between measurement
      sites, by the pulse transit time. Distance between the carotid and femoral arteries will be
      measured using measuring tape along the surface of the body, held parallel to the testing
      table. The pulse transit is determined from the arterial blood pressure waves, which are
      collected at each arterial site. A pen-like device (model SPT-301; Millar Instruments Inc.,
      Houston, TX) will be applied to the carotid and femoral arterial sites using a light
      pressure to obtain arterial pressure waves. Heart rate will be recorded using a single-lead
      (lead I) electrocardiogram (ECG) (model ML 123, ADInstruments Inc., Colorado Springs, CO).

      Arterial structure: Wall thickness and lumen diameter

      Brachial and femoral arterial images will be collected using B-mode ultrasound (INFO) for 10
      cardiac cycles. Images will be analyzed using internal ultrasound software to determine
      lumen diameter and intima-media thickness

      Cardiac structure and function Cardiac images will be collected non-invasively using Doppler
      ultrasound (Vivid q, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Briefly, apical four and
      two-chamber views, and parasternal short and long-axis views will be collected and stored on
      the ultrasound for offline analysis. Indices of interest will include volumes (end systolic
      (ESV), end diastolic (EDV)), diameters (intraventricular septum systole (IVSs) and diastole
      (IVSd), left ventricular internal diameter systole (LVIDs)), systolic function (left
      ventricular posterior wall systole (LVIDd) and diastole (LVPWd), ejection fraction (EF),
      cardiac output (CO), fractional shortening, mitral regurgitation (dP/dT)) and diastolic
      function (E/A, E/e' ratio, IVRT, DT).

      International Autonomic Standards Evaluation Until recently individuals with SCI were only
      examined with use of motor and sensory neurological standards in order to establish the
      level and the severity of the neurological impartment or AIS (American Spinal Injury
      Association Impairment Scale) resulting from the SCI63. During the last decade,
      International Autonomic standards for evaluation of individuals with SCI were developed and
      implemented around the world64. These short standardized forms collect data on
      cardiovascular (AD and OH) as well as other autonomic dysfunctions including bladder bowel
      and sexual dysfunctions.

      Body Composition Weight, height, and total body fat will be determined from a dual energy
      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (Hologic QDR 4500W, APEX System Software Version 2.3) at the
      Vancouver General Hospital, performed in the supine position. Waist circumference will be
      measured in the supine position following a normal expiration, to the nearest 1cm midway
      between the lowest lateral border of the ribs and the uppermost lateral iliac crest. Waist
      circumference is considered the most practical bedside measurement of visceral adipose
      tissue. Hip circumference will be measured supine over the widest part of the femoral great
      trochanter. Waist/hip ratio and body mass index (measured weight in kilograms divided by the
      measured height [meters2]) will be calculated.

      Total body fat will be reported as total body fat in kilograms, and as a percent of total
      body weight determined by DXA scan. Height (length) will be measured using the electronic
      ruler function and weight from the DXA scan table scale feature. This is the preferred
      measure for assessing total body fat and has strong agreement with cadaver and chemical
      composition studies. Recent studies comparing DXA to CT and MRI have confirmed the validity
      and reliability of DXA to assess abdominal adiposity. In addition, its ease of use makes it
      ideal for studying large populations. All scans will be performed with a (Hologic Discovery
      QDR 4500W (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA), which has an error of less than 1% for body fat
      scans. An experienced technician will conduct scans according established protocol. All
      participants will be scanned with this methodology to ensure high internal validity.

      Metabolic Parameters

      Certified clinical Laboratories at each site will analyze all blood samples. Blood work at
      our site will be done at the Autonomic Research Laboratory at ICORD. A trained technician
      will draw a venous blood sample. Participants will undergo a 12-hour fast the night before,
      including no food or drink including alcohol or caffeine (water is permitted). A complete
      blood count (white blood cells and differentials, erythrocytes, packed cell volume,
      hematocrit, platelets, hemoglobin and red cell indices) will be performed.

      Blood glucose control (HbA1c), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, atherogenic dyslipidemia
      (triglycerides, TC, LDL-c, HDL-c, TC/HDL-c), a pro-thrombotic state (PAI-1 and TAFI), and a
      pro-inflammatory state (IL-6, and TNF-α) will also be measured. Blood samples for PAI-1,
      TAFI, IL-6, and TNF-α will be analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

      Plasma levels of lipid and hemoglobin A1c will be analyzed through laboratory services using
      a Dade Behring RxL Max analyzer. This system has demonstrated very good intra and interassay
      reliability for lipid and glucose measures75.

      Aerobic Fitness Evaluation:

      Peak oxygen uptake test (VO2peak) Participants will perform an exercise regiment. Resting
      ECG, blood pressure (DinamapCarescape V100; GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and
      respiratory measures (ParvomedicsTruemax 2400, Sandy, UT, USA) will be collected two minutes
      prior to exercise. Heart rate will also be monitored with a chest strap heart rate monitor
      (Polar T31 heart rate monitor, Polar Electro Inc., Woodbury, NY, USA). For participants with
      tetraplegia who have limited handgrip function, tensor bandages will be used to secure hands
      to the ergometer handles. Participants will be instructed to maintain a cycling rate of 60
      rev/min for the duration of the test. After an initial warm-up at 0W, power output will be
      increased at a rate of 5 W/min for participants with tetraplegia, or 10 W/min for
      participants with paraplegia, until volitional exhaustion (i.e. dropping below 30 rev/min).
      Participants will be asked to identify their ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) on the Borg
      scale76 every minute until the completion of exercise. Heart rate and oxygen consumption
      will be recorded on a breath-by-breathe basis for the duration of the test. The highest
      15-second average of oxygen consumption during the test will be recorded as VO2peak.

      Pulmonary Function Test, PFT

      PFT's will be performed in the participant's wheelchair using BreezeSuite System
      (MedGraphics, St. Paul, MN). Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1
      second (FEV1) will be obtained. Three acceptable spirograms will be obtained and the result
      of their best attempt will be used. MP45-36-871-350 Differential Pressure Transducer
      (Validyne Engineering, Northridge, CA) will be used to measure the maximum inspiratory
      pressure (PImax) and the maximum expiratory pressure (PEmax). The PImax will be measured
      during maximal inspiratory effort beginning at near residual volume and PEmax will be
      measured during maximal expiratory effort starting from near total lung capacity. The
      assessment will require a sharp, forceful effort be maintained for a minimum of 2 seconds.
      The maximum pressure will be taken as the highest value that can be sustained for one
      second. The maximum value from three maneuvers that varied by less than 20% will be
      averaged.

      Respiratory Surface Electromyography:

      EMG measure of motor output will be recorded during voluntary respiratory motor tasks
      attempted in the sitting and supine position. The protocol will consist of 5 minutes of
      quiet breathing followed by Maximum Inspiratory Pressure Task (MIPT), Maximum Expiratory
      Pressure Task (MEPT), and cough. During MIPT/MEPT, subjects will be asked to produce maximum
      inspiratory or expiratory efforts for 5 seconds. Each maneuver will be cued by an audible
      tone and repeated three times using a Motion Lab EMG System with pairs of pre-amplified
      electrodes (Motion Lab Systems, Baton Rouge, LA) centered over the muscle belly. Bilateral
      recorded muscles include: clavicular portion of pectoralis (PEC); 6th intercostals (IC6);
      rectus abdominus (RA); obliquus abdominus(OBL); paraspinal (PSP). The incoming sEMG signals
      will be filtered at 30-1000 Hz and sampled at 2000 Hz.

      EMG, kinematics and kinetics experiments:

      During the experiments, the research participants will be placed on the treadmill in an
      upright position and suspended by a cable in a harness (i.e. BWST) or on an overground
      standing device. Voluntary leg movements will be performed on a mat. Following standard skin
      preparation techniques, bipolar surface EMG electrodes will be placed bilaterally on the
      soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemious (MG), tibialis anterior (TA), medial hamstrings (MH),
      quadriceps (VL and RF) and adductor (AD) muscles. Fine-wire EMG electrodes will be used for
      deep muscles of the hip and foot. Limb kinematics including hip, knee and ankle angles will
      be acquired using high speed passive marker motion capture (Motion Analysis, Santa Rosa,
      CA). When appropriate we will measure individual ground reaction forces (GRF) using HRMat
      (TEKSCAN, Boston, MA) or forces during movement with a force transducer (Kistler, Amherst,
      NY).

      E MG and Soleus H-reflex (Specific Aim 4): All EMG data will be collected at 2000 Hz with
      custom-written acquisition software (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). We will record
      bilateral EMG (Motion Lab Systems, Baton Rouge, LA, USA) from same muscles as above. The
      soleus H-reflex will be evoked by monopolar electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial
      nerve at the popliteal fossa using a 1-ms pulse, generated by a constant current stimulator
      (DS7A, Digitimer, UK) and will be recorded by surface monopolar differential electrodes
      placed over the soleus muscle. A minimum 10 control and conditioned reflexes will be
      recorded in every trial. The indifferent electrode will be placed above the patella for
      selective stimulation of the nerve trunk. The EMG signal will be amplified and band-pass
      filtered (10 Hz-500 Hz) before being sampled at 2 kHz (1401 plus running Spike 2 software).
      The digitized EMG signals will be rectified and the size of M-wave and H-reflex responses
      will be measured as the area under the full-rectified waveforms. Soleus H-reflexes will be
      recorded as designated by each specific supraspinal pathway protocol (described in detail
      below). For all conditioning experiments, amplitude and latency changes of the soleus
      H-reflex will be used to quantify the effects of the TMS, galvanic, auditory or ulnar nerve
      stimulation. Control H-reflexes will be evoked interleaved with those conditioned by the
      respective stimulation.

      Corticospinal pathways We will administer single pulse transmagnetic stimulation using a
      Magstim 200 single-pulse stimulator with a double cone coil for activating lower extremity
      musculature while the research participants are in the supine position. We will position the
      coil approximately 0-2 cm anterior to the vertex to locate the hotspot left and right
      tibialis anterior and quadriceps muscles. We will position the coils tangentially to the
      scalp with intersection of both wings at 45 degrees to midline for optimal motor cortex
      stimulation. We will use Signal software (Cambridge electronic design, UK) to trigger motor
      evoked potential (MEP) data acquisition. We will perform MEP data analysis using Signal
      software (Cambridge electronic design, UK). Mean peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes (average of
      8-10 trials) at intensities 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% and 70% above rMT will be used to
      generate stimulus response curves. Using SigmaPlot curve-fitting software, stimulus response
      curves will be fitted with the Boltzmann function: MEPa= P/1+exp ((I50-I)/k), where P is the
      Plateau amplitude, I is the intensity, I50 is the amplitude at 50% of plateau and k is slope
      parameter of the steepest portion of the curve.

      Research participants will be in a supine position with a fixed hip, knee and joint angle.
      For those individuals who can maintain a voluntary contraction, an additional series of
      tests will be conducted with background EMG activity. For soleus H-reflex modulation single
      pulses will be used to condition the H-reflex induced by posterior tibial nerve stimulation
      at interstimulus intervals ranging between 0 and 100 s. We will measure the MEP's in
      response to incrementing levels of TMS over the leg area of the primary motor cortex and
      generate recruitment curves. We will measure changes in threshold, slope and the maximum
      amplitude of the recruitment curve to determine if severity of injury, time since injury, or
      locomotor training influences the excitability or functional connectivity of the
      corticospinal pathways. We will also compare the reproducibility of these parameters in
      non-disabled research participants to verify these changes are not attributed to inherent
      variability of the measurements. We will calculate peak-to-peak values for the MEP response
      and those responses at a given stimulation frequency will be averaged and plotted versus the
      stimulation intensity. If background EMG is elicited we will average the amplitude from a 25
      ms window prior to stimulation.

      Vestibulospinal pathways:

      We will administer galvanic stimulation (rectangular pulses, 300 ms, 2-4.5 mA) with
      Digitimer DS5 Isolated Bipolar Constant Current Stimulator using 2.5 cm diameter electrodes
      placed over the mastoid processes for the assessment of the vestibulospinal pathways. The
      digitimer will be externally triggered by our Labview program and used to condition the
      soleus H-Reflex. The research participants will be lying with the head of the mat fixed (30
      degrees) because posture influences the responses. Control H-reflexes will be evoked
      interleaved with those conditioned by auditory stimulation with the time randomly between 10
      and 20 seconds to allow adequate recovery of the motoneuron pool. A minimum of 5 responses
      of control and condition will be measured and averaged with conditioned responses expressed
      as percentage of control values. Peak-to-peak amplitude will be calculated and the mean
      amplitude and standard deviation for each of the conditioned and control reflexes. The
      conditioned reflexes will be expressed as a percentage of the control reflexes.

      Reticulospinal pathway:

      The reticulospinal pathway will be evaluated using soleus H-reflex amplitude under
      conditioning stimulation via auditory stimulus (30 ms tone of 90 dB at 700 Hz) that will be
      delivered using binaural earphones. EMG will be recorded from the sternocleidomastoid muscle
      to confirm the startle response. The soleus H-reflex will be elicited 50 ms after the sound
      to peak after 75-125 ms and return to baseline values after 250 ms. Amplitude changes of the
      soleus H-reflex will be used to quantify the effects of the auditory stimulation. Control
      H-reflexes will be evoked interleaved with those conditioned by auditory stimulation with a
      time separation of at least 2 minutes. A minimum of 5 responses of control and condition
      will be measured peak-to-peak and averaged with conditioned responses expressed as
      percentage of control values.

      Long propriospinal pathway:

      The long propriospinal system will be evaluated using soleus H-reflex amplitude under
      conditioning stimulation of the ipsilateral ulnaris nerve at the wrist joint via surface
      electrodes with trains of 3 rectangular pulses (pulse duration: 0.5 ms, pulse interval: 3
      ms). The soleus H-reflex will be elicited 100 ms after the ulnaris nerve stimulation. The
      intensities of the stimuli will be expressed as multiples of the threshold for the direct M
      response of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The stimulus will be applied every 3 s in a
      randomized, interleaved conditioned and unconditioned stimuli sequences.

      Interventions:

        1. ES Cardiovascular Parameters during sitting or lying supine;

        2. ES Voluntary Parameters during voluntary leg movement training and

        3. ES during stand training and ES Voluntary Parameters during voluntary leg movement
           training.
