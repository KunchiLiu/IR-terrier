    <textblock>
      This phase II trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of obinutuzumab and bendamustine
      treatment in participants with refractory or relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
      Participants receive up to six 28-day cycles of treatment. Treatment consists of intravenous
      (IV) administration of obinutuzumab and bendamustine. Treatment time is expected to last 6
      months, and participant follow-up will last 2 years.
