      This Post Approval Study is a longitudinal, multi-center trial. Up to 1,200 subjects will be
      enrolled in investigational centers across the United States. Subjects will attend 6 study
      visits over a period of one year.

      The study objective is to demonstrate that home use of Threshold Suspend (TS) is not
      associated with glycemic deterioration, as measured by change in A1C.
