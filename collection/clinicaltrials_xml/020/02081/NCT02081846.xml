      Home Nurse Visit post discharge.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To identify barriers to successful transitions that are most meaningful to patients and
      families, and use these identified barriers to iteratively adapt an existing nurse home
      visit program to address these barriers. This study will also test the efficacy of a nurse
      home visit intervention in improving post-discharge outcomes.

    <measure>Reutilization</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who receive the nurse home visit intervention will have a significantly lower occurrence of any all cause rehospitalization, ED/urgent care revisit, and/or unscheduled follow-up within 30-days post-discharge when compared to the patients enrolled in the control group after 30 days post-discharge. The dependent variable will be a dichotomized indicator of any occurrence of rehospitalization, ED revisit, and/or unscheduled follow-up within 30-days post-discharge. Differences in this outcome between intervention and control groups will be evaluated using logistic regression with the stratification variable (presence or absence of underlying chronic condition and hospitalist medicine general vs. surgical service) included in the model to account for the sampling design.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Identified Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of secondary outcomes identified through Aim 1 will be tailored to the outcome measure. For example, if parents or caregivers identify days of work missed as an important outcome, our analysis of days of work missed will be restricted to only those parents/caregivers reporting work outside the home. We will take a two-part approach to analysis. First, we will treat it as a binary outcome, comparing the percentage of caregivers that missed at least one day of work during the 30-day follow-up period between the two study arms using logistic regression. Second, we will treat the number of days of work missed as a count outcome and use poisson regression to compare the two study arms. No interim analysis is planned.</description>

    <description>We will complete a single center, parallel, randomized, standard-of-care-controlled prospective study to determine the efficacy of a nurse home visit program, an intervention adapted from those studied in other populations (i.e., adults, high-risk infants) and re-engineered through Aim 2, in improving pediatric patient transitions from hospital to home</description>

    <description>Control patients will be randomized to receive standard-of-care at discharge. This care at our institution includes pediatric hospitalist to PCP verbal and written communication prior to discharge, written documentation for the family regarding prescribed medication regimen, recommended follow-up with outpatient PCP and relevant consultant(s), and delivery of prescribed medications from the hospital pharmacy to the patient's bedside.</description>
