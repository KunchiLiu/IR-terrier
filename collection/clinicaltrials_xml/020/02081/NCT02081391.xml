  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of tapentadol oral solution, based on
      the total amount of supplemental opioid analgesic used over 12 hours or 24 hours after
      initiation of investigational medicinal product in children and adolescents who have
      undergone surgery that would produce moderate to severe pain during opioid treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), multi-site, double-blind
      (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives),
      placebo-controlled (placebo is compared with the study medication to test whether the study
      medication has a real effect in clinical study), parallel group (each group of participants
      will be treated at the same time), and multiple oral dose study.

      This study will consist of an enrollment phase (up to 28 days), a treatment and evaluation
      phase (4 days), and a follow-up phase (10 to 14 days after the first dose of IMP). A dose
      regimen of 1.25 mg/kg will be used for the first 24 hours of treatment in this study in
      children aged 6 months to less than 18 years old. After 24 hours after the start of study
      medication, and based on clinical judgment, the dose may either be continued at 1.25 mg/kg
      or it may be decreased to 1.0 mg/kg. A decision to maintain or alter the dose will depend on
      the effectiveness of the analgesia (pain killer) and the adverse event profile observed in
      each child over the first 24 hour dosing period. The doses for participants aged less than 6
      months old will be defined based on the forthcoming pharmacokinetic (what the body does to a
      medication) data. The supplemental opioid medication reflecting the standard of care will be
      available as patient or nurse controlled intravenous morphine or hydromorphone. This
      supplemental opioid medication will be given to control pain, as needed, in both the
      treatment and placebo groups.

      In exceptional cases, if a participant has unbearable pain despite using NCA/PCA, an
      additional bolus (defined as a clinician bolus) of morphine or hydromorphone may be
      administered. The clinician bolus can be given either using the NCA/PCA pump system or by an
      intravenous bolus injection. The opioid given as a clinician bolus or if the NCA/PCA
      intravenous line fails must be the same as that used in the NCA/PCA pump system.

      Dosing with Investigational Medicinal Product will be stopped if:

        -  A switch to exclusively oral opioid analgesic medication is indicated according to the
           local standard of care.

        -  Opioid analgesic medication is no longer needed.

        -  Investigational Medicinal Product has been administered for 72 hours.

      Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, laboratory
      parameters, electrocardiogram, and specific scale to assess suicidal ideation. The maximum
      study duration for each participant will be 42 days.
