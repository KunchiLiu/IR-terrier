      This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of quetiapine as treatment for
      pediatric delirium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many children in the ICU become confused, due to their underlying illness or treatment
      effects. The medical term for this confusion is delirium. In adults, a medication called
      quetiapine has been effective in treating delirium. This is considered an &quot;off label&quot; use as
      the FDA has not approved quetiapine for this indication.

      Pediatricians have been using quetiapine to treat delirium in children as well, but there is
      currently no data proving that it is effective in children. This study is being done to
      determine if quetiapine is effective for the treatment of ICU delirium in children.
