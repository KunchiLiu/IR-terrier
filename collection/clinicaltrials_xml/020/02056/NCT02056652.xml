    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) is associated with over one million infant deaths annually worldwide.
      The incidence of PTB in the United States is 11.5% with more than 500,000 deliveries
      occurring at less than 37 weeks gestation annually. The rate of PTB in the United States
      increased to 12.8% in 2006, and remains high compared to almost all other developed
      countries, despite the introduction of many public health and medical interventions designed
      to delay PTB. Weekly treatment with 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate beginning at 16-20
      weeks gestation has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of PTB and is currently
      recommended for women who experienced spontaneous PTB in a prior pregnancy. However, a
      strategy for the prevention of spontaneous PTBs in which therapeutic intervention is
      restricted to women with a previous PTB is likely to have a small effect on the overall rate
      of prematurity since only about 10% of spontaneous PTBs arise in women with such a history.
      A major reduction in rates of mortality and morbidity in premature babies will only be
      achieved with increased precision in the identification of women at risk of spontaneous PTB
      and through the development of an effective prevention for this complication. Transvaginal
      ultrasound measurement of cervical length is a reliable screening test for prediction of
      PTB. Although treatment with vaginal progesterone is effective in decreasing PTB in women
      with a short cervix, over 30% of women still experience premature delivery and many women
      find daily administration of progesterone to be challenging. Preliminary studies have
      suggested that use of an intravaginal pessary may be effective in preventing PTB. If
      effective this approach would be particularly appealing because of the wide availability of
      pessaries, ease of use, and low cost. Unfortunately, existing studies are inadequate to
      confirm effectiveness; a well designed, properly powered, prospective randomized trial is
      warranted prior to widespread implementation in clinical practice. We propose such a trial
      to study the effectiveness of the pessary in decreasing the incidence of PTB in an inner
      city Philadelphia population.
