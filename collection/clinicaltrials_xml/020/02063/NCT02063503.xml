      There is a consensus that exercise therapy should be used as a therapy approach in CLBP but
      little consensus has been reached about the preferential type of therapy. There occurs to be
      a wash out effect because of the heterogeneous character of CLBP patients. Therefore there
      is a need for the development of CPR's. Objectives for this trial are first, the derivation
      of clinical prediction rules (CPR) to predict treatment response to three forms of exercise
      therapy for patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain (CLBP). Secondly, to validate a
      clinical prediction rule for the three forms of exercise therapy for patients with
      nonspecific CLBP.

      The study design is a Randomized controlled trial. Patients with non-specific low back pain
      of more than three months duration are recruited at the Antwerp University Hospital. After
      examination patients are randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: motor
      control therapy, general active exercise therapy and isometric training therapy. All
      patients will undergo eighteen treatment sessions during nine weeks. Measurements will be
      taken at baseline, nine weeks, six months and at one year. The primary outcome used is the
      Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire. For each type of exercise therapy a clinical
      prediction rule will be derived and validated. For validation the CPR will be applied to
      divide each treatment group into two subgroups (matched and unmatched therapy) using the
      baseline measurements. We predict a better therapy effect for matched therapy.

      Never before a RCT design was performed for the development of a CPR for exercise therapy in
      CLBP patients. Only one CPR was described in a single arm design for motor control therapy
      in sub-acute non-radicular LBP patients. In this study, a sufficiently large sample will be
      included in both the derivation and validation phase.

      Methods/ Design

      Ethical approval (B300201215600) was obtained from the local ethics committees of the
      University of Antwerp and the Antwerp University Hospital.

      Study design

      The development of a CPR consists of three consecutive phases. The first two are the
      derivation and validation phase.

      In the derivation phase a CPR is derived from a number of variables that have predictive
      potential for therapy outcome. These variables are obtained from baseline measurements and
      have a multidimensional character (impairments, activities/participation and contextual
      factors). Data analysis is being used to calculate the most powerful combination of these
      variables to finally form the new derived CPR In the validation phase the derived clinical
      prediction rule will be applied in a new study population. This application will result in
      matched patients (allocated in accordance with the CPR) and in unmatched patients (not in
      accordance with the CPR). The treatment success of both groups will be compared. The
      hypothesis is that treatment success will be higher in the matched group.

      For both phases, a single blinded RCT study design will be used. The project started in
      August 2014. Analysis of these data is planned end 2015.

      Patient recruitment

      Patients will be recruited by doctors at the service of two settings located in Antwerp at
      the Antwerp University Hospital (UZA). Treatment and measurements will be performed at the
      site where the patient has been recruited.

      Inclusion criteria: Current nonspecific LBP persisting at least three months, consulted a
      medical doctor during the last month because of the persistent low back pain, age between 18
      and 60, sufficient fluency in Dutch to follow treatment instructions and answer survey
      questions.

      Exclusion criteria: spinal canal stenosis, spondylolisthesis and spondylitis, large
      herniated disc sciatica, radiating pain below the knee, previous back surgery, a history of
      known spinal fractures, malignancy, known muscle-, nerve-, skin-, or joint diseases,
      pregnancy and lack of consent.

      These in-and exclusion criteria will be applied in both the derivation and validation phase.

      Measurements

      Baseline testing As primary (dependent) outcome measure the Modified Oswestry Disability
      Questionnaire is used. The MODI is a disease specific questionnaire to measure disability in
      LBP patients [21-23].

      As secondary (independent) outcome measures the following tests are used:

      First, Measurement of impairments: duration of the LBP/ pelvis impairments / respiratory
      impairments (all three items through anamnesis). Prone instability test, Straight Leg Raise,
      Beighton scale, Active Straight Leg Raise, sitting knee extension test, waiters bow, pelvic
      tilt, side support test, extensor endurance test, active sit-up, Visual Analogue Scale for
      pain (VAS).

      Second, measurement of limitations in activities and participation: hours of physical
      activity/week (trough anamnesis). Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF36), Roland Morris
      Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ).

      Third, measurement of contextual factors: gender/ age / height / weight / body mass index /
      smoking / profession / underwent previous therapy / comorbidity (trough anamnesis). Tampa
      scale for kinesiophobia, Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ), We performed a
      literature search to select all used clinical tests based on their reliability and validity
      [24]. Further, clinical tests used by Hicks et al were also included in our study design.
      The Baseline testing takes about 30 minutes.

      Follow-up

      Short-term follow up: takes place after completion of the treatment program at nine weeks.
      All primary and secondary outcome measures from the baseline testing will be reevaluated at
      this moment.

      Long-term follow-up: at six months and one year after entering the study the following
      outcome measurements will be inventoried: age, weight, hours physical activity/week,
      profession, duration low back pain, MODI, Tampa scale for kinesiophobia, VAS. The patients
      will be contacted by mail initially and by phone if they do not respond to the mail within
      two weeks to make an appointment.

      Randomization &amp; blinding

      In both phases patients will be randomly assigned into one of the three treatment groups
      after baseline testing. The responsible researcher will use a randomization list generated
      with Microsoft ® Excel ® software (version 14.3.9, 2010 © Microsoft Corporation).

      Intervention

      During the nine weeks intervention, patients will be treated two times a week. Patients will
      be assigned randomly into one of three intervention groups (motor control therapy, general
      active exercise therapy and isometric training therapy). Each intervention will take about
      seventy minutes. Ten minutes warming up and cooling down will be the same in each treatment
      regime. Each group receives fifty minutes of therapy specific intervention. Previously
      trained physiotherapists will give the treatment. To ensure that all therapists provide the
      same exercises, a treatment protocol for each treatment group was developed and a treatment
      diary will be filled out after each session.

      Interventions in derivation and validation phase are similar.

      Power analysis

      After the derivation phase new patients have to be included to execute the validation phase.

      Derivation phase Because we can't predict therapy effect in the derivation phase, we use a
      two-tailed hypothesis to calculate the power. A pilot study showed that the standard
      deviation of our primary outcome measure, the MODI, is comparable to the results of Brennan
      et al. [17]. Given these estimates, 120 patients are needed to detect a minimum clinically
      important difference (effect size 0.43) with 80% power using a two-tailed hypothesis. This
      means that 3 X 40 patients need to complete the whole trial. Since Van der Wouden et al.
      [34] mention a dropout rate of 54%, we aim to include 260 patients.

      Validation phase In the validation phase the intervention therapy stays the same but new
      patients will be included. In this study design, the interest is that treatment success will
      be higher in the matched group than the unmatched group which means a one-tailed hypothesis
      is used to calculate the power. In the validation phase we need 105 patients to detect a
      minimum clinically important difference (effect size 0.43) with 80% power using a one-tailed
      hypothesis. This means that 3 X 35 patients need to complete the whole trial. Again we take
      a dropout rate of 54% into account and aim to include 229 patients.

      Data analysis

      Derivation phase This phase aims to detect potential predictive variables for treatment
      success (dichotomous, yes/no) in a set of baseline measurements. A minimal decrease in the
      MODI score of 6 points is considered as treatment success [35].

      Potential predictive variables are selected as follows: first, individual variables from the
      self-reports, history, and physical examination are tested for their bivariate association
      with the reference standard using independent sample t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests or
      Chi-square tests based on the nature of the data. Variables with a significance level of P &lt;
      0.10 are retained as potential prediction variables. We choose a more liberal significance
      level at this stage to avoid excluding potential predictive variables.

      Next, selected potential prediction variables and known predictors as determined in the
      study of Hicks et al. [16] are entered into a multiple linear regression equation to
      determine the optimal set of predictors. A significance of P &lt; 0.05 is used in this stage.
      Variables retained in the regression model are used to develop a multiple clinical
      prediction rule for classifying patients as likely responders to treatment. This statistical
      analysis is performed for each treatment group (motor control therapy, general active
      exercise therapy and isometric training therapy).

      Validation phase In the validation phase new patients will be again assigned randomly into
      one of the three treatment groups. Based on the derived CPR determined in phase 1 each
      intervention group will be divided into either &quot;matched therapy&quot; or &quot;unmatched therapy&quot;. The
      recruitment, information form, informed consent, measurements, blinding and intervention
      procedure will be the same for both derivation and validation phase.

      To verify intergroup differences at baseline, variables will be compared between groups
      using independent t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, or Chi-square tests of independence of
      independence based on the nature of the data.

      To examine the principle hypothesis (difference in treatment effect between matched and
      unmatched groups), a three-way repeated- measures analysis of variance will be performed
      with treatment group (motor control vs. general active exercise therapy vs. isometric
      therapy) and classification subgroup (motor control vs. general active exercise therapy vs.
      isometric therapy) as between-subject variables and time (baseline, 9 weeks, 6 months and 1
      year) as the within-subject variable. The dependent variable is disability (MODI score). The
      hypothesis of interest is the three-way interaction, and the two-way interactions between
      time and treatment group, and between time and classification subgroup. We hypothesize that
      outcome over time will not differ based on the randomized treatment group, or the
      classification subgroup, but will depend on the interaction between the treatment group and
      classification subgroup, such that patients randomized to 'matched treatment' will have
      better outcomes than patients randomized to 'unmatched treatment'. This hypothesis will be
      supported if the three-way interaction is significant, but the two-way interactions are not.
      Pairwise post hoc comparisons will be performed at each follow-up period to further explore
      any significant interaction terms.

      In both derivation and validation phase we will use an intention-to-treat analysis.

      Information form and informed consent

      If patients meet the in- and exclusion criteria they are scheduled for an interview with one
      of our researchers to be informed about the trial. If patients decide to participate they
      will sign an informed consent. Information form and informed consent are made and have been
      approved by the ethics committee of the UA and the Antwerp University hospital .
