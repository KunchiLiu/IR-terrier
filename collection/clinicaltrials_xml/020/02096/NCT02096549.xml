    <textblock>
      During Intramuscular botulinum toxin injections for children with cerebral palsy, immobility
      is essential to inject botulinum toxin to the right muscle. Because children with cerebral
      palsy are generally unable to control their movement, deep sedation is required during this
      painful procedure.

      Short-acting drugs such as propofol and remifentanil are widely used for pediatric
      anesthesia and sedation but still have possibility of over-sedation and associated
      complications due to their rather narrow therapeutic window. Therefore, objective scoring
      system to assess the level of sedation to provide an effective and safe sedation in
      children. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring,an objective guidance of sedation might be
      helpful.

      The present study is to investigate the validity of the BIS monitoring during deep sedation
      of children with cerebral palsy for injection of botulinum toxin.

    <textblock>
      Intramuscular botulinum toxin injections for children with cerebral palsy have been
      extensively performed to relive spasticity and improve rehabilitation. During procedure
      immobility is essential to inject botulinum toxin to the right muscle for optimal effect.
      Because children with cerebral palsy are generally unable to control their movement, deep
      sedation is required during this painful procedure.

      Short-acting drugs with rapid, predictable onset and offset of action, such as propofol and
      remifentanil, facilitate infusion rate adjustments and rapid recovery. However, there is
      always the possibility of over-sedation, hypotension and respiratory depression due to their
      rather narrow therapeutic window.

      Several clinical sedation scales have been used to provide an effective and safe sedation in
      children. Because clinical scoring depends on patient response to verbal or physical
      stimulation, it is difficult to assess the level of sedatin in patients with deep sedation
      during delicate phase of the procedure. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring,an objective
      guidance of sedation might be helpful. Although BIS scores in children with conscious and
      deep sedation were reported to correlate with clinical sedation scales, the validity during
      painful procedure in children with cerebral palsy was not investigated yet.

      The present study is to investigate the validity of the BIS monitoring and its correlation
      to University of Michigan sedation scale during deep sedation of children with cerebral
      palsy for injection of botulinum toxin.
