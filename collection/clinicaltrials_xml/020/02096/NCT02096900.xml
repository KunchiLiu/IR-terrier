  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to compare the efficacy of oral
      midazolam and zolpidem for preoperative sedation, anxiety of patient, and caregiver anxiety
      at the time of separation, and ease of mask acceptance at induction in children. Subjects
      will be randomized to receive oral medication midazolam or zolpidem approximately 30 minutes
      prior to surgery. No placebo will be administered in this study. Subjects will be male and
      female children between 2 and 9 years of age. In total, subject participation will last
      approximately the duration of their preoperative, perioperative, and immediate postoperative
      period. A member of the research team will recruit subjects preoperatively in the operating
      room holding area prior to surgery. Consent will take place at the time of recruitment in
      the preoperative holding area following a detailed explanation of the study and medications
      involved in the study. Participants will be of ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists)
      class I-II, undergoing surgical procedures of at least 2 hours duration, and expected to
      remain inpatient for at least 23 hours postoperatively.

    <measure>Patient anxiety at the time of separation</measure>
    <time_frame>Study participation will be about 1 day including the preoperative, perioperative at the time of induction, and postoperative period</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure of patient anxiety will be measured using the validated Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Score (mYPAS). The mYPAS is the current standard for evaluation of anxiety in children receiving anesthesia for surgical procedures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Other comparison measures will include preoperative parent/caregiver anxiety, anesthesia mask acceptance characteristics at the time of induction, and time to full recovery in the post operative period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Secondary outcome measures will begin when the parent/caregiver completes the STAI questionnaire prior to the study medication being given to the subject.</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures:
Parental/caregiver anxiety, will be assessed using the validated State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI), a well published self-evaluation questionnaire. (6) The baseline STAI will be completed by the parent/caregiver immediately upon obtaining informed consent in the preoperative holding area and then again immediately after caregiver/patient separation.
Mask acceptance by the patient, will be measured on a 4-point scale adapted from a similar trial. (2)
Presence or absence of emergence agitation during recovery, will be assessed using the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium scale recorded at 5-minute intervals for 20 minutes following the child's spontaneous eye opening. (7)
Sleep / sleep disturbances will be extracted from nursing notes and recorded on the case report form.
Patient and procedure characteristics will be extracted from the record and recorded on the case report form.</description>
