          -  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure parameters above 140 and 90, respectively.

          -  Resting heart rate outside of 60-100 bpm.

          -  Abnormal ECG parameters defined as QTC&gt; 460msec, QRS&gt;120 msec, and/or PR&gt;200 msec.

          -  ECG evidence of ischemia or arrhythmia as reviewed by an independent cardiologist.

          -  Participant with a history of non-response to adequate trial of methylphenidate
             (therapeutic dose for an adequate duration) as determined by clinician.

          -  History of intolerance or an allergic reaction to methylphenidate.

          -  Current or recent treatment (within the past 30 days) with current stimulant class of

          -  Current treatment with a first- or second-generation antipsychotic medication on a
             dose that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline visit.

          -  Current treatment with a psychotropic medication on a dose that has not been stable
             for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline visit.

          -  Investigator and his/her immediate family, defined as the investigator's spouse,
             parent, child, grandparent, or grandchild.

        While stably treated or remitted hypertension is not exclusionary, any subject with a
        history of high blood pressure will be asked to obtain approval from their primary care
        physician certifying that their hypertension is stable and that they may safely begin
        stimulant therapy. Subjects will be informed of the cardiovascular risks of MPH, and any
        subject with a history of hypertension who is unwilling to consult with their current
        treater—or to grant study staff permission to consult with the subject's current
        treater—will be excluded because of the potential risks to subject safety. Per the FDA
        approved MPH-ERLF package insert, high blood pressure is not a contraindication of MPH
        therapy; however, due to the cardiovascular side effects, it is recommended that subjects
        with a history of high blood pressure be monitored carefully. Cardiovascular risk factors
        are carefully monitored throughout the study for all subjects by way of screening
        electrocardiograms and pulse/blood pressure readings at every office visit. Patients with
        current untreated hypertension are not eligible.
