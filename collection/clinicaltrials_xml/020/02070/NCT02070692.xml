      The purpose of this study is to study whether a drug called tamoxifen can reduce vaginal
      bleeding in women who are using the Etonogestrel contraceptive implant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly all of the 3 million unintended pregnancies in the United States each year result
      from inconsistent or non-use of contraception. Increasing use of the most effective methods
      of contraception will reduce unintended pregnancies and their social, medical and economic
      consequences. The contraceptive etonogestrel implant (ENG implant) is 20 times more
      effective at pregnancy prevention than oral contraceptive pills, but it has bleeding side
      effects that make it unappealing for many women. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor
      modulator (SERM) used most commonly for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, has previously
      been shown to dramatically reduce bleeding in users of an older levonorgestrel-based
      contraceptive implant (Norplant tm). It has not been studied in newer progestin-based
      methods such as the ENG implant. If tamoxifen could stop bleeding in users of the ENG
      implant, it would give patients and physicians a valuable option for management of
      progestin-induced irregular bleeding. This research project will test the effectiveness of
      tamoxifen taken on an as-needed basis to treat abnormal bleeding in ENG implant users. If
      tamoxifen can be established as an effective treatment for frequent or prolonged bleeding,
      it will increase the acceptability of the ENG implant, increase its use and reduce
      unintended pregnancies. This is the first project to evaluate tamoxifen for treatment of
      unfavorable bleeding in users of the ENG contraceptive implant.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether tamoxifen taken by users of the ENG implant on an as-needed basis for frequent or prolonged bleeding can reduce the number of bleeding days by at least 40% over 180 days, when compared to placebo.</description>

    <description>Secondary objective is to determine whether tamoxifen can improve satisfaction with the implant and with bleeding patterns.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ovulation</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A third secondary objective is to determine whether taking tamoxifen at this dose compromises ovulation suppression in ENG users. Tamoxifen is known to transiently raise serum estradiol levels, but does not affect gonadotropin release in premenopausal women. Therefore, it is unlikely to interact with the ovulation suppression provided by the implant. However, to further investigate any theoretical interaction between tamoxifen and etonogestrel, urine markers of ovulation will be collected to document ongoing ovulation suppression with intermittent tamoxifen use.</description>
