      Open-label, dose-escalation study in subjects with previously treated B-cell malignancies to
      find maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or pharmacologic active dose of a PI3Kδ inhibitor,
      INCB050465, as monotherapy and in combination with: itacitinib (INCB039110), a JAK1
      inhibitor; rituximab; and rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. INCB050465
      inhibits PI3Kδ, a protein involved in growth and survival of B-cell cancer cells.
