    <textblock>
      This study involves research. Some chemotherapeutic drugs that can permanently reduce
      hearing are termed &quot;ototoxic&quot;. One such drug is the chemotherapy called cisplatin.
      Currently, if a patient is receiving cisplatin, hearing is tested in the Audiology Clinic
      using lengthy protocols and may be retested only when it is requested by their oncologist
      and when the Veteran can arrange an appointment. Researchers think that hearing testing
      prior to every treatment of cisplatin may reduce the number of Veterans who get disabling
      hearing loss from treatment. The purpose of this study is to compare the current method of
      monitoring hearing (audiology clinic protocols termed &quot;usual care&quot;) with a new portable
      hearing monitoring program (a comprehensive program of ototoxicity monitoring termed
      &quot;COMP-VA&quot;) that tests hearing using a portable hearing testing audiometer and a variety of
      efficient tools and techniques so that testing can occur prior to each cisplatin treatment
      at any quiet location in the hospital.

    <textblock>
      Research objectives are to compare the effectiveness of ototoxicity monitoring implemented
      using Comp-VA or usual care with regard to (1) improving Veterans' hearing and quality of
      life outcomes, (2) assisting oncologists in pre-treatment counseling and therapeutic
      planning and (3) increasing use of post-treatment rehabilitative services.

      The investigators plan to recruit a total of 320 Veterans undergoing cisplatin
      chemotherapeutic treatment over 4 years and 120 control subjects.

      Program Evaluation: Hearing testing prior to treatment will be done in order to establish
      eligibility, enroll and randomize each subject into one of two study arms. At 5 weeks and at
      one year post-randomization hearing will be re-tested in order to obtain an estimate of
      longitudinal trends in hearing and quality of life assessment. Use of audiological services
      following treatment from the randomized subjects will be tracked. Finally, data will also be
      collected at each treatment interval to track use of counseling tools and oncology personnel
      treatment decisions.

      Serial measurements from subjects receiving cisplatin prior to treatment who are randomized
      to:

      Comp-VA group will get a screening hearing test prior to treatment, at each treatment
      interval and at one-month post-treatment. Auditory testing will be done on or near the Chemo
      Unit and will include otoscopy, immittance testing, and a hearing testing done by the
      Veteran using a self-testing procedure, and may be tested using distortion product
      otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), if they cannot take a reliable hearing test.

      Usual care group will receive a full audiometric evaluation (otoscopy, immittance testing,
      air conduction and bone conduction hearing testing, speech audiometry, and distortion
      product otoacoustic emissions, DPOAEs) scheduled in the audiology clinic sound booth
      according to Audiology Service ototoxicity monitoring protocols. Testing will be arranged
      according to availability of appointments and patient convenience.

      Additionally data will also be collected from control subjects who are similar in age and
      are tested at intervals similar to the chemotherapy subjects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All Veterans entering cisplatin chemotherapy will be informed of the project and invited
        to participate unless the Veteran was excluded by CPRS review or medical advice.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Experimental subjects must be prescribed cisplatin for treatment of cancer to be
             enrolled in the treatment arms of this study.

        Criteria for excluding subjects (chemotherapy and controls subjects) from this study will
        be:

          -  cognitively or physically unable to participate (patient or nurse report patient is
             incapable of participating), CPRS indication that subject exhibits aggressive
             behavior, subject has documented dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or severe
             psychosocial disorder, CPRS notes indicate individual is not legally capable of
             providing informed consent (subject has a legal guardian)

          -  unable to provide reliable behavioral hearing test responses (for either program
             evaluation hearing test or baseline, pre -treatment hearing test) as indicated by
             intra-session behavioral threshold reliability criterion of &gt; +5 dB)

          -  exhibits Meniere's disease or retrocochlear disorder based on hearing test results,
             patient report or notes in CPRS

          -  exhibits active or recent history of middle ear disorder based on otoscopy,
             tympanometry, patient report, or notes in CPRS

          -  unwilling to participate

          -  hearing thresholds &gt; 70 dB SPL at 4 kHz and below (based on DPOAE 'no response' data
             from a similar protocol described in Bibliography Reference 32, Table 3). The last
             exclusion was adopted in an effort to increase the potential that DPOAEs will be
             measurable in a large number of subjects.
