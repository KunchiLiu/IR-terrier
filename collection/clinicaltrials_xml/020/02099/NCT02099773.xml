  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory and observational study focuses on adults with an intellectual disability
      (ID) and their support workers. Two groups of clients are observed: clients using Key Word
      Signing, and clients using aided Augmentative and Altenrative Communication (AAC).
      Approximately half of adults with ID is estimated to experience communication difficulties.
      AAC supports them in their daily communication aiming at optimal participation in society.
      Current communication models, such as Participation Model (Beukelman &amp; Mirenda, 2005) and
      International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO, 2001), regard both
      client-related and environmental factors as important elements of communication. A
      substantial part of the environmental factors is made up of the communication partners'
      characteristics. In daycare and residential services for adults with ID the support worker
      is an important communication partner .

      This study aims to:

        1. with regard to teaching Key Word Signing (KWS), a specific form of AAC, to support
           workers:

           Analyse the relation between training method, support workers' attitude, and short and
           long term sign knowledge.

        2. with regard to the use of AAC in everyday communication between support workers and
           adults with ID:

             -  Identity the support workers' characteristics that may influence the
                quality/quantity of the communication between adults with ID who use AAC and their
                support worker.

             -  Analyse the nature of this influence as well as any possible interaction effects
                with the clients' characteristics.

        3. Assess whether an existing instrument, designed for measuring interactions between
           parents and children with cerebral palsy using AAC, may be used with adults client and
           support workers.
