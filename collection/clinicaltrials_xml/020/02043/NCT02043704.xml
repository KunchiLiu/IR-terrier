  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of perioperative intravenous (IV)
      acetaminophen on postoperative narcotic consumption and pain scores in subjects undergoing
      vaginal reconstructive surgery. One hundred subjects will be randomly assigned to receive
      either IV acetaminophen or IV placebo. Those in the IV acetaminophen group will receive
      1000mg IV every 6 hours for 24 hours beginning prior to anesthesia induction. The control
      group will receive placebo saline infusions at the same time intervals. All subjects will
      receive as needed (prn) IV narcotic for additional pain relief. Visual analog scales (VAS)
      regarding pain will be evaluated at 18 and 24 hours postoperative and immediately prior to
      discharge. We will also collect total IV narcotic consumption. We hypothesize that subjects
      receiving IV acetaminophen will have lower VAS scores and decreased total narcotic
      consumption in comparison to the control group.

    <description>Post operative pain will be assessed 18 and 24 hours after surgery and immediately prior to discharge. Pain will be self reported by patients using a 10cm visual analog scale (VAS). At each time point a pain score will be collected for pain at rest and pain with ambulation or an action symbolizing ambulation (i.e. coughing).</description>
