    <textblock>
      This is a monocenter, single-arm, open label phase II trial evaluating the effect of SOM230
      LAR in adult patients with inoperable primary thymoma and thymoma metastasis (Masaoka
      II-IVa). SOM230 LAR in a dosage of 60 mg is administered i.m. once every 4 weeks. The
      purpose of this trial is a proof of concept.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating, or are of childbearing potential and
             not practicing a medically acceptable method of birth control. Female patients must
             use a secure method of contraception if sexually active and the partner should use a
             condom. If oral contraception is used, the patient must have been practicing this
             method for at least two months prior to enrollment and must agree to continue the
             oral contraceptive throughout the course of the study, and for three months after the
             study has ended. Male patients who are sexually active are required to use condoms
             during the study and for three months afterwards as a precautionary measure
             (available data do not suggest any increased reproductive risk with the study drugs).

             significant and which could affect the interpretation of the study results
