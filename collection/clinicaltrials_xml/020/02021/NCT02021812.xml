               3. Landing zone cannot be aneurysmal, heavily calcified, or heavily thrombosed

               4. Native aorta or previously implanted GORE® TAG® Device

          7. Must have appropriate LSA landing zone, defined as:

               1. LSA length of ≥3 cm proximal to first major branch vessel if using Aortic
                  Component with 8 mm portal diameter, or LSA length of ≥2.5 cm proximal to first
                  major branch vessel if using Aortic Component with 12 mm portal diameter
