  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fracture healing is a complex physiological process caused by interaction of cellular
      elements, cytokines and signaling proteins, which results in the formation of new bone.
      There is for now no universally accepted approach to evaluate the progression of fracture
      healing. Typically, a fracture is considered as a delayed-union when the bone has not united
      within a period of time that would be considered adequate for bone healing. Delayed-union
      suggests that union is slow but will eventually occur without additional surgical or
      non-surgical intervention, whereas non-union is defined as the cessation of all reparative
      process of healing.

      The incidence of impaired healing is estimated to range from 5 to 10% of all long bone
      fractures, depending on the fracture site, the type and degree of injury, among other
      factors. Currently the treatment of choice remains bone allograft or autograft. This
      procedure shows in general good results but requires an invasive surgery of several hours
      under general anesthesia, followed by a few days of hospitalization. Because of this, major
      complications have been reported in up to 20-30% of patients.

      The present Phase 1/2a study aims at demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ALLOB®, a
      proprietary population of allogeneic osteoblastic cells, in the treatment of delayed-union
      fractures of long bones. In this study, delayed-union is defined at the time of screening as
      a slow progression or an absence of healing of minimum 3 months after the onset of the
      fracture.
