      This study will assess the impact of lymphaticovenous microanastomosis in volume reduction
      of postmastectomy upper extremity lymphedema. We hypothesize that multiple lymphaticovenous
      micro-anastomosis in the distal arm will result in the reduction of volume and improvement
      in quality of life of patients with post-mastectomy lymphedema
