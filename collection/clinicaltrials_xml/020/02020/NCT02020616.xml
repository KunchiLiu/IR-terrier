    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the study drug
      known as LY3053102 in participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study drug will be
      given in different doses as an injection under the skin. The study is expected to last up to
      6 months for each participant. Participants may remain on stable-dose metformin as
      prescribed by their personal physician.
