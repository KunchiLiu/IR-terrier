    <textblock>
      The primary objective in this study is to evaluate bone scan response at Week 24 based on
      the quantified technetium-99 bone scan lesion area (BSLA). The safety of radium-223
      dichloride in combination with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide will be investigated. The
      study will evaluate radiological progression free survival, overall survival, and skeletal
      events. This study will also explore the clinical utility of different imaging modalities
      (whole body quantified technetium-99 bone scan, DW-MRI and NaF PET-CT scan) and will have a
      separate central radiological review for applicable secondary and exploratory imaging
      endpoints. All subjects will be randomized as assigned randomly by the IXRS system in a
      1:1:1 ratio into one of the treatment arms: radium-223 dichloride alone, 50 kBq/kg (55
      kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) every 4 weeks for up to 6 doses; radium-223
      dichloride, 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) every 4 weeks up to 6
      doses together with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg bid; radium-223
      dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) every 4 weeks up to 6
      doses together with enzalutamide 160 mg daily.The study will consist of screening, treatment
      and follow-up periods. Study will continue until disease progression as determined by
      investigator, or when patient meets criteria for withdrawal from study. Subjects in
      treatment arms with abiraterone/prednisone or enzalutamide will have the option to continue
      taking oral study therapy until the end of the study (2 years from the last dose of
      radium-223 dichloride) if the investigator deems the subject may benefit and there is no
      clinical or radiological progression. Subjects who discontinue all study treatment prior to
      2 years from last radium-223 dichloride treatment will enter active follow-up. During the
      active follow-up period, the subject will have a safety visit at the clinic every 12 weeks
      from the EOT for up to 2 years from the last dose of radium-223 dichloride. Beyond 2 years
      from last radium-223 dichloride treatment,subjects will enter long-term follow-up and will
      be followed via phone contact at intervals to assess for safety (hematological toxicity and
      new primary malignancies) and overall survival. A separate long-term safety follow-up study
      protocol is planned. Once implemented, the study subjects surviving after the end of the
      active follow-up will be transitioned to this separate long-term safety follow-up protocol.
