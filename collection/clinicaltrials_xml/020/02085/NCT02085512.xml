  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed work will evaluate the ability of neurocognitive retraining of executive
      functions and emotional regulation to reduce neurocognitive dysfunctions that follow trauma
      exposure and thereby prevent PTSD. The scientific rationale for this work is the hypothesis
      that impaired emotional regulation interferes with the expected recovery from the early
      responses to traumatic events, leading into a chronic disorder. In an initial phase the
      investigators will recruit 20 recently traumatized participants among trauma survivors
      admitted to a general hospital emergency room and test the planned intervention's acceptance
      and right 'dosing'. In the second phase the investigators will enroll 80 recent survivors
      into a randomized controlled study of the new intervention. The intervention will consist of
      web-based neurobehavioral training interventions that instill an emotional bias toward
      positive stimuli, improve emotion recognition and labeling, reduce resistance to emotional
      distraction, and enhance executive functioning. Control participants will complete web-based
      video games that do not have emotion-regulatory benefits. Outcome measures will include
      improvement in neurocognitive functioning and in PTSD symptoms.
