  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depending on the fracture pattern of patellar fractures tension band wiring,
      interfragmentary screw fixation or combinations are common treatments. But there are several
      problems associated with these techniques as fracture dislocation or loosening and
      perforation of the wire. Furthermore an anatomic reduction with stable fixation in
      comminuted fractures is almost impossible to achieve.

      A new option in the treatment of patellar fractures is the locking plate osteosynthesis,
      which provides a more stable fixation and higher mechanical strength in biomechanical tests
      compared to classic tension band wiring. Due to various screw positioning a stable fixation
      in comminuted fractures can be achieved and an early functional treatment with full weight
      bearing reduces the loss of knee-motion. Furthermore a removal of the osteosynthesis seems
      not to be essential anymore and the blood supply is not to be compromised.

      Because of the absent of clinical evidence investigators want to evaluate the clinical
      outcome after locking plate osteosyntheses in patellar fractures and compare patient
      satisfaction, functional motion, complications and number of revisions with common
      treatments.

    <description>The clinical short-term results after treating a patellar fracture with plate osteosynthesis are evaluated. Therefore functional motion is measured, complications and revision operations reviewed and knee-scores analyzed (Tegner-Score, Lysholm-Score, Kujala-Score, International Knee Documentation Committee - Subjective knee evaluation form).</description>
