      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a single oral dose of delafloxacin
      versus a single intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone in subjects with uncomplicated
      cervical, urethral, rectal, or pharyngeal gonorrhea.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a male or female 15 years of age or older.

          -  Subject must have had 1 or more of the following occur:

               1. gonorrhea with the NAAT or culture within the previous 14 days

               2. unprotected genital contact within 14 days with a person confirmed to be
                  infected with gonorrhea,

               3. gram-negative present in urogenital gram strain or male subject must present
                  with purulent urethritis or a female subject with must present with mucopurulent
                  cervical discharge

          -  Subject agrees to avoid unprotected sexual contact in order to minimize the risk of
             gonorrhea reinfection

          -  Subject must be in good health (ie, based on medical history), as determined by the
             investigator.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the subject must be able and willing to comply
             with protocol requirements. The subject must agree to provide reliable, verifiable
             contact information and agree to return for the Test-of-Cure Visit.

          -  If a subject's age is 15 years to less than the legal age of consent,a written,
             voluntarily signed assent must be obtained from the subject and a written,
             voluntarily signed informed consent must be signed by the subject's parent or legal
             guardian before the initiation of any study related procedures, unless the IRB/IEC
             determines that parent/legal guardian consent is not required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed, or suspected, complicated or systemic gonococcal infection, such as pelvic
             inflammatory disease, arthritis, or endocarditis.

          -  Subject has taken one of the following products within 6 hours of the Entry Visit
             that may interfere with the absorption of a quinolone antibiotic: magnesium/aluminum
             antacids; sucralfate; Videx® (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets; other highly
             buffered drugs; or other products containing calcium, iron, or zinc.

          -  Use of systemic or intravaginal antibiotics that are potentially effective against
             gonorrhea 4 weeks prior to study drug administration.

          -  Subjects with a current or prior history of seizures, and subjects being treated with
             drugs that are known to have a sizable potential of or reduce the threshold for
             inducing seizures (eg, bupropion, theophylline, and tricyclic and tetracyclic
             antidepressants).

          -  Current use of systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drugs.

          -  Known significant immunosuppression (eg, CD4 cell count &lt;200/mm3 or absolute
             neutrophil count &lt;500/mL).

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy during the previous 3 months.

          -  Subject is co-infected with an additional sexually transmitted disease (STD) for
             which treatment cannot be safely deferred until after the Test-of-Cure Visit unless
             the treatment is not potentially effective against gonorrhea.

          -  Subject has used an investigational drug or product within 30 days before study drug
             dosing.

          -  Medical history of Type 1 hypersensitivity to antibiotics of the quinolone or
             cephalosporin classes.

          -  Hysterectomized subjects without a cervix are ineligible.
