  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple-dose study in non-treatment seeking male and female subjects with
      moderate to severe opioid use disorder who meet criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) to evaluate the effectiveness of RBP-6000 to
      block exogenous opioids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A study of RBP-6000 300 mg administered via subcutaneous depot injections using the ATRIGEL
      Delivery System to determine whether there is a difference in the average score of
      subjective-effects questionnaires completed by study participants (using a visual analog
      scale (VAS)) after administering 6 mg or 18 mg hydromorphone compared to 0 mg hydromorphone
      (placebo) as an opioid blockade test (challenge).

    <description>Hydromorphone challenges are administered during the screening period (days -17 to -15), on days -3 to -1 during the buprenorphine and naloxone (SUBOXONE film) stabilization period, and weekly during the 12-week treatment period after administration of RBP-6000 (300-mg in a single subcutaneous injection on Days 1 and 29). Challenges consist of participants taking hydromorphone on three consecutive days at 0 mg (placebo), 6 mg and 18 mg doses.</description>

Each challenge consists of 3 days during which participants are administered 0 mg (placebo), 6 mg and 18 mg hydromorphone via intramuscular injection daily in varying blinded sequences.
Hydromorphone can also be earned during the Reinforcing effects tasks and up to the same randomized dose received in the hydromorphone challenge that morning can be earned (or money can be chosen).</description>
