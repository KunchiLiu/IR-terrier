  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in
      participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors that are positive for
      programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1): the hypothesis is that treatment with pembrolizumab
      will result in a clinically meaningful Overall Response Rate (ORR).

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>On-study imaging was to be performed every 9 weeks after the first dose of study drug, or more frequently if clinically indicated. ORR is defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug, is also an AE. After discontinuation of study drug, each participant was monitored for a minimum of 30 days for AE monitoring (serious AEs were monitored for up to 90 days after last dose of study drug).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded independent central radiologists' review or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Using RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as either a 20% relative increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study OR an absolute increase of &gt;5 mm the sum of lesions, OR the appearance of new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) by RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study). DOR was censored at the last tumor assessment date if a responder did not have PD or death. Non-responders were not included in the analysis. The lower and upper limits were estimated at the time of data cutoff. DOR was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to death due to any cause. OS is reported in months.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug, is also an AE. After discontinuation of study drug, each participant was monitored for a minimum of 30 days for AE monitoring (serious AEs were monitored for up to 90 days after last dose of study drug).</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS) by RECIST 1.1</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded independent central radiologists’ review or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Using RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as either a 20% relative increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study OR an absolute increase of &gt;5 mm the sum of lesions, OR the appearance of new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in months.</description>
