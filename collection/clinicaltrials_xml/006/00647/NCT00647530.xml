      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving chemotherapy
      before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs
      to be removed. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after
      surgery. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy is more effective with or without
      panitumumab in treating patients with colon cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving fluorouracil together with
      oxaliplatin and panitumumab to see how well it works compared with giving fluorouracil and
      oxaliplatin without panitumumab in treating patients with high-risk colon cancer that can be
      removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without panitumumab followed by
           deferred surgery and completion of chemotherapy postoperatively can reduce the 2-year
           recurrence as compared to surgery and postoperative chemotherapy with or without
           panitumumab.

        -  To determine if adding panitumumab in the neoadjuvant treatment produces a measurable
           increase in antitumor efficacy as measured by tumor shrinkage.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the accuracy of pre-treatment CT scan staging.

        -  To assess the tolerability of the neoadjuvant therapies.

        -  To assess the nature and frequency of surgical complications.

        -  To measure the impact of the treatments on quality of life and on resource usage.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (&lt; 50 year vs
      50-59 years vs 60-69 years vs ≥ 70 years), radiological T-stage (T3 vs T4), radiological
      nodal status (Nx vs N0 vs N1 vs N2), site of primary tumor, proposed chemotherapy (OxMdG vs
      OxCap), and defunctioning colostomy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive 1 of the 2 following treatment regimens:

        -  OxMdG: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV and folinic acid IV over 2 hours followed by
           fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on day 1 for 1 course.

        -  OxCap: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine
           twice daily on days 1-15 for 1 course.

      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy:

             -  Arm I: Patients receive 1 of the following chemotherapy regimens:

                  -  OxMdG: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV
                     continuously over 46 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 3
                     courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

                  -  OxCap: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral
                     capecitabine twice daily on days 1-15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2
                     courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive 1 of the following regimens:

                  -  OxMdG + panitumumab: Patients receive panitumumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1
                     followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV continuously over
                     46 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 3 courses in the
                     absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

                  -  OxCap + panitumumab: Patients receive panitumumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1
                     followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice
                     daily on days 1-15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the
                     absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Approximately 52 days after beginning chemotherapy, patients in both arms proceed to
      surgery.

        -  Surgery: Patients in both arms undergo surgical resection of the primary tumor.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning 4-8 weeks after completion of surgery, patients receive
           adjuvant treatment on the same arm for which they received neoadjuvant therapy.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive either nine 2-week courses of OxMdG therapy or six 3-week
                courses of OxCap therapy.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive twelve 2-week courses of OxMdG therapy concurrently with
                panitumumab given every 2 weeks OR eight 3-week courses of OxCap therapy
                concurrently with panitumumab given every 3 weeks.

      Tumor tissue is collected during surgery and blood samples are collected periodically for
      biomarker studies. Samples are analyzed for the detection of k-ras mutations; the detection
      of EGFR expression and/or functional genetic polymorphisms of the EGFR gene via PCR; the
      detection of copy number EGFR gene amplification via fluorescence in situ hybridization
      (FISH); the detection of EGFR activation via immunohistochemistry (IHC); the detection of
      EGFR by downstream parameters via western blotting and/or gene expression microarray
      techniques; for proteomics; and for epigenetics.

      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline, at first course of
      postoperative chemotherapy, and at 1 year following randomization.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years and
      then annually thereafter.
