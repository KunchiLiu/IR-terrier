      Patients eligible to enroll into this rollover protocol will begin study treatment within
      2-5 days of their Day 28 study termination visit in Protocol 501-CL-003. Patients who met
      the primary efficacy response criterion in Protocol 501-CL-003 will continue receiving the
      same study treatment to which they were assigned in the previous protocol in a
      double-blinded manner, these being one of the following 5 treatments:

        -  AKR-501 2.5 mg daily

        -  AKR-501 5 mg daily

        -  AKR-501 10 mg daily

        -  AKR-501 20 mg daily

        -  Placebo

      Patients who did not meet the primary efficacy response criterion in Protocol 501-CL-003 who
      otherwise meet the eligibility criteria for this rollover protocol will be offered open
      label AKR-501 10 mg daily.

      This is a parallel group, rollover study.
