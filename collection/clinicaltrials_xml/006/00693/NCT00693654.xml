          -  Subjects with history of pruritus predating renal failure and subjects with skin
             disease unrelated to uremia, such as atopic dermatitis, will be excluded.

          -  Use of systemic medications for treatment of pruritus including corticosteroids
             within the past 4 weeks and during the study.
