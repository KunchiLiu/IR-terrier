    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to examine the physiological and metabolic effects of a
      16-week circuit-training (strength training + aerobic activities) program, with and without
      a behavioral component utilizing motivational interviewing, in 45 overweight Latina
      adolescent girls (14-18 years of age). This 16-week randomized control study will examine
      the incremental effects of the following 3 intervention groups on insulin sensitivity,
      insulin secretion, adiposity, and habitual and ad libitum physical activity:

        -  Control group (delayed circuit training intervention; n=15)

        -  Circuit training group (strength + aerobic training; 2 times per week; n=15)

        -  Circuit training (same as above) + weekly motivational interviewing sessions (n=15)

      Specific Aim 1: To examine the effects of a 16-week circuit training program on adiposity,
      insulin dynamics, other associated hormones and adipocytokines, cardiorespiratory fitness,
      and muscular strength in overweight Latina adolescent girls. Hypothesis 1: Participation in
      the circuit-training program will result in significant improvements in both physiological
      and metabolic outcomes, including: a) body composition as measured by DEXA, b) fat
      distribution as measured by MRI, c) adipose tissue hormones (e.g. leptin, adiponectin,
      TNF-α) as measured by fasting blood samples, d) insulin sensitivity and secretion as
      measured by frequently sampled intravenous tolerance test, e) aerobic fitness as measured by
      the single stage submaximal treadmill test, and f) increase muscular strength as measured by
      repetition maximums.

      Specific Aim 2: To examine the incremental effects of adding the motivational interviewing
      sessions to the circuit training on self-selected ad libitum physical activity during a
      5-hour observational period, habitual physical activity levels using 7 day accelerometry,
      and the meanings and motivation to exercise using questionnaires before and after the
      intervention. Hypothesis 2: The addition of motivational interviewing will encourage and
      empower participants to be more active outside of the intervention and foster healthy
      physical activity behaviors in daily life. Improvements in physical activity behaviors will
      lead to greater improvements in all other health outcomes listed in specific aim 1 compared
      to circuit training alone and control group.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At Risk of Overweight and Overweight (age- &amp; sex-specific body mass index ≥ 85th
             percentile based on CDC BMI growth charts [US Department of Health and Human
             Services, 2000]. There will not be an upper BMI limit. In our experience, we have had
             numerous children above the 99th percentile for BMI complete the outcome measures,
             and this group could benefit greatly from participation.

          -  Gender &amp; Age: Females from grades 9th to 12th (approximately 14-18 years of age). We
             chose to study adolescents because pubertal youth will likely possess the requisite
             hormonal milieu needed to elicit physiologically and metabolic changes in response to
             resistance and aerobic training. In addition physical activity declines are more
             pronounced in minority females. By limiting the study to just females, we will retain
             a more homogenous group. This will eliminate sensitive gender issues related to
             exercise such as body image concerns, goal setting, and motivations for behavioral
             changes. To reduce effects of the menstrual cycle, all females will be tested during
             the follicular phase, while those with irregular/unpredictable menses will be studied
             at random times.

          -  Latino origin all four grandparents must be of Hispanic heritage (reported on
             screening forms). This approach is consistent with all of our previous and ongoing
             work.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presently taking medication(s) or diagnosed with any syndrome or disease that could
             influence physical activity, body composition and fat distribution, or insulin
             action.

          -  Previously diagnosed with any major illness since birth (e.g. chronic birth asphyxia,
             cancer, etc.).

          -  Children with type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes will be excluded and referred to a
             physician. Children with impaired glucose tolerance (fasting glucose &gt;100 mg/dL
             during a fasting blood draw) and/or conditions associated with insulin resistance
             (e.g. acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia) will be eligible, as long as
             they are not receiving treatment and meet other eligibility criteria.

          -  Children who have any physical, cognitive, or psychological disabilities that would
             prevent them from participating in an exercise program.

          -  Currently, or in the past 6 months, involved with any dietary, physical activity or
             weight loss program.

          -  Children who live farther than 20 miles away from the GCRC.
