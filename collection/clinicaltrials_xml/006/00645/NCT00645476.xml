    <textblock>
      Memantine is a glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist which has shown efficacy in cognitive
      dysfunction due to moderate to severe Alzheimer disease (Reisberg et al., 2003).

      The investigators propose to treat 75 subjects with bipolar disorder with minimal mood
      symptoms and cognitive dysfunction with memantine or placebo. The 75 subjects will be
      enrolled at three sites. The same study will be performed at all three sites, with each site
      functioning independently of the other.

      The investigators study will include objective neuropsychological testing of memory and
      executive functions before and after treatment, as well as ratings of mood symptoms and
      subjective patient ratings of memory function at every study visit.

      The principal aim of this study is to measure the efficacy of memantine on improving memory
      function in minimally symptomatic subjects with bipolar disorder. The investigators
      hypothesize that in minimally symptomatic subjects with bipolar disorder memantine will be
      efficacious in improving cognitive functions, as measured by the difference in
      neuropsychological test scores at the beginning and at the end of the trial.

      Secondary analyses will test the role of memantine in improving residual mood symptoms
      (depression and mania) in subjects with bipolar disorder.

      Demonstrating the role of memantine in reducing cognitive dysfunction in minimally
      symptomatic subjects with bipolar disorder promises to provide important clinical
      information, which could lead to improvements in well-being and functional status for large
      populations of subjects with bipolar disorder.

      There will be an optional open label 12-week extension to the study. Subjects will be
      restarted on memantine similar to the regimen in the first phase of the study. Subjects will
      meet with the investigators every four weeks (weeks 16, 20, and 24) for assessment as
      mentioned above. Neuropsychological testing will be repeated at week 24. It is the
      investigator's belief that this added timeline will better demonstrate any improvements in
      cognitive function.

      Study: MEMANTINE AND COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IN BIPOLAR DISORDER The study design involves
      double-blind, prospective, and longitudinal treatment with flexible doses of memantine or
      placebo for 12 weeks in minimally symptomatic subjects with bipolar disorder and memory
      dysfunction. We will use objective neuropsychological testing of memory functions before and
      after treatment, as well as subjective patient ratings of memory throughout the treatment.

      The primary analysis will compare neuropsychological test scores before and after treatment
      among subjects treated with memantine or placebo.

      A minimum of 25 subjects with bipolar disorder will be enrolled. We will enroll subjects
      with bipolar disorder, diagnosed with the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for
      DSM-IV-TR Mood Module (SCID Mood Module) (screen visit only). Subjects will have baseline
      scores on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and on the Young Mania Rating Scale
      of 10 or lower. Both of these instruments will be administered by trained raters.
