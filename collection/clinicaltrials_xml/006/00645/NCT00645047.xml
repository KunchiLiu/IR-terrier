      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is considered a major public health problem in the
      U.S. due to its high prevalence and high rates of disability associated with the disorder.
      For thousands of veterans, PTSD is a chronic disorder, resulting directly from military
      service that causes substantial psychological suffering and social disability. Barriers to
      PTSD care include poor access, mistrust, and lack of benefit from traditional treatments.
      This project addresses two very important and timely questions. First, can telemedicine be
      used as a tool to extend effective, specialized mental health services such as, cognitive
      processing therapy (CPT), to veterans with poor access to care? Second, does therapy
      delivered by telemedicine effect the quality of care in terms of clinical outcomes (PTSD
      severity, Quality of Life), and the quality of patient-therapist interaction (patient
      satisfaction &amp; communication)? By answering these questions, this study will provide
      valuable knowledge for VA researchers, clinicians, and policy makers. The study findings
      will have direct implications related to making specific recommendations regarding
      telemedicine utilization to deliver specialized mental health services for veterans
      suffering from PTSD.

      Anticipated Impact on Veterans' Healthcare: This project addresses two very important and
      timely questions related to the VHA's mission to provide state of the art care to OEF and
      OIF veterans. First, can telemedicine be used as a tool to extend effective, specialized
      mental health services such as, cognitive processing therapy (CPT), to veterans with poor
      access to care? Second, does therapy delivered by telemedicine effect the quality of care in
      terms of clinical outcomes (PTSD severity, Quality of Life), and the quality of
      patient-therapist interaction (patient satisfaction &amp; communication)? By answering these
      questions, this study will provide valuable knowledge for VA researchers, clinicians, and
      policy makers. The study findings will have direct implications related to making specific
      recommendations regarding telemedicine utilization to deliver specialized mental health
      services for veterans suffering from PTSD.

      Project Background/Rationale: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is considered a major
      public health problem in the U.S. due to its high prevalence and high rates of disability
      associated with the disorder. For thousands of veterans, PTSD is a chronic disorder,
      resulting directly from military service that causes substantial psychological suffering and
      social disability. Barriers to PTSD care include poor access, mistrust, and lack of benefit
      from traditional treatments.

      However, recently developed evidenced based treatments like CPT are very effective.
      Unfortunately, these treatments are not widely available, as a large proportion of veterans
      live in rural communities and have poor access to specialized mental health care. The VA
      hospital system currently supports sophisticated telemedicine technology that can provide
      CPT to veterans in their home communities. The proposed project will assess the quality of
      CPT provided via telemedicine and its impact on outcomes, and is therefore, directly related
      to the VA's mission to provide advanced, accessible, and high quality health care to all
      eligible veterans regardless of place of residence: &quot;Right care in the right place, at the
      right time&quot;.

      Project Objectives: The objective of the proposed study is to conduct a systematic
      comparison of PTSD outcomes for veterans receiving cognitive processing therapy via
      telemedicine vs. in-person care. The patient-therapist relationship is central in
      establishing an effective therapeutic relationship and is strongly influenced by
      communication. Consequently, this project will also compare provider-patient communication
      during telemedicine consultations vs. in-person consultations.

      Project Methods: We propose a randomized clinical trial of 254 patients receiving cognitive
      processing therapy either via telemedicine or by in-person care. Telemedicine visits will
      occur at La Jolla VA in San Diego and in-person visits will occur at the Mission Valley VA
      Clinic in San Diego. Veterans with PTSD will be enrolled from the primary care and mental
      health clinics at the above sites. Clinical services will be provided by 10 participating
      providers with specialized training in CPT. Therapy will be provided over 12 weekly sessions
      lasting 60 minutes each. Previously validated and widely used measures of PTSD symptom
      severity (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, PTSD Checklist ) and health related quality of
      life (SF-36) will be measured at baseline, at completion of therapy, and at 6 months
      follow-up. In addition, we will measure and compare the quality of verbal and non-verbal
      patient-provider communication for in-person and telemedicine visits via video recordings of
      visits, which will be analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analyses System. Patient and
      provider satisfaction will be measured post therapy with previously validated
      questionnaires. Statistical methods will include descriptive analyses, reliability analyses,
      and hypothesis testing using linear mixed models.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary diagnosis of chronic PTSD due to combat; co-morbid mood and anxiety disorders
             are expected, and will be permitted (to maximize generalizability) if PTSD symptoms
             are judged to be predominant based on primacy and severity of symptoms; the proposed
             treatment often ameliorates depression and anxiety symptoms;

          2. age 18 or older; and

          3. English fluency.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. unmanaged dementia, psychosis or manic episodes in past year;

          2. substance abuse or alcohol dependence in past year as measured by AUDIT;

          3. concurrent psychotherapies targeting PTSD or depression (veterans who are engaged in
             treatment for non-PTSD symptoms, for example, 12-step programs for substance
             problems, will be eligible);

          4. severe cardiovascular or respiratory disease that would make it difficult to ensure
             regular attendance at psychotherapy sessions;

          5. severe impairments in speech, vision, or hearing; and

          6. head trauma resulting in loss of consciousness longer than 20 minutes.
