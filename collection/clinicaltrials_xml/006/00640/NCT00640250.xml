      We propose a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized study comparing the
      diagnostic performance (primary) and safety (secondary) of 3 concentrations of Disperse blue
      106 and 4 concentrations of Bronopol in 40 adult subjects (20 subjects per allergen) with a
      clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test (current or previous) to
      the corresponding reference petrolatum allergen (&quot;sensitives&quot;).

      Primary endpoint:

      To evaluate the diagnostic performance of Disperse blue 106 and Bronopol T.R.U.E. Test
      allergens in 20 adult subjects per allergen with a clinical history of contact dermatitis
      and a positive patch test to the respective reference allergen. Evaluations will include:

        -  Determination of the lowest concentration eliciting positive skin reactions (+1 or +2)
           in 70-90% of sensitive subjects.

        -  Frequency of positive, negative, doubtful and irritant reactions for each allergen and
           tested concentration.

        -  Concordance/discordance as compared to the corresponding reference petrolatum allergen.

      Secondary endpoint:

      To evaluate the safety of Disperse blue 106 and Bronopol T.R.U.E. Test allergens in 20 adult
      subjects per allergen with a clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch
      test to the respective reference allergen. Evaluations will include:

        -  The frequency of tape-induced irritation at the test site, incomplete panel adhesion,
           and subject-reported sensations of itching or burning.

        -  The frequency and characterization of adverse events and serious adverse events.

        -  The frequency and characterization of late and/or persistent reactions.
