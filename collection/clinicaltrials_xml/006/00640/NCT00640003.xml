      This research is being done to find out if Baclofen, a medicine that is often used for the
      treatment of abnormal stiffness, might also be useful to treat some of the neurologic
      problems caused by ataxia telangiectasia (A-T). The investigators also want to find out if
      there are better ways to measure the problems of ataxia and abnormal eye movement for future
      studies of medication in ataxia telangiectasia.

    <description>Drug given by orally via capsules. Escalation steps in 4-day intervals. Step 1: 5mg QAM. Step 2: 5mg BID. Step 3: 5mg TID. Step 4: 10mg QAM, 5mg BID. Step 5: 10mg BID, 5mg QMid-day. Step 6: 10mg TID. Step 6 will last up to 2 weeks. De-escalation will start from highest dose step and work backwards in 2-day intervals. Complete drug administration of escalating, staying constant at 10mg TID and de-escalating will be done with both drug and placebo.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Teenagers over 12 years old and young adults with A-T may join if they have been
             evaluated previously in the A-T Clinical Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital and have a
             measurable abnormality of eye movement.

          -  Patients who are presently taking Baclofen will be eligible for the study if they are
             presently receiving the medication under the direction of Dr. Crawford in the ATCC,
             and are willing to withdraw from the medication for a period of one month prior to
             the initial screening visit.

          -  Female patients who are sexually active will be given a standard serum HCG pregnancy
             test.

          -  Those who are sexually active will be counseled about necessary precautions against
             pregnancy during the duration of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:
