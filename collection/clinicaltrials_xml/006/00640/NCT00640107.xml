  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic imaging technology that
      produces images of the body. This technology does not utilize radiation, as does Computed
      Tomography (CT) but relies on radio waves and a strong magnet to produce images.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate new commercially available MR imaging sequence
      and/or hardware that have been installed on an existing MR unit or to evaluate a new MR
      unit. The study also serves to familiarize the MR technical staff with how to operate the
      new equipment. The information obtained will be used to optimize new MR equipment that has
      been installed on the MR scanner

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been utilized for 20 years as a clinical and research
      tool at SUNY Upstate Medical University. Currently, there are five (5) MR (1 low-field 0.2
      Tesla, 3 high-field 1.5 Tesla and 1 3.0 Tesla) units in use on the university campus. During
      this time, new imaging sequences and hardware including smaller more powerful magnets and
      faster computers have been developed that assist in the diagnosis of many disease processes.
      MR Angiography, MR Spectroscopy, diffusion weighted imaging and a dedicated combination
      Neurovascular head and neck coil are just several of the many imaging sequences and
      specialized coils that have been developed over the last several years.

      New imaging sequences and hardware including 4.0 and 7.0 Tesla magnets are currently
      undergoing development and testing at several universities in the United States and
      worldwide. As a consequence of the many new innovations in MR imaging we must periodically
      upgrade our existing MR units and on occasion replace one of our existing MR units or
      purchase a new MR unit. This will ensure that we have the most up to date MR equipment to
      provide state of the art diagnostic imaging capabilities at University Hospital. The new
      imaging sequences and/or hardware must be optimized for each MR unit to achieve the highest
      signal to noise (SNR) and contrast to noise (CNR) ratios in a reasonable scan time. This
      practice is routinely performed at every university and private hospital as well as
      outpatient imaging center when a new MR unit is installed and when an existing unit is
      upgraded
