    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of autologous platelet gel (APG) on
      sternal incision and conduit sites will improve wound healing and decrease the incidence of
      infection in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient who meets criteria and consents to undergo a CABG procedure involving
             conduit sites and consents to this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient, after inclusion, whom is later determined to have had on-going therapy
             that could influence wound healing such as radiation or chemotherapy, extensive
             steroid use, or accidental trauma such as burns, etc.
