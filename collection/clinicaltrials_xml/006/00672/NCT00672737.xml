  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We would like to test the effect of opioid medication on pain sensitivity in subjects who
      have been diagnosed with a sleep disorder called Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) compared to
      other subjects without OSA. Patients with OSA may have an altered sensitivity to the
      sedative, analgesic, and respiratory depressant effects of opioids.

      The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that patients who suffer from
      moderate-to-severe OSA have increased pain thresholds and are more sensitive to the
      analgesic effects of opioids compared to patients with normal sleep-related breathing
      physiology. We will evaluate the effect of remifentanil, a short acting mu-opioid receptor
      agonist, on pain using an experimental heat and cold-induced pain tests, and compare it
      between volunteers with and without a polysomnography (PSG)-based diagnosis of obstructive
      sleep apnea.
