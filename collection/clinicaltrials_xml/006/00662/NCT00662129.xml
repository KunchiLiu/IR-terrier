      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation and gemcitabine together with bevacizumab works in treating
      patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate of patients with metastatic
           breast cancer treated with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation,
           gemcitabine hydrochloride, and bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the adverse event profile of this regimen.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  To determine the confirmed response rate, duration of response, and time to treatment
           failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30
      minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and after every other course, and then after
      completion of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
