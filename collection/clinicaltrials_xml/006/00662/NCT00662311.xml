      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given
      together with paclitaxel and radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating
      patients unable to tolerate cisplatin with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that
      cannot be removed by surgery. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.
      Giving vorinostat together with paclitaxel and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat when administered in
      combination with paclitaxel and thoracic radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced
      NSCLC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and toxicity of vorinostat when administered in combination with
      paclitaxel and thoracic radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.

      II. To determine the radiological response rate, by computed tomography (CT) scan, of
      vorinostat when administered in combination with paclitaxel and thoracic radiation therapy
      in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.

      III. To describe the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of this
      regiment over 3 years of follow up.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of vorinostat followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD), 5 days a week and paclitaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once a week. Patients also undergo radiation therapy QD, 5
      days a week. Treatment repeats every week for 7 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 12 weeks, every 3
      months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
