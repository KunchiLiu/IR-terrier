      This is a study comparing the benefits of two types of individual psychotherapy
      (cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis and supportive therapy) in outpatients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Treatment lasts 6 months and there are multiple
      assessment points.

      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing 6 months of participation in one of two
      active treatments, cognitive-behavior therapy for psychosis or supportive therapy.
      Assessments of clinical status and social functioning will be obtained at baseline,
      mid-treatment, end of treatment, and 6 month follow-up. We hypothesize that participation in
      the cognitive-behavioral therapy will lead to greater reductions in symptoms and
      improvements in social functioning.
