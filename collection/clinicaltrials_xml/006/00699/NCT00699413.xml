  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a combination of hydroxcycitrate
      (HCA) and niacin-bound chromium, in conjunction with nutrition education, over a twelve week
      period. Participants will be evaluated with regard to BMI, percent body fat, insulin
      activity, and hunger.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity among youth has increased dramatically in recent years. Parallel
      to the increased rates of pediatric obesity, overweight children present clinically with
      adiposity related comorbidities such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The
      prevailing recommendations for overweight youth are to increase physical activity levels and
      limit energy intake in order to improve body composition. Currently there is little
      empirical evidence to support the efficacy of these recommendations. Alternatively, evidence
      in adults suggests that nutritional supplementation with (-) hydroxycitric acid (HCA), an
      organic acid found naturally in citrus fruits, and chromium may lead to favorable changes in
      body composition and improve glucose regulation. To date, these issues have not been tested
      in youth. Therefore, the purpose of the present investigation is to examine the effects of a
      nutritional education program combined with either HCA + chromium or placebo on measures of
      body composition and glucose regulation in overweight adolescents.

    <description>After all baseline measures have been completed, participants will be randomly assigned to either the nutrition education + supplement group, or the nutrition education + placebo group. The length of the intervention is twelve weeks. Nutrition classes will take place once a week for 1 1/2 hours. Subjects will be encouraged to increase fiber and decrease sugar intake. They will also be separated into gender-specific classes.
Active and inactive supplements will be identical in appearance and taste. Active supplements will contain 2,700 mgs/day of Super CitriMax (hydroxycitrate)and 400 µg per day of ChromeMate (niacin-bound Chromium). Supplements will be in powder and tablet form, and should be taken 30 minutes prior to each meal.</description>
