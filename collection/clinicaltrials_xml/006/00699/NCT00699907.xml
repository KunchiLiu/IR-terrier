      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue in the laboratory from patients with a high
      risk of developing ovarian cancer may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers
      related to cancer. It may also help doctors learn more about the effects of flutamide on
      biomarkers.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the effect of flutamide on biomarkers in blood and
      tissue samples from patients at high risk of ovarian cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify biomarkers of flutamide action in ovarian epithelial cells after 6 weeks of
           treatment with flutamide in patients at high risk for ovarian cancer.

        -  Examine the effect of flutamide in these patients.

        -  Compare the results of this pilot study in patients at high risk for ovarian cancer who
           are undergoing prophylactic oophorectomy and are interested in taking flutamide vs
           patients at high risk for ovarian cancer who are undergoing prophylactic oophorectomy
           and are not interested in taking flutamide (control) vs patients who are undergoing
           oophorectomy for a medical indication (control).

      OUTLINE: Patients who elect not to receive flutamide undergo prophylactic oophorectomy or
      oophorectomy for a medical indication. Patients who elect to receive flutamide are
      randomized to 125mg/day.

      Interested patients who elect to receive flutamide receive oral flutamide once daily for 6
      weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo prophylactic
      oophorectomy.

      All patients undergo blood and ovarian tissue sample collection at the time of surgery for
      biomarker laboratory studies. Proteomic, microarray, and polymorphism analysis are performed
      on the blood and tissue samples.
