    <description>The dose level of the initial cohort will be 5 µg/kg. Cohorts will be at doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.... µg/kg until toxicity supervenes. Following the identification of the MTCD, the MTCD cohort will be expanded to 12 subjects. Dose escalation to a new cohort may not occur until authorization by the medical monitor, which will require all patients from the prior cohorts have reached cycle 1 day 21 without dose limiting toxicity (DLT) if eligible for retreatment</description>

             sorter (FACS) analysis or; ≥ 15 % of malignant cells from a disease site CD22+ by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC).

        Stage of disease:

             hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), have refused HSCT, or have disease
             activity that prohibits HSCT at that time;

          -  Relapse after prior autologous or allogeneic HSCT is allowed. In the event of relapse

        Subjects with the following CNS status, are eligible only in the absence of neurologic
        symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial nerve palsy:

          -  CNS 1, defined as absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on cytospin
             preparation, regardless of the number of WBCs;

          -  CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/µL WBCs in CSF and cytospin positive for blasts, or
             &gt; 5/µL WBCs but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm:

          -  CNS 2b: ≥ 10/µL RBCs; &lt; 5/µL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts;

          -  CNS 2c: ≥ 10/µL RBCs; ≥ 5/µL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts but negative by

        Ability to give informed consent according to applicable regulatory or state requirements.
        In the United States: For subjects &lt; 18 years old their legal guardian must give informed
        consent. Pediatric subjects will be included in age appropriate discussion and verbal
        assent will be obtained for those ≥ 7 years of age;

        Must be between the ages of greater than or equal to 6 months and &lt; 25 years;
