  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral clofarabine is related to two intravenous chemotherapy drugs used for this disease and
      works in two different ways. It affects the development of new cancer cells by blocking two
      enzymes that cancer cells need to reproduce. When these enzymes are blocked, the cancer call
      can no longer prepare the DNA needed to make new cells. Clofarabine also encourages existing
      cancer cells to die by disturbing components within the cancer cell. This causes the release
      of a substance that is fatal to the cell.

      The phase I component of this research study is complete and demonstrated encouraging safety
      and efficacy in low-grade B-cell lymphomas. The phase II component of the trial is accruing
      to further study the efficacy of oral clofarabine in the treatment of relapsed non-Hodgkin
      lymphomas.

      -  Each treatment cycle lasts four weeks during which time the participant will be taking
           study drug for the first three weeks only. Participants will be supplied with a study
           medication-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle.

        -  Clofarabine is a tablet that will be taken orally in the morning once daily on days 1
           through 21 of each 28-day cycle. Participants can receive up to a total of 6 cycles if
           they do not experience any unacceptable side effects and if their cancer does not get
           worse.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at specified intervals through out
           the treatment period: blood tests, physical examinations, vital signs, radiological
           exams and urine tests.
