      1200 patients will have wireless monitors attached to their arm. They will be randomized to
      have their vital signs filtered through software that generates alerts, or software that
      does not generate alerts. Low and high limit alarms will be set according to published
      guidelines and adjusted at will by the response team. If appropriate the Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center Rapid Response team will be initiated per Institutional Policy
