      RATIONALE: Pemetrexed may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving pemetrexed together with cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving pemetrexed together with
      cisplatin and to see how well it works in treating patients with advanced, persistent, or
      recurrent cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the antitumor activity of pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin with objective
           tumor response (partial and complete response) in patients with advanced, persistent,
           or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effects of this regimen on progression-free survival and overall
           survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior cisplatin
      therapy as a radiosensitizer (yes vs no).

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1-4 hours on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
