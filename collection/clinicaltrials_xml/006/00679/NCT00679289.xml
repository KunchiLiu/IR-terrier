  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the combination regimen of KW2871
      and high dose Interferon-alfa2b (HDI) in patients with metastatic melanoma (skin cancer that
      has spread to other parts of the body).

      KW2871 is an antibody that is made in a laboratory. Antibodies are part of the immune
      system. KW2871 attaches to the GD3 ganglioside (a molecule that is found on melanoma cells).
      This may help slow or stop the growth of melanoma tumors.

      Interferon-alfa 2b is a man-made version of interferon. Interferons are among a number of
      substances produced by the immune system in response to the presence of enemy cells. Not
      only does it &quot;interfere&quot; with foreign invaders that may cause infection, but it can prevent
      the growth and spread of other diseased cells as well, including some types of cancer cells.
      Interferons have been shown to be effective against a variety of tumors.

      This is an open label study of KW2871 plus high dose IFN-Î±2b (HDI) in patients with
      measurable metastatic melanoma. All eligible patients will receive KW2871 IV every two weeks
      (Wednesday) starting on week 1. HDI will also be given at a dose of 20 MU/m2 IV for five
      consecutive days (Monday thru Friday) per week for four weeks, and then 10 MU/m2 sc three
      times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). Patients will be treated with KW2871-HDI
      combination therapy until disease progression requiring treatment intervention that would
      interfere with the interpretation of the study results.

             active treatment, except for treated melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancer and
             cervical and breast carcinoma in situ

          2. Mental impairment that may compromise the ability to give informed consent and comply
             with the study requirements

          3. Participation in any other clinical trial involving chemotherapy, radiotherapy or

             immunomodulatory or immunosuppressant medications (i.e. corticosteroids,
             cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, other biologics). Corticosteroids at substitution
             doses are allowed

          8. Metastatic brain disease is allowed provided that appropriate treatment has been
             administered (surgery or irradiation) and two month follow-up by brain MRI shows
             disease control (stability or regression)

          9. Autoimmune-related hypothyroidism and vitiligo-like depigmentation are allowed

             obstructive or restrictive pulmonary diseases, active systemic infections requiring
             antibiotics, serious intercurrent illness requiring hospitalization, inflammatory
             bowel disorders, or significant psychiatric disease, which in the opinion of the
             principal investigator would prevent adequate informed consent or render study
             treatment unsafe or contraindicated.

         11. Subjects with clinical suspicion of HIV or hepatitis will undergo the following viral
             tests:

               -  HBV (hepatitis B virus): subjects must have negative antigens

               -  HCV (hepatitis C virus): subjects must have a negative test for serum antibodies

                    -  If any of the tests are positive patients will be excluded from the study
