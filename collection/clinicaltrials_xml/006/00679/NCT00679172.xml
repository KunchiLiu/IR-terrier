  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the typhoid
      fever vaccine candidate M01ZH09 manufactured at commercial scale, at a new manufacturing
      facility. The vaccine will be delivered as a single oral dose to healthy, typhoid
      vaccine-naïve adults.
