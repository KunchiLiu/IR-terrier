  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain in patients following total hip replacement seems to be a significant problem.
      Previous research has shown that more effective pain management in the early postoperative
      period may decrease the incidence of the development of chronic pain states.

      This study will evaluate whether ketorolac (a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) given
      into the spinal fluid before surgery will reduce the area of sensitivity (or pain to light
      touch) following surgery. Patients will be monitored during their postoperative hospital
      stay and then contacted by telephone at 8 weeks and 6 months after surgery and questioned
      about any pain they are having at their surgical site. Patients that are still experiencing
      pain at 6 months will be asked to return to the medical center for the study staff to assess
      their pain or sensitivity at the surgical site.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgery results in hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli surrounding the wound and in a
      subset of patients, also results in chronic pain. The purpose of the study is to test
      whether intrathecal ketorolac, by selectively and effectively blocking cyclooxygenase in the
      spinal cord, will reduce hypersensitivity surrounding the surgical wound in patients with
      high risk for developing chronic pain after surgery. We have chosen to study patients having
      total hip arthroplasty (THA) because chronic pain seems to be a significant problem after
      surgery. We will sample cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prior to injection of the study medication
      for subsequent PGE2 analysis in each patient. We will also assess each patient at 48 hours
      after their surgery for hypersensitivity at their surgical site.
