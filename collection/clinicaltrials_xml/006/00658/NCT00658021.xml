  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that glycemic control, as
      measured by change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to endpoint, with exenatide is
      superior to that of placebo after 28 weeks of treatment in adolescent patients with type 2
      diabetes who are naïve to antidiabetes agents, or patients who are being treated with
      metformin, an SU, or a combination of metformin and an SU.

          -  are a male or a female between ages 10 to 17 years, inclusive. The number of patients
             ≥17 years of age will be limited to no more than 10% of patients in each treatment
             arm

          -  have a history of type 2 diabetes with the original diagnosis based on at least one
             American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria

          -  have been treated with metformin, an SU, or both metformin and an SU (with or without

          -  have used oral steroids within the last 60 days or more than 20 days use within the
             past year

          -  have used any weight loss medication(s) within 30 days of screening

          -  have used insulin for more than 10 weeks during the 3 months prior to screening

          -  have history of renal disease, or serum creatinine &gt;1.6 mg/dL (141.4 µmol/L) (males)
