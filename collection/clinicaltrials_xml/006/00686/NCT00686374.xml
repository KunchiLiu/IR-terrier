             Week 52.

          -  Subject must be a responder at any time point during the M06-806 study.

          -  If female, subjects who are sexually active and are of child-bearing potential should
             be practicing an approved method of birth control throughout the study and for 150
             days after study drug administration. Examples of approved methods of birth control
             include the following:

               1. Condoms, sponge, foam, jellies, diaphragm or intrauterine device (IUD)

               2. Oral, parenteral or intravaginal contraceptives

               3. A vasectomized partner

          -  Subject of legal age, parent or legal guardian, as required, has voluntarily signed
             and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
             approved informed consent form, after the nature of the study has been explained and
             the subject of legal age, subject's parent, or legal guardian, as required, has had
             the opportunity to ask questions. Subjects will be included in all discussions, and
             if required, their signature on an assent form will be obtained.

          -  Parent or legal guardian of subject who is not of legal age, as required, must be
             willing to actively supervise storage and administration of study drug and to ensure
             that the time of each dose is accurately recorded in the subject's diary.

          -  If a subject of legal age, must be willing to actively store, administer, and
             accurately record study drug administration in the subject diary.

          -  Subject is judged to be in acceptable medical condition, as determined by the
             Principal Investigator based upon results of clinical and laboratory evaluations done
             throughout the preceding Crohn's disease study M06-806.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For any reason, the subject is considered by the Investigator to be an unsuitable
             candidate for continuing therapy in the M06-807 study.

          -  Subject has abnormal laboratory or other test results that in the opinion of the
             Investigator will make the subject unsuitable to participate in this study.

          -  History of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease other than a successfully and
             completely treated cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma −
             in-situ of the cervix.

          -  History of listeriosis, histoplasmosis, chronic or active hepatitis B infection,
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, any immunodeficiency syndrome, central
             nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease or active TB (receiving treatment or not
             receiving treatment). Ongoing severe infections such as sepsis and opportunistic
             infections will be exclusionary.

          -  Subject with known, symptomatic obstructive strictures.

          -  Subject who is planning surgical bowel resection at any time point while enrolled in
             the study.

          -  Subject with a history of clinically significant drug or alcohol abuse in the last
             year.

          -  Subject with a poorly controlled medical condition such as: uncontrolled diabetes,
             recurrent infections, unstable ischemic heart disease, moderate to severe heart
             failure, recent cerebrovascular accidents or any other condition which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator or the Sponsor, will put the subject at risk by
             participation in the protocol.

          -  Subject with any prior exposure to Tysabri (natalizumab).

          -  Subject with a known hypersensitivity to the excipients of adalimumab as stated in
             the label.

          -  Subject with a previous history of dysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract.
