      The purpose of this study is to determine if women with chest pain and &quot;clean&quot; heart blood
      vessels have impaired blood flow to the heart due to problems with the small blood vessels
      that provide blood and oxygen to the heart. Impairment in the small blood vessels will be
      tested using ultrasound pictures of the heart, called myocardial contrast echocardiography.
      Since these small blood vessels are not seen in a coronary angiogram, which is an x-ray of
      the heart vessels using a dye containing iodine injected in the heart vessels, the problem
      may remain undiagnosed in women until the heart muscle becomes severely damaged.

      A second purpose is to identify if there is a common trait in the population of women with
      this tiny blood vessel dysfunction, which will be investigated by checking blood levels of
      certain chemical and hormones related to heart disease. Finally, we would like to
      investigate the relationship between depression and stress, and heart disease. We will do
      this by measuring cortisol (a hormone that serves as a measure of stress) and administering
      questionnaires that help to identify depression and stress.

        Fifty non-smoking women, between 45 and 75 years of age, with chest pain will be referred
        to this study by clinicians at OHSU. The control group will be fifty non-smoking women
        with no cardiac symptoms, matched with the study group by age and risk factors. Flyers and
        other advertisements may be used to recruit both the study group and the control group.
        Criteria for exclusion from the study are pregnancy, allergy to any component in the drugs
        used in the study, severe asthma, known disease of the heart vessels or heart valves,
        active infection, cancer, uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease and current smoking
        status.
