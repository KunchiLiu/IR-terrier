      The purpose of the study proposed is to investigate the role of neurosteroids and GABA in
      the pathophysiology and treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) by 1) measuring
      cortical gama-aminobutyric acid levels (GABA levels) using nuclear magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS) during the follicular and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle pre
      and post treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine
      (Prozac®, Sarafem®), and 2) correlating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma GABA and
      neurosteroid levels with cortical GABA levels at these same time points. Neurosteroids to be
      measured include allopregnanolone, pregnenolone, and pregnenolone sulfate. Findings from
      women with PMDD will be compared to those of healthy subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 - 45 years old and able to give voluntary written informed consent.

          -  Willing to complete a daily log of mood symptoms for 7 consecutive menstrual cycles:
             two menstrual cycles during the Screening Phase (Phase 1), one menstrual cycle during
             the Testing Phase (Phase 2), and four menstrual cycles during the Medication
             Treatment Phase and Post-Treatment Phase (Phase 3). All subjects who successfully
             complete Phases 1 and 2, and the Medication Treatment Phase, will be invited to
             participate in Phase 3 approximately three months later. Phase 3 will involve
             repeating all procedures conducted in Phase 2, including the daily log of mood
             symptoms.

          -  Meet DSM-IV criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder, confirmed by the Daily
             Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP; Endicott &amp; Harrison) for 2 consecutive
             menstrual cycles (Phase 1). The DRSP is a self-rated symptom checklist, which
             requires individuals to rate their symptoms of PMDD according to the DSM-IV research
             criteria scale on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 6 (symptom extreme). During
             the last 7 days of the menstrual cycle compared to days 5-11, patients must have a
             30% increase in their average (over 2 menstrual cycles) score for 5 of these 10
             symptoms. Symptoms must be &quot;not present&quot; or &quot;minimal&quot; during the postmenstrual week.

          -  Average 19-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores &lt; 5 during the
             follicular phase and &gt; 16 during the luteal phase.

          -  Have regular menstrual cycles 28 to 32 days in length. Each of the screening cycles
             must be ovulatory as confirmed by plasma progesterone levels of &gt;5 ng/ml during the
             luteal phase.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of any other comorbid DSM-IV Axis I disorder.

          -  Meeting DSM-IV criteria for psychoactive substance (excluding nicotine) dependence
             within the preceding 4 months.

          -  A history of serious medical or neurological illness, including (but not limited to)
             major cardiovascular disease, severe hypertension, intracranial mass lesions, seizure
             disorder, severe hepatic or renal disease, unstable endocrine or metabolic disease,
             and unstable hematologic disease.

          -  Use of anticonvulsant or benzodiazepines within the last month.

          -  Use of psychotropic medication in last week (except as stated above).

          -  Use of steroid contraceptives within the previous 4 months, including birth control
             pill, birth control patch, birth control ring, and Depo-Provera®. Subjects will be
             asked to use abstinence or the barrier method (condoms) as forms of contraception in
             this study.

          -  Alcohol consumption greater than 7 drinks/week.

          -  Current pregnancy.

          -  Metallic implants.
