      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a vaccine based on outer membrane vesicles
      (NOMV) from genetically detoxified group B meningococcus is safe and effective for use as a
      vaccine. If so, the NOMV in this vaccine will be combined with NOMV from two other
      genetically modified strains as a potentially globally effective vaccine against group B
      meningococcus.

          -  Females must have a negative urine pregnancy test on vaccination day before each dose
             AND agree to practice an effective birth control method as necessary, for 6 months

          -  History of allergy to any vaccine;

          -  History of allergy to aluminum hydroxide;

          -  Presence of significant unexplained laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the
             PI may potentially confound the analysis of the study results;

          -  HIV seropositive or any other immunosuppressive state;

          -  Positive test for HBsAg or hepatitis C antibody;

          -  Evidence or admission of on-going drug or alcohol abuse/dependence;

          -  Intention to leave the area during the study such that the volunteer would miss 1 or
             more study days;

          -  Prior receipt of any group B meningococcal outer membrane protein (OMP) vaccine or a
             vaccine containing meningococcal OMP;

          -  Has received or plans to receive any live vaccine, Investigational New Drug (IND)
             products or significant immunosuppressive therapy* in the 28 days prior to, or any
             inactivated vaccine within 14 days before initial vaccination or throughout the
             study, or received parenteral immunoglobulin or blood products within 3 months of
             study initiation;

                  or ≤ 7 days of oral steroids are in general acceptable, depending on the
                  formulation and condition for which they are prescribed. Inclusion of
                  individuals receiving these medications will be made by the PI on a case by case
                  basis)
