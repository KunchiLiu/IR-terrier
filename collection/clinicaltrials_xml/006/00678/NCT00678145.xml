      Many studies have demonstrated that when people with diabetes are intensively treated with
      insulin in order to maintain their glucose within the normal range, all the complications of
      diabetes can be prevented or delayed. However, such treatment carries a significant risk of
      severe hypoglycemia (excessively low blood glucose levels), which may be life-threatening.
      Thus, ideal treatment with insulin in patients with diabetes can be seen as a double-edged
      sword: intensive treatment will delay the complications but is also associated with an
      increased risk of disabling hypoglycemia. In normal conditions, when hypoglycemia occurs,
      the body responds by secreting a variety of hormones and by activating the autonomous
      nervous system which ultimately will result in increasing the blood glucose to normal
      levels. Patients with diabetes, lose this capacity to effectively respond to hypoglycemia
      and become more susceptible to a fall in plasma glucose. Paradoxically, repeated episodes of
      hypoglycemia—especially in the most vulnerable persons with type 1 who need insulin for
      life--induce a metabolic deterioration that further increases the risk of developing
      hypoglycemia.

      Our proposal focuses on understanding the mechanisms the body uses in order to respond to
      hypoglycemia and on potential tools (medicines) that may be used in order to prevent this
      metabolic deterioration associated with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia.

      Based on previous data generated in our laboratory (and others), we propose that repeated
      episodes of hypoglycemia are associated with a deterioration in the &quot;body sensor&quot; for
      hypoglycemia in diabetes. Moreover, since many studies have shown that such deterioration in
      the response to hypoglycemia can be induced also by exercise (patients with diabetes are at
      greater risk for hypoglycemia after exercise), we propose that exercise (and other stresses)
      affect the hypoglycemia response by endorphin release (endorphins are proteins responsible
      for inhibition of the neuroendocrine response system).

      Developing a method that will decrease the incidence of severe hypoglycemia will result in
      safer control of blood glucose, a decrease in the complications of diabetes, and ultimately
      in a better quality and longer life for many patients with diabetes.

      Severe hypoglycemia (SH) is the major limitation of intensive insulin treatment in type 1
      diabetes (T1DM), and the near-term prospects for perfected insulin therapy without this risk
      are dim. Intensively treated T1DM patients suffer from impaired counterregulation of
      hypoglycemia (HYPO)—ie, HYPO-Associated Autonomic Failure (HAAF) and HYPO unawareness
      (HU)—which enhance their susceptibility to SH. The precise mechanisms of HAAF and HU,
      however, have not been clarified, though multiple redundant control systems are implicated.
      Experimental HYPO and exercise in normal and T1DM subjects reproduce HAAF and HU, providing
      a robust experimental paradigm of these disorders. We have shown that fructose, infused in a
      catalytic dose for modulating glucokinase activity, results in augmentation of the
      counterregulatory responses to HYPO in nondiabetic and in T1DM individuals. We hypothesize
      that an equivalent infusion of fructose will prevent HAAF in nondiabetic and in T1DM
      persons. Furthermore, since both HYPO and exercise are associated with endogenous opioid
      (EO) release, and blocking EO improves HYPO counterregulation, we hypothesize that repeated
      HYPO episodes induce alterations in the modulatory effects of EO on hormonal and glucose
      counterregulation, ultimately leading to HAAF. We also propose that HYPO autoregulation, and
      hepatic glycogen metabolism play important roles in the development of HAAF and HU. The
      specific aims are: 1) to determine the effects of previous modulation of glucokinase
      activity on the counterregulatory hormonal and glucose recovery responses to subsequent HYPO
      in nondiabetic and T1DM subjects, 2) to examine the effects of blocking the inhibitory
      action of endorphins on the central neuroendocrine response system (with naloxone), during
      recurrent HYPO or exercise, on subsequent HYPO counterregulatory responses in nondiabetic
      and T1DM subjects, 3) to analyze the effects of recurrent mild HYPO (autoregulation), on
      subsequent HYPO counterregulation in nondiabetic and in T1DM subjects, and 4) to determine
      the effects of recurrent HYPO on hepatic glycogen content in nondiabetic and T1DM subjects,
      and the effects of normalization of liver glycogen content, by means of insulin and glucose
      administration, on experimental HAAF in T1DM subjects.
