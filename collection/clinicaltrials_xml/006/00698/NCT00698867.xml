      The purpose of this study is to perform a five-year, multi-center prospective evaluation of
      the Discovery™ Elbow System for outcome and durability. Relief of pain and restoration of
      function will determine long-term clinical outcome while durability will be measured by the
      absence of revisions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis and avascular
             necrosis.

          -  Inflammatory arthritis

          -  Revision where other devices or treatments have failed

          -  Correction of functional deformity

          -  Treatment of acute fractures or non-union about the elbow

        Patient Selection factors to be considered include:

          -  Need to obtain pain relief and improve function.

          -  Ability and willingness to follow instructions including control of weight and
             activity levels.

          -  Patients who are able and willing to return for follow-up evaluations.

          -  Patients with a good nutritional state.

          -  Patients with full skeletal maturity.

          -  Patients of all races and gender.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients less than 18 years.

          -  Patients with marked bone loss which would preclude proper fixation of the
             prosthesis.

          -  Metabolic disorders, which may impair bone formation.

          -  Patients who are pregnant.

          -  Patients with an active or suspected infection in or around the elbow or distant foci
             of infections, which may spread to the implant site.

          -  Patients with a highly communicable disease or diseases that may limit follow-up
             (e.g. immuno-compromised conditions, hepatitis, active tuberculosis, neoplastic
             disease, etc.).

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with a rehabilitation program for elbow
             replacement or who indicate difficulty or inability to return for follow-up visits
             prescribed by the study protocol.

          -  Patients who qualify for inclusion in the study, but refuse consent to participate in
             the study.
