      This study will assess whether levels of vitamin D impact the characteristics of a woman's
      breast cancer at diagnosis, and whether a short course of vitamin D in women with low levels
      of vitamin D changes the gene expression of their breast cancers.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women undergoing core needle biopsy for a breast abnormality suspicious for breast
             cancer. Women who have undergone a core needle biopsy demonstrating breast cancer who
             have not yet had any further therapy are also eligible so long as their core needle
             biopsy is available for analysis.

          -  No prior therapy for breast cancer.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of parathyroid disease, hypercalcemia, or kidney stones.

          -  Supplemental vitamin D other than from a standard multiple vitamin or from standard
             formulations of calcium and vitamin D (e.g. calcium citrate with vitamin D) within
             the prior 6 months.

          -  History of renal failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation.

          -  Women who are known to be pregnant or who are nursing. (As vitamin D does not have
             toxicity to the fetus, a negative pregnancy test is not a requirement to participate
             in the study.)

          -  Supplemental calcium greater than 600 mg calcium per day during study.

          -  Patients for who initial treatment of their breast cancer will not be with breast
             conserving surgery or mastectomy.

          -  Patients with locally advanced breast cancer

          -  Patients planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other systemic
             therapy.

          -  Patients planned for preoperative radiation therapy.

          -  Patients with planned surgical therapy of their breast cancer that would not allow
             for at least 10 days of vitamin D intervention.

          -  Any condition potentially interfering with subjects ability to comply with taking
             study medication.

          -  Any medical condition that would potentially interfere with vitamin D absorption,
             such as celiac sprue, ulcerative colitis.

          -  Current participation in another research study that would increase risk to subject,
             in the opinion of the investigators
