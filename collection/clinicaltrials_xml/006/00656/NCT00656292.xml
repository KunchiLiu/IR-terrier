    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to quantify the degree of modulation, if any, in the
      perioperative inflammatory response associated with statins use. Specifically, we
      hypothesize that:

      In a population of patients undergoing elective orthopedic spine surgery, administration of
      a specific statin (Simvastatin, Zocor®, Merck Pharmaceuticals), will be associated with a
      decrease in perioperative inflammatory markers when compared to patients not taking statins

      Previous studies have reported activation of the body's immune system during the
      perioperative period.1 Typically, this &quot;stress response&quot; is limited and goes unnoticed by
      the patient and health care team. However, physiologic insults that occur during major
      surgery may elicit a more pronounced response known as the systemic inflammatory response
      syndrome (SIRS). Such a response is of great clinical consequence, as it is known to
      significantly worsen perioperative morbidity and mortality.1 HMG Co-A Reductase Inhibitors
      (hereafter identified by the common name, &quot;the statins&quot;) are potent inhibitors of
      cholesterol synthesis, and their role in the treatment of atherosclerosis and prevention of
      coronary artery disease is well documented.2-5 Interestingly, data from animal studies have
      shown that statins have unique anti-inflammatory properties that are independent of their
      lipid lowering effects.6 Recently, statin therapy has been associated with a reduced
      incidence of perioperative cardiovascular and neurologic complications in major vascular and
      thoracic surgery patients as well as improved outcomes in patients experiencing acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS).7-13 In all ACS patient populations studied, improvement in outcome
      has been attributed to coronary plaque stabilization, presumably a result of statins
      mitigating the local inflammatory response at the level of the coronary plaque.

      The purpose of this study is to quantify the magnitude of perioperative inflammation during
      major orthopedic spine surgery and determine whether statins alter this systemic physiologic
      response.

    <description>Study groups will receive either statin therapy (simvastatin 40 mg) or placebo two days before surgery -- allowing three doses of simvastatin/placebo before incision -- and these will be continued until patients are either discharged from the hospital or have completed a 3-day postoperative course (6 days of simvastatin therapy), whichever occurs earlier. If patients are unable to take oral medications, the enteral route via nasogastric tube (at our institution, nasogastric tubes are routinely placed for both lumbar and thoracic instrumentation) will be used to deliver either placebo or the statin, as no parenteral form of this drug is currently available</description>
