      The objective of this surveillance is to collect information about 1) adverse drug reaction
      not expected from the LPD (unknown adverse drug reaction), 2) the incidence of adverse drug
      reactions in this surveillance, and 3)factors considered to affect the safety and/or
      efficacy of this drug.

      All the patients whom an investigator prescribes the first SILDENAFIL(Revatio) should be
      registered consecutively until the number of subjects reaches target number in order to
      extract patients enrolled into the investigation at random.
