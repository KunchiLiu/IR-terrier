      The two objectives of this study are:

        -  To increase the 2-year event-free survival from 55%, established with Total Therapy II
           (UARK 98-026), to 75% in myeloma patients with cytogenetic abnormalities, and from 80%,
           established with the Total Therapy II regimen, to 95% in myeloma patients without
           cytogenetic abnormalities.

        -  To determine whether bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone can be safely
           incorporated with transplant 1 into the established pre-transplant regimen of high-dose
           melphalan (used in Total Therapy II) and whether Velcade and gemcitabine can be safely
           added to the transplant 2 high-dose chemotherapy regimen of combination melphalan and
           BCNU.

      This study is targeted towards patients who have been diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma and
      have had no prior autologous or allogeneic transplant. Furthermore, only up to 12 months of
      prior treatment are allowed in this patient population. The study schema consists of one
      round of induction chemotherapy, two transplants, one round of consolidation chemotherapy,
      and two years of maintenance treatment. This study design differs from its historical
      predecessors in the following manner:

        -  In contrast to Total Therapy II and III, which only allow enrollment of patients with
           at most one cycle or one month of treatment prior to enrollment, the proposed study
           allows enrollment of patients with up to 12 months of prior treatment. No statistically
           significant difference in outcome between patients with one or no cycle of preceding
           therapy and those with up to 12 months of prior therapy. This should allow enrollment
           of significantly more myeloma patients.

        -  Induction therapy has been reduced to a single cycle.

        -  Bortezomib and thalidomide have been added to the transplant regimen.

        -  BCNU is added to the second transplant to high dose melphalan.

        -  Gemcitabine is added to the second transplant regimen.

        -  Consolidation treatment has been reduced to a single cycle.

        -  The first year of maintenance is with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone, and
           the second year of maintenance therapy consists of dexamethasone only.

        -  The novel agents thalidomide and bortezomib are not introduced upfront, but only with
           transplantation and maintenance.

          3. Patients must have received no more than 12 months of prior chemotherapy for this
             disease. Patients may have received prior radiotherapy provided approval has been
             obtained by the Principal Investigator.

          9. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
             have signed an IRB-approved informed consent in accordance with institutional and
             federal guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Platelet count &lt; 30 x 109/L, unless myeloma-related.

          7. Patients must not have light chain deposition disease-related renal failure or
             creatinine &gt; 3 mg/dl.

          8. Patients must not have prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the
             patient has not received treatment for one year prior to enrollment. Other cancers
             will only be acceptable if the patient's life expectancy exceeds five years.

          9. Patients must not have significant co-morbid medical conditions or uncontrolled life
             threatening infection.
