  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Building stronger bones during pubertal growth could reduce lifelong fracture risk. This
      project is an 18 month dairy intervention study for overweight and healthy weight 4th-8th
      grade boys and girls. Half of the girls will receive dairy products to add to their habitual
      diet (milk, yogurt, and cheese) to equal three products per day, while the other half will
      remain on their normal diet. All participants will attend four study visits, each 6 months
      apart. At these visits height, weight, bone density and geometry, and fat and lean mass will
      be measured. This study aims to show that meeting calcium requirements by eating dairy
      products builds bigger, stronger bones, and that this effect may be enhanced in overweight
      boys and girls. The effect of the dairy intervention on body fat, lean mass, and weight, as
      well as the mechanisms and predictors of changes in bone mass and size and body composition
      will also be evaluated.
