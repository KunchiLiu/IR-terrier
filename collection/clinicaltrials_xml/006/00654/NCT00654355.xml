      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects age 2-15.

          2. Stable or worsening atopic dermatitis affecting 5% or greater body surface area. Face
             and genital areas can be included in the body surface area determination and
             treatment area.

          3. The ability and willingness to follow all study procedures, attend all scheduled
             visits, and successfully complete the study.

          4. The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent/assent form, which must
             be obtained prior to treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known allergy to tacrolimus or to any component of the formulations.

          2. The use of systemic therapy for atopic dermatitis within the past 4 weeks.

          3. Use of prescription topical therapy for atopic dermatitis (e.g., corticosteroids or
             retinoids) within the past 2 weeks.

          4. Use of any investigational therapy within the past 4 weeks.

          5. Pregnant females, females who are breast feeding, or females of childbearing
             potential who are not practicing an acceptable method of birth control (abstinence,
             birth control pill/patch, barrier with spermicidal jelly, IUD, etc.), as determined
             by the investigator. Acceptable contraception must be used during the entire study. A
             pregnancy test will be performed on females of childbearing potential at baseline and
             at week 4.

          6. Any other condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would put the subject
             at unacceptable risk for participation in the study.
