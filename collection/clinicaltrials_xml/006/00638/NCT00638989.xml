        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent is obtained prior to any study related
             procedure taking place.

          -  Males, aged 19-55 years.

          -  No significant abnormality on clinical examination or medical history (excluding
             atopic skin signs, symptoms and history).

          -  A normal 12-lead ECG (no clinically significant abnormalities).

          -  Clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis results within the laboratory reference
             ranges or deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator (see Section 11.7 of
             the protocol for explanation on tests to be performed).

          -  A negative screen for drugs of abuse and alcohol.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18-30 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  No other clinically significant abnormality on history and clinical examination (see
             also Exclusion Criteria).

          -  Able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any active concomitant disease including psychological disorders.

          -  History of medication that might carry over effects into study.

          -  Previously received monoclonal antibody, or a similar related protein, that might
             sensitize subjects to CAT-354.

          -  Participation in another investigational medicinal product study within three months
             of the start of this study or five half lives of the previously administered
             investigational medicinal product (IMP), whichever is the longer except
             methodological studies in which no IMP was given.

          -  Any acute illness in the two weeks before Day 0 (Visit 2).

          -  Any blood donation or significant loss of blood within 56 days of study initiation or
             plasma donation within 7 days of study initiation.

          -  Subject is a participating Investigator, sub-Investigator, study coordinator, or
             employee of a participating Investigator, or is a first degree relative of the
             aforementioned.

          -  Any factor which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the evaluation
             or safety or be associated with poor adherence to the protocol.

          -  The subject's primary care physician recommends the subject should not take part in
             the study.

          -  Subjects with immunodeficiency disorders

          -  Subjects who have a positive test for, or have been treated for hepatitis B,
             hepatitis C or HIV
