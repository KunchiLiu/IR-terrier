  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study a specific acetabular (hip socket) fracture pattern
      and how its treatment affects the functional, clinical, and x-ray outcomes. There are no
      experimental procedures involved.

      This study will identify a small subset of patients that fall outside the Letournel
      classification system of acetabular fractures. The fracture pattern, its influence on the
      surgical treatment decision making process, and the radiographic and outcomes will be
      detailed. In particular, both-column acetabular fractures with significant posterior
      deformity have been correlated with poor functional outcomes, increased arthritis
      radiographically, and worse prognosis in general. Despite these findings, there has been no
      specific study evaluating these injury patterns to date. We present ten patients with both
      column acetabular fractures and an associated posterior column/wall piece and their clinical
      outcomes in an effort to help guide surgical treatment and offer prognostic guidance.

        The study will include 10 patients who have had column fractures with an associated
        posterior wall fracture or significantly displaced posterior column fracture that required
        a separate approach for reduction and/or fixation of the hip performed at Hershey Medical
        Center by two surgeons, Drs. David Goodspeed and J. Spence Reid over a 12 month period
        (June 2006 - May 2007). There is no control population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients that underwent surgical fixation of the hip at Hershey Medical Center
             between June 2006 and May 2007 by Dr's J. Spence Reid and David Goodspeed.

          -  They will include patients that are admitted directly from the field or are
             transferred from outside hospitals.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  will be those acetabular fractures of non-traumatic etiology (e.g.: secondary to
             malignancy or fatigue)

          -  fractures that have not undergone operative fixation

          -  pediatric populations under the age of 18

          -  mentally compromised patients

          -  those that do not give consent for the clinical evaluation.
