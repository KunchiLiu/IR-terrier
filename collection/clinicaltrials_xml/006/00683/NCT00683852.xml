      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a reduced dose of aripiprazole is
      effective in treating patients with major depressive disorder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 60-day, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the efficacy of
      aripiprazole (Abilify) augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or
      selective serotonin norepinephrine uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) venlafaxine in patients with
      MDD who have responded inadequately to treatment with ADTs. The purpose of our study is to
      evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose (2 mg/day) aripiprazole (Abilify) as an
      augmentation strategy in MDD non-responding to ADT with SSRIs or the SNRI venlafaxine.

          1. Patients able to give informed consent, and/or consent obtained from a legally
             acceptable representative (as required by IRB/IEC), prior to the initiation of any
             protocol required procedures.

          2. Patients must be able to understand the nature of the study, agree to comply with the
             prescribed dosage regimens, report for regularly scheduled office visits, and
             communicate to study personnel about adverse events and concomitant medication use.

          3. Patients with a diagnosis of major depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV-TR
             criteria, based on the SCID-I/P; their major depressive episode must be deemed
             &quot;valid&quot; using the SAFER criteria interview administered by remote, independent
             raters.

          4. Patients who have reported a history for the current depressive episode of an
             inadequate response to at least one and no more than three adequate antidepressant
             treatments. An inadequate response is defined as less than a 50% reduction in
             depressive symptom severity, as assessed by the MGH ATRQ administered by remote,
             independent raters. An adequate trial is defined as an antidepressant treatment for
             at least 6 weeks duration at least at a minimum dose as specified in the MGH ATRQ.

          5. Patients must have a HAM-D17 ≥ 18 at the end of the screening phase to qualify for
             inclusion. The HAM-D17 will be administered by the study clinicians at the screening
             and baseline visits, and by remote, independent raters during the screening phase at
             the time of the SAFER interview.

          6. Patients must be able to be reliably rated on the psychiatric scales required by the
             protocol.

          7. Men and women, ages 18 to 65 Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an
             adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up
             to 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product in such a manner that the
             risk of pregnancy is minimized.

             WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
             bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea ³ 12
             consecutive months; or women on hormone replacement therapy [HRT] with documented
             serum follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level &gt; 35 mIU/mL). Even women who are using
             oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches,
             or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an intrauterine
             device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or
             are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) should
             be considered to be of childbearing potential.

             WOCBP must have a negative urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or
             equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the start of investigational

          8. Meet DSM-IV criteria (by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV - SCID-I/P) for
             MDD, current;

             least 16 at both screen and baseline visits;

         10. Treated with an SSRI at adequate doses (defined as 20mg/day or more of fluoxetine,
             citalopram; paroxetine 30mg/day or more or 37.5 mg/day or more of paroxetine CR; 10
             mg/day or more of escitalopram, 50mg/day or more of sertraline, and 150 mg/day or
             more of venlafaxine) during the current episode for at least 8 weeks, with the same,
             adequate dose over the last 4 weeks;

         11. Between the screen and baseline visit, patients must be documented prospectively to
             have received a stable dose of their SSRI or venlafaxine for at least 2 weeks.

        Additional criteria for defining response and non-response for patients in Phase 2
        eligible for the pooling of the data with all the patients in Phase 1. Among patients
        pre-randomized to receive placebo in both phases or to receive placebo in Phase 1 and
        aripiprazole in phase 2, only those meeting non-response criteria will be added to the
        primary efficacy sample:

          -  Placebo non-responders are defined as those patients who failed to achieve a 50%
             decrease in their MADRS score at visit 3,

          -  Have a MADRS score of &gt; 16 at visit 3

             combination regimens) at a therapeutic dose (as defined by the ATRQ) and for an
             adequate duration (minimum six weeks for any monotherapy).

          7. Patients who report treatment with adjunctive antipsychotic medication with an
             antidepressant for a minimum of two weeks during the current depressive episode.
