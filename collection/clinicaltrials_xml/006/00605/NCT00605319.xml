    <textblock>
      The subjects who have symptoms of overactive bladder (many trips to the bathroom, and
      urgency with or without the inability to hold your urine until you get to the toilet) are
      invited to participate in this research study. Overactive bladder is a common sequelae of
      long-term bladder outlet obstruction in men. Unfortunately, it does not often resolve after
      treatment of the obstruction (transurethral resection of the prostate). These patients are
      usually started empirically on alpha-blockers or occasionally anticholinergic agents, former
      used to treat enlarged prostate medically, and latter, to treat overactive bladder. We
      hypothesize that these patients would be significantly improved with a long-acting
      anticholinergic agent such as long acting Fesoterodine or Toviaz.

      Earlier studies have shown that anticholinergic drugs seem to have a beneficial effect on
      symptoms of patients with bladder outlet obstruction and overactive bladder. In addition,
      anticholinergic drug Toviaz is not associated with increased incidence of complication like
      acute urinary retention, a state where patient is unable to empty the bladder as an adverse
      effect of the drug.

      A large proportion of our patients that are undergoing treatment for bladder outlet
      obstruction also have overactive bladder. We propose an open label trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of Toviaz (fesoterodine) 4mg to 8 mg in patients that have continued symptoms of
      overactive bladder one month following transurethral resection of the prostate. Toviaz is an
      antimuscarinic and anticholinergic agent, and is a newer formulation of Detrol. Patients
      with overactive bladder on urodynamic test preoperatively will be considered. If these
      patients continue to have symptoms at the one-month post-operative visit, they will be
      enrolled into the study. We expect a total of 25 patients to be enrolled within 4 months.
      All patients will receive Toviaz 4mg to 8 mg. The patients will be followed at 3 months
      post-op, 4 months post-op, and 7 months post-op. At each post-op visit, the patients will
      fill out an AUA symptom score questionnaire, have noninvasive uroflowmetry performed, and
      have a post-void residual measured by bladder scan. Using standard statistical analysis, we
      will see if there is a difference in symptoms, post-void residual, or maximum flow rate
      between baseline and 7 months post-op. We will continue the study to evaluate long-term
      efficacy, dropout rate, and complications. An FDA approved flexible dosing regimen will be
      allowed for the duration of the study.

        Patients will be selected by the investigator and sub-investigator's patient population,
        and physician referrals. All patients will meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male â‰¥40 years of age

          2. Clinical signs and symptoms of frequency and urgency, enlarged prostate and
             urodynamic study consistent with overactive bladder.

          3. IPSS &gt;12, with IPSS QoL &gt; 3 at screening visit.

          4. Ability and willingness to correctly complete the micturition diary and all the trial
             related questionnaires comply with scheduled visits and comply with trial procedures.

          5. Capability of understanding and having signed the informed consent form after full
             discussion of the research, nature of the treatment, and its risks and benefits.
