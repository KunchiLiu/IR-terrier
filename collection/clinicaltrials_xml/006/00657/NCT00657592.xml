  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the efficacy, tolerability and
      safety of oral ziprasidone as monotherapy in patients with (major depressive disorder) MDD.
      The study involves the enrollment of a total of 120 patients with MDD over the course of 12
      months across two sites. Outpatients suffering from MDD will be treated with either
      ziprasidone or with placebo for 12 weeks using the sequential parallel comparison design.

      In light of the challenge major depressive disorder (MDD) poses to clinicians and patients
      alike, identifying novel treatments is urgently needed to help further refine the standard
      of care. Judging by their molecular structure and function, the atypical neuroleptic agents
      offer possibilities as effective antidepressants. To date, several studies have been
      reported examining the use of atypical neuroleptic agents as adjunctive therapy (used along
      with an antidepressant) for MDD. These studies go so far as to suggest that atypical
      neuroleptic agents have potential for treating MDD. Until now, atypical neuroleptics have
      been strictly viewed as adjuncts, however, it is quite possible that some of the atypical
      neuroleptic agents may possess antidepressant properties when used as the lone therapy.

      The atypical neuroleptic agent ziprasidone, in particular, is an excellent neuroleptic
      candidate for studying antipsychotic effects on MDD for two principal reasons: its structure
      makes it favorable for binding to neurotransmitters in the brain and it has fewer
      side-effects compared to the other drugs in its class. This study will be the first, double
      blind, placebo-controlled trial of ziprasidone as monotherapy for MDD. If safe and effective
      as an antidepressant, ziprasidone would represent an additional option for patients with
      MDD.

      Potential subjects will be approached during a regularly scheduled clinic visit, upon
      referral from another physician, or in response to research advertisements. Interested
      individuals will have the opportunity to review the consent form with family, friends, and
      other physicians prior to making a final decision regarding study enrollment. Once the
      subject has given informed consent, the screening process for the study will commence.

      Subjects will have a screening visit to determine eligibility. The screening visit consists
      of a medical evaluation, completion of psychological rating scales, physical/neurological
      exams, electrocardiogram, and the collection of blood and urine. After subjects pass
      screening, they will be randomized into one of 3 study groups. Subjects will receive either
      12 weeks of ziprasidone, 12 weeks of placebo, or 6 weeks of placebo followed by 6 weeks of
      ziprasidone. Study participants will have a 5 in 8 chance of receiving ziprasidone at some
      point in the study.

      Subjects will be closely monitored during the study via 2 phone calls weekly from the study
      coordinator. The overall safety of the study will also be well scrutinized. The
      investigators shall identify an independent physician safety monitor, who will be without
      any affiliation to this study. He/she will be provided all the information necessary to
      evaluate the study's safety parameters and whether or not they are effective preventative
      measures.

      Various psychological assessments will be completed by research subjects at every study
      visit.

      This research study is designed to test the safety and/or effectiveness of the
      investigational use of the drug Ziprasidone that has been approved by the U.S Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). While the drug used in the study is FDA-approved for treating
      schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder I, it is not yet approved for alleviating solely the
      symptoms of depression.

    <description>The first research study group will receive oral Ziprasidone for Phases 1 and 2.
If you are randomized to group 1, during Phase 1, you will receive one pill (20 mg) of Ziprasidone to be taken twice-a-day. This dose will be increased by 1 pill (20 mg) twice-a-day each week for 6 weeks, if well tolerated, to a maximum of 4 pills (80 mg) taken twice daily.
During Phase 2, you will receive the same dose and frequency of Ziprasidone as administered during Phase 1. If you had not reached the maximum dose of 4 pills taken twice daily, your dosage will continue to be increased (if tolerated) each week by 1 pill taken twice daily until you reach the maximum dosage level.</description>
