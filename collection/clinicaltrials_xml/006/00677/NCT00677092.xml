    <textblock>
      Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a recently described, extremely debilitating and
      painful condition that affects individuals with renal failure. Recent reports suggest an
      association between gadolinium exposure during magnetic resonance (MR) studies and the
      subsequent development of NSF in patients with chronic renal failure. NSF is characterized
      by rapidly progressive skin hardening, tethering and hyperpigmentation, predominantly on the
      extremities. Visceral involvement is rare. Skin biopsies of early NSF lesions demonstrate
      thickened collagen bundles, mucin deposition, angiogenesis and numerous dermal spindle cells
      that stain with antibodies to CD34 and procollagen. Cutaneous changes of NSF are present in
      up to 13% of individuals receiving hemodialysis. Among those patients with clinical evidence
      of NSF, the principle investigator of this protocol has recently reported that NSF is
      associated with increased early mortality at 24-months.

      There is no proven therapy for this devastating disorder. Anecdotal reports have shown
      modest improvement in joint mobility and decreased skin thickening with extracorporeal
      photopheresis and pentoxyphylline.

      Increased TGF-beta1 mRNA on immunostaining has been observed in skin, fascia and striated
      muscle. Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, prevents TGF-beta-induced
      stimulation of collagen and extracellular matrix protein synthesis as well as mRNA
      expression by normal fibroblasts. This observation led the principal investigator to
      evaluate imatinib mesylate 400 mg p.o. daily for 1 year in two patients with NSF. The result
      was significant softening of previously hardened skin with increased mobility of skin that
      previously had been tethered to the underlying fascia. After one month of imatinib mesylate,
      one of the two patients had a 20 degree reduction of his knee flexion contractures.
