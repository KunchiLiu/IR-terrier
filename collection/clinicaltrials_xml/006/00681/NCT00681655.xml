    <textblock>
      This study will study the presence of a particular form of a gene, GABRA2, to characterize
      functional responses of the human brain to alcohol administration and will evaluate that
      relationship in the context of factors known to increase the risk for future alcoholism.

    <description>Each subject will complete a total of 4 2.8 hr-long clamping sessions, conducted as two pairs of infusion sessions.Within each session, procedures differed only by the content of the infusate during the two clamping session. In one admission (AA), both sessions infused 6% ethanol; in the other (PA), the 1st session (always 1st) infused only the vehicle, quantifying the placebo response for every subject. The 2nd session of the PA was always another alcohol clamp.</description>
