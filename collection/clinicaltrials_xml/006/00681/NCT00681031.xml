      Primary objective:

      To demonstrate whether or not ZOSTAVAX® at minimum release specification approaching expiry
      potency elicits an acceptable Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) antibody fold rise (measured by
      gpELISA) from pre-vaccination to 4 weeks post-vaccination

      Secondary objectives:

      To describe the safety profile of ZOSTAVAX® at minimum release specification approaching
      expiry potency
