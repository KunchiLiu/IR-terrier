    <textblock>
      The combination of high blood pressure and having central obesity is an increasing important
      factor for heart disease in men and women. It can also lead to the early development of
      hardening of the arteries and increased risk of a stroke. This study will analyze patients'
      genetic make up to identify who may be at greater risk for heart disease and strokes in
      relationship to high blood pressure and central obesity.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is an increasingly important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in men and women
      and is associated with the premature development of atherosclerosis, and increased risk of
      stroke. A classical perspective of cardiovascular risk does not adequately explain all of
      the cardiovascular events associated with obesity. Elevated plasma levels of plasminogen
      activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) are one of the biochemical hallmarks for obesity and
      likely contribute the increased risk of atherothrombotic events in patients with obesity.
      The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the increased risk of atherothrombotic
      events in patients with obesity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that vascular
      PAI-1 excess promotes the development of intravascular thrombosis. We will test the
      hypothesis that secreted factors from adipocytes have autocrine, paracrine and endocrine
      effects that have a deleterious effect on the fibrinolytic system, either by enhancing PAI-1
      production or impairing endothelial t-PA release. From a public health perspective, there is
      no greater threat to America's cardiovascular health than the epidemic of obesity. It is
      anticipated that this study will provide new insights nto the molecular mechanisms that
      contribute to the development of fibrinolytic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease in
      obesity.
