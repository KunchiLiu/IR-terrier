  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the tolerability and efficacy of N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)
      in children with Autism. NAC is a compound that increases the levels of Glutathione, the
      body's main antioxidant. Glutathione is a compound in the blood that is part of a natural
      defense system (the antioxidant system). Anti-oxidants protect the body from damage caused
      by internal toxins called &quot;free radicals.&quot; It is possible that children with Autism tend to
      have lower levels of glutathione, an important compound in our bodies that helps combat the
      effects of toxic free radicals.

      We hope that by studying the antioxidant system in more detail, we will increase our
      understanding of the reasons why people develop Autism so that we can design better ways to
      treat individuals with this condition. This study is meant to test the safety tolerability
      of NAC and its effectiveness in the treatment of behavioral difficulties in children with
      autism. It will also examine the possible benefit of this agent in improving the core
      deficits in autism such as social deficits.
