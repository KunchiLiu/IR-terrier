  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether employment-based naltrexone treatment
      proves effective in promoting depot naltrexone adherence and drug abstinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized study is planned over 5 years to evaluate the effectiveness of the Therapeutic
      Workplace in promoting naltrexone adherence in opiate-dependent adults. An extended-release
      depot formulation of naltrexone will be used. Participants will be offered an inpatient
      opioid detoxification and naltrexone induction. Participants who complete the oral
      naltrexone induction (N=80) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Both groups will
      be invited to work in the Therapeutic Workplace and will be prescribed depot naltrexone for
      6 months. Patients in the &quot;Work Plus Naltrexone Contingency&quot; condition will earn access to
      working and earning salary by taking depot naltrexone once per month. &quot;Work Plus Naltrexone
      Prescription&quot; participants will be encouraged to take depot naltrexone monthly, but access
      to working and earning salary will not be contingent on doing so.
