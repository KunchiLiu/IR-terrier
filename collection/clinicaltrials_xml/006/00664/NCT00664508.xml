  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Much research has shown that patients are generally satisfied with pain relief in the months
      and years following a total hip replacement (THR) or hip resurfacing procedure. However,
      many express dissatisfaction with their ability to perform daily activities, a reduced
      walking ability and long-term lower extremity muscle weakness. Given the general lack of
      knowledge surrounding joint motion of the lower extremities in the THR population, there is
      a need to characterize the joint mechanics of people having undergone THR, so that
      interventions and rehabilitation strategies can be designed to reduce post-operative
      complications and improve mobility.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  15 patients between the ages of 50 and 75 yrs having undergone a primary total hip
             replacement or hip resurfacing within 6 to 18 months of the study will participate,
             as well as an equal number of age, sex, height and weight matched healthy control
             participants.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential participants for the control group will be asked if they have had previous
             lower limb ailments or surgery, and if they have they will be excluded. Moreover, the
             THR participants cannot have had secondary hip replacement due to infection, revision
             surgery, or a concomitant surgical procedure (i.e., graft). Participants from both
             groups cannot have had any medical conditions which could affect physical movement
             such as a stroke.
