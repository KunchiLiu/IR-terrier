  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a rapidly progressive lung disorder that is often
      associated with a chronic, intractable cough. The etiology of the cough associated with IPF
      is unclear but it is often so severe that it adversely effects the patient's quality of
      life. We propose that thalidomide specifically suppresses the cough associated with
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis via its anti-inflammatory properties, by suppressing the
      excessive functional up-regulation of sensory fibers with in the respiratory tract of
      patients with IPF.

      This study is a Phase III, double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover trial
      testing the efficacy of thalidomide in suppressing the chronic cough of IPF. The primary
      objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of thalidomide administered daily for
      12 weeks to suppress the chronic cough in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as
      measured by cough specific questionnaires, scales and improved quality of life.

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase III, double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover trial
      testing the efficacy of thalidomide in suppressing the chronic cough of IPF. All subjects
      will be randomized to either begin the study receiving the active study drug - (thalidomide)
      or inactive drug (placebo). Study drug will be administered in escalating dose starting at
      50 mg a day increasing to 100 mg a day if cough is still present after 2 weeks. Study drug
      will be taken by mouth at bedtime. Patients will remain on their initial treatment for 12
      weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment, the subjects will be administered the Cough Specific
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ), a visual cough analogue scale, and St. Georges
      Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). In addition, investigators will collect the subjects cough
      diary. After 12 weeks of treatment all subjects will enter a 2 week wash-out phase in which
      all drugs will be discontinued. After the 2 week wash-out phase, all subjects will again be
      administered the Cough Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ), a visual cough
      analogue scale, and St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). In addition, investigators
      will collect the subjects cough diary. All subjects will then be crossed over to the other
      treatment arm for an additional 12 weeks of treatment. After the second 12 weeks of
      treatment, the subjects will be administered the Cough Specific Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (CQLQ), a visual cough analogue scale, and St. Georges Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ). In addition, investigators will collect the subjects cough diary.
