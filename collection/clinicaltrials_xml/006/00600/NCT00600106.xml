      For the purposes of this study, as a core lab coordinating center, the investigators will be
      performing P31 MRS core lab analyses; hormone core lab analyses; lipid core lab analyses;
      glucose, insulin and HOMA core lab analyses; exercise stress test/Holter monitor core lab
      analyses; brachial artery reactivity test core lab analyses; full study data analyses for
      manuscript preparation and the writing and submission and publication of manuscript.

      Numerous unexpected events occurred during the course of this study led to incomplete and
      underpowered results.

      Recruitment was closed prematurely due to failure to recruit following publication of the
      Women's Health Initiative hormone trial. No conclusions could be drawn due to the power
      limitation.

      We lost the P31 MR Spectroscopy core lab when WISE MR expert investigators moved to new
      institutions from the WISE MR CORE site (at UAB from 1996 to 2001). The planned P31tests
      could not be completed with the same protocols used for the initial phase of the WISE.

      Initial WISE cohort brachial artery FMD data showed large variability and FMD was only
      weakly associated with presence of CAD (Am Heart J 2002; 802-807). Also in WISE women FMD
      failed to correlate with directly measured coronary artery endothelial dysfunction in
      response to intracoronary acetylcholine. So enthusiasm for FMD testing waned among the WISE
      investigators. No conclusions could be drawn due to the power limitations.

      We observed that only about 50% of WISE women in the initial cohort could perform the
      modified ACIP protocol (used in this substudy for ETT) and even when we excluded
      nondiagnostic studies the respective sensitivities and specificities were only 43 and 66%
      (Am Heart J 2005;149;527-533). So only 16 and 17 women from the placebo and FemHRT groups,
      respectively, completed ETTs at 16 weeks among the 37 randomized and the majority of these
      were &quot;indeterminate&quot;. Exercise duration, was specified as a secondary outcome measure. No
      conclusions could be drawn due to the power limitations.
