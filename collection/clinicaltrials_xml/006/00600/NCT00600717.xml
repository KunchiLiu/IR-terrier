      The objective of this study is to characterize the normal neuromagnetic profile of
      sensorimotor, auditory, visual, and language cortices in children and adults using
      magnetoencephalography (MEG). We hope to build the world's first high-frequency MEG data for
      the developing brain. High-frequency neuromagnetic signals are associated with
      high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), ripple, fast ripple or high-gamma activation in the
      brain.

      MEG is a new powerful tool for noninvasively measuring neuromagnetic signals originating
      from the brain. Since MEG can detect neuromagnetic signals with high spatial and temporal
      resolution, many brain properties can be studied. For pediatric purposes, MEG can (1)
      evaluate the functionalities of the sensorimotor, auditory, visual, and language systems
      non-invasively during normal maturation; (2) identify abnormalities in these functionalities
      that occur with neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders; and (3) provide a
      pre-operative &quot;functional map&quot; for neurosurgeons to improve surgical outcomes and decrease
      morbidity and mortality.

      Previously MEG has been used to provide a single three-dimensional point that estimates the
      'center' of cortical regions [1,2]. In this study three new techniques will be used to
      extend the usefulness of MEG beyond this point-like estimate of a cortical primary sensory
      input or motor output region. The three new techniques are independent component analysis,
      S-transform, and magnetic spatial filtering. The three new techniques for data analysis will
      be used in conjunction with non-invasive MEG data collection. The three techniques will
      provide us with the following important information about the brain: (1) the patterns of
      synchronization and de-synchronization of evoked cortical activation and (2) the volumetric
      extent of these active sensorimotor, auditory, visual and language cortices in children and
      adults. This approach may lead to a new way to study the brain functions in normal children
      and in children with various brain disorders.

      I. PURPOSE OF STUDY The purpose of this study is to characterize neuromagnetic activation in
      0-3,000 Hz in normal children and adults using our state of the art MEG system. MEG is an
      instrument that allows for quantitative measurement of brain function with very high
      temporal and spatial resolution (see Appendix A). Conventional MEG data analysis methods
      focus on the magnetic signal in the time domain. In order to extend the usefulness of MEG,
      we will use three advanced signal-processing techniques to focus on the magnetic signal in
      the frequency domain. Our MEG system combined with the three advanced signal-processing
      techniques may open new windows to understanding development of the brain.

      Specifically, we propose to study sensorimotor, auditory, visual and language evoked
      magnetic fields in normal children. Since the maturation of the brain may be associated with
      changes in the neuromagnetic signals generated in the sensorimotor, auditory, visual and
      language systems, one group of adults will be included to clarify the maturational changes.
      The normative data of the proposed study would be essential for identification of the
      abnormalities of the brain in various disorders; such data will be the foundation for
      development of clinical applications in children with MEG. The following aims and
      exploratory hypothesis will be probed:

      Specific Aim 1. To characterize the evoked sensorimotor, auditory, visual and language
      evoked magnetic responses The working hypothesis for this aim is that at least one magnetic
      response will be identified in the averaged magnetic waveforms following sensorimotor,
      auditory, visual and language stimulation. The latency and amplitude of the evoked magnetic
      responses can be quantitatively measured and normal, age-adjusted ranges determined.
      Statistical comparisons between children and adults and across pediatric age ranges will be
      performed. Furthermore, we will characterize the neuromagnetic activation in each subgroup
      in children to estimate the maturational changes of the brain.

      The hypotheses for this aim are all exploratory, as our intent is to gather normative data.
      The following are hypotheses with which we will probe our data:

        1. The neuromagnetic responses evoked by sensorimotor, auditory and visual stimulation be
           simple patterns.

        2. The neuromagnetic responses evoked by language stimulation would be a complex pattern.

        3. Among the four modalities, for latencies and amplitudes, sensorimotor evoked magnetic
           response will have the smallest coefficient of variation and language evoked responses
           will have the largest.

      We have the hardware, software, techniques and skills to quantitatively measure and
      statistically compare the evoked magnetic responses. The MEG results in normal children will
      provide a foundation for future studies in diseased populations of children.

      Specific Aim 2. To volumetrically localize the neuromagnetic spectral distributions evoked
      by sensorimotor, auditory, visual and language stimulation The working hypothesis for this
      aim is that the three-dimensional distribution of neuromagnetic spectral power can reveal
      the focal changes around sensorimotor, auditory, visual and language cortices in children.
      The development of the multichannel MEG system makes it possible to simultaneously record
      the neuromagnetic activation of the entire cortex. The newest magnetic signal processing
      techniques have the ability to reconstruct the three-dimensional neuromagnetic activation
      (see Appendix A, Figure 6, for an example). The frequency-spectral profile can provide novel
      information about the specific neural activation patterns in eloquent cortex. This
      exploratory aim will use the same data recorded for Specific Aim 1.

      The hypotheses for this aim are:

        1. Each eloquent brain area (sensorimotor, auditory, visual and language cortex) may be
           associated with one or more specific frequency bands. The spectral power of certain
           frequency bands may increase at specific brain areas.

        2. High frequency oscillation can be identified in all the four modalities; however, the
           three-dimensional distributions of the high frequency oscillation are different across
           the modalities. The high frequency components may be identified before the conventional
           magnetic responses.

        3. Synchronization and de-synchronization can be observed in sensorimotor, auditory,
           visual and language systems. However, the frequency bands and regions are different
           among the four modalities.

      The three techniques can measure in a reliable, non-biased, and quantitative magnetic
      manner, signals in the frequency domain. Since conventional MEG data analysis methods focus
      on magnetic signal in the time domain, the present study can provide a novel neuromagnetic
      profile of the brain in children. The new objective neuromagnetic parameters will enable us
      to quantitatively evaluate the brain function and maturation in normal children and possibly
      in children with brain disorders in the future.

      Specific Aim 3. To quantitatively estimate neuromagnetic maturational changes in
      sensorimotor, auditory, visual and language systems in children The working hypothesis for
      this aim is that MEG combined with the three new signal processing techniques can reveal the
      maturational change of sensorimotor, auditory, visual and language systems in children. The
      proposed research focuses on children. We will recruit one group of adults as a reference,
      so that we can differentiate the neuromagnetic maturational change from inter-individual
      variation. Since most of the previous MEG reports [3,4] on functional brain mapping focus on
      adults, the MEG data from the adult group also allow us to compare our results with the
      results from other MEG sites. With the three new signal-processing techniques as well as the
      conventional methods, this study will provide quantitative data to estimate the maturational
      changes of the brain. This exploratory aim will use the same data recorded for Specific Aims
      1 and 2.

      The hypotheses for this aim are:

        1. In normal children, sensorimotor, auditory, visual evoked magnetic responses change
           linearly with age. However, language evoked magnetic responses may change nonlinearly
           due to the development of lateralization.

        2. The neuromagnetic differences between girls and boys may be observed in auditory,
           visual and language systems. However, this phenomenon may be only observable over
           certain ages.

        3. The maturational changes of the brain may be associated with frequency changes in
           normal children. The development of the brain in childhood through adulthood can be
           then quantitatively monitored using MEG.

      Once we complete the studies for specific aim 1 and aim 2, we will address this aim. We
      consider that this aim can be directly addressed because we will have all the data, analysis
      software and hardware available. The maturational neuromagnetic results will enable us to
      objectively evaluate the brain function in various age groups. We consider that the results
      will contribute to the clinical management of children with developmental brain disorders.

      II. SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY IN RELATION TO HUMAN HEALTH Many disorders of cerebral function
      are associated with abnormal patterns of brain activity, which can be assessed using
      neurophysiology. Neurophysiologic measures can thus provide insight into the underlying
      biology of both normal and diseased brain.

      MEG is an evolving, noninvasive technology which allows for very precise spatial and
      temporal measurements of neurophysiological function (see Appendix A). MEG measures very
      weak magnetic fields originating from the human brain [5]. Its time resolution is under 1
      millisecond, significantly shorter than that of functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI), and its spatial discrimination is 2-3 mm for sources in the cerebral cortex, much
      better than electroencephalography (EEG) [6,7]. MEG provides unique neurophysiologic data
      not obtainable by other neuroimaging techniques. The three advanced signal-processing
      methods can reveal aspects of neuronal function that previously could not be obtained by
      conventional MEG data analysis methods, such as averaging or dipole modeling.

      We propose to use these MEG signal-processing techniques to characterize the normal
      neuromagnetic profile of children. Recent changes in the software which we employ in this
      study do not pose any additional risk to study participants. This study focuses on
      functional brain mapping using MEG in normal children. These maps will then be available for
      comparison to children with epilepsy and other neurological disorders.

      For clinical purposes, there are at least two very valuable roles for MEG, functional
      mapping and determination of the locations of epileptic foci [3,4]. Neurosurgeons frequently
      face the dilemma of deciding whether operating to remove an epileptogenic region will cause
      greater harm than the pathology itself. This dilemma is greatest when there is reason to
      believe that the eloquent cortex involved is critical to either motor skills or speech
      skills. MEG can solve this problem by localizing critical brain regions and providing a
      &quot;brain map&quot; to guide the surgeons [3,4]. The &quot;brain map&quot; is also called magnetic source
      imaging (MSI). MSI is a combination of functional data derived from MEG recording
      co-registered with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MSI shows the anatomical
      location of the functional brain activity.

      Functional brain mapping for children with intractable epilepsy is necessary to reduce
      surgical morbidity and has broad clinical applicability for several reasons. First, the
      prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of childhood epilepsy are high, and seizures in about
      40% of patients cannot be controlled adequately by medication alone. In these patients,
      surgical treatment must be considered. Second, the spectrum of prenatally and postnatally
      acquired lesions in children with intractable seizures often creates difficulty in
      localization of epileptic regions using conventional EEG. Third, epileptogenic tissue is
      commonly not distinguishable from normal cortex in the operating room, making surgery guided
      by simple intraoperative visual inspection problematic and accurate pre-surgical anatomic
      localization critical. Fourth, the standard additional approach to intraoperative
      localization, which is electrocorticography (ECoG), is more invasive and risky. To record
      ECoG, the electrodes have to be placed directly on the brain. Disadvantages of the current
      approach include need for a craniotomy, risks of surgical complications like infection and
      intracerebral hemorrhage, and time delays during the operative procedure itself. In
      contrast, MEG is a non-invasive outpatient procedure. It reduces risk, time and expense for
      the patients.

      In summary, the outcome of the proposed research will be significant. First of all, the
      normal MEG data obtained in this study will be the basis for identification of the
      abnormalities in various brain disorders in children. Second, the three new
      signal-processing methods can open new windows to understanding the brain function. Third,
      gaining greater experience with data acquisition and statistical analysis with this
      relatively new clinical tool will help us establish standardized routines for clinical
      applications. Moreover, the results of the present study can be directly transferred to
      epilepsy surgery to produce improved surgical outcomes.
