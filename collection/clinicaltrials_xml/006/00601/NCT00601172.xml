    <textblock>
      This a Phase III trial designed to determine if IV casopitant plus dexamethasone and
      ondansetron is more effective in the prevention of vomiting and nausea then dexamethasone
      and ondansetrone alone following the administration of moderately emetogenic
      oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.

                       pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal. For purposes of this
                       study, postmenopausal is defined as one year without menses)

                    2. child-bearing potential: must have a negative serum pregnancy test result
                       or negative urine dipstick pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the

             diaphragm;

          -  intra-uterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year;

             any uncontrolled medical condition (other than malignancy) which in the opinion of
             the Investigator may confound the results of the study, represent another potential
             etiology for emesis and nausea (other than CINV) or pose an unwarranted risk to the
             subject.

             investigational product, or is scheduled to receive any investigational drug other
             than casopitant/placebo during the study period.
