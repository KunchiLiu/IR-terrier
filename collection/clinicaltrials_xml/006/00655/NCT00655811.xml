      The purpose of this research is to study how people respond differently to capsaicin in
      different racial groups and the effect it has on your pain levels. Capsaicin is a natural
      product made from hot chili peppers that is useful for treating the itch symptoms of skin
      disease.

          -  Subjects must be in general good health with no skin disease, disease state or
             physical condition which would impair evaluation of pain perception or which would
             increase their health risk by study participation as determined by the investigators.

          -  Women of childbearing potential will be required to have a negative pregnancy test in
             order to enroll in the study.

          -  Diagnosis of diseases that would affect the measurement of pain perception.

          -  Currently enrolled in any investigational study in which the subject is receiving any
             type of drug, biologic, or non-drug therapy and subjects undergoing treatment with
             another investigational drug or approved therapy for investigational use within 30
             days prior to study participation.

          -  Use of oral analgesic or other medications known to interfere with pain perception in
             the week prior to the study.
