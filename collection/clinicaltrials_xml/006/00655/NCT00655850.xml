  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the overall progression-free survival (PFS) in
      patients with advanced or metastatic (Stage IIIB - pleural effusion/IV), non-squamous
      histology NSCLC treated with metronomic chemotherapy plus Avastin. Also, currently there are
      no defined markers that predict for clinical benefit to Avastin. Preliminary studies show
      that there are several observations that support the concept of metronomic chemotherapy with
      or without the combination of an anti-angiogenic agent. The metronomic chemotherapy with
      Avastin was shown to enhance the clinical endpoints of the study (response rate and
      progressive-free survival). Proof of metronomic scheduling requires the development of
      appropriate intermediate surrogate markers. Several markers will be assessed.

    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, pilot Phase II study of metronomic chemotherapy plus
      Avastin in chemo naïve subjects with advanced non-squamous, non-small cell carcinoma of the
      lung. The primary endpoint of this study is to assess the overall progression-free survival.

      Subjects will be treated with metronomic chemotherapy with paclitaxel and gemcitabine weekly
      for 3 out of 4 weeks, and Avastin will be administered every 2 weeks. Treatment with
      metronomic chemotherapy will be expressed as a 4-week cycle. Tumor response to treatment
      will be evaluated every 8 weeks.

      Treatment with metronomic chemotherapy and Avastin will continue for a total of 6 cycles
      unless there is evidence of disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of
      consent. Maintenance therapy with Avastin will then continue until disease progression,
      intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.

      Potential biologic parameters to monitor anti-tumor activity of metronomic chemotherapy will
      be evaluated in 10 subjects. These biomarkers include: sequential determination of blood
      levels of VEGF, VEGFR2, thrombospondin-1, E-selectin, ICAM-1, and circulating endothelial
      cells and endothelial precursor cells.
