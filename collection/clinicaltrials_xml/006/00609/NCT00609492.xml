  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a
      booster dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals´ pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
      co-administered with a booster dose of DTPa-IPV/Hib (Infanrix-IPV/Hib) in preterm born
      children at the age of 16-18 months. This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome
      measures of the booster phase. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are
      presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number =NCT00390910 ). Subjects participating
      in this study should have received three doses of pneumococcal vaccine in the primary study.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will
             comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study.

          -  A male or female between, and including, 16-18 months of age at the time of the
             booster vaccination.

          -  A male or female who previously participated in study 107737 and received three doses
             of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period (active phase and extended safety follow-up), in which the subject has been or
             will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccines within 30 days preceding the booster dose of study vaccines, or
             planned use during the study period (active phase and 5 months extended safety
             follow-up).

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 6
             months prior to the booster dose of study vaccine.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study
             protocol, during the period starting from one month (30 days) before the booster dose
             of study vaccines (Visit 1) and up to the follow-up visit (Visit 2).

          -  Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B,
             Haemophilus influenzae type b and/or Streptococcus pneumoniae other than the study
             vaccines from study 107737

          -  History of or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, pertussis, polio,

          -  History of seizures or progressive neurological disease

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment.

          -  Febrile illness defined as oral, axillary or tympanic temperature &lt; 37.5°C / rectal
             temperature &lt; 38°C. A temperature greater than or equal to these cut-offs warrants
             deferral of the vaccination pending recovery of the subject.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins, with the exception of monoclonal antibodies
             against RSV, and/or any blood products within three months preceding the booster dose
             of study vaccines or planned administration during the active phase of the study.
