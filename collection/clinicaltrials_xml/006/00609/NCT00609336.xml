      This phase II trial studies how well giving combination chemotherapy together with
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and surgery works in treating patients with
      localized pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as gemcitabine hydrochloride, docetaxel, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized
      radiation therapy, such as IMRT, that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the
      tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) together with intensity-modulated radiation therapy before
      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be
      removed. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after
      surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the median overall survival of patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
      treated with induction chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, surgical resection and
      adjuvant chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percent of patients surviving at annual intervals through five years.

      II. To determine the median recurrence free survival following pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      III. To determine the clinical response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
      chemoradiotherapy.

      IV. To determine the pathologic response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
      chemoradiotherapy.

      V. To determine the cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 tumor marker response rate to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy.

      VI. To determine the surgical completion rate and complication rate following neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy.

      VII. To determine the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment
      regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over
      75 minutes and docetaxel IV over 30 or 60 minutes on days 4 and 11. Patients also receive
      capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NEOADJUVANT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Beginning no more than 14 days after completion of induction
      chemotherapy, patients receive capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14 and oxaliplatin IV over 2
      hours on days 1 and 8. Patients also undergo IMRT once daily on days 1-5 and 8-13.

      SURGICAL RESECTION: Approximately 2-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning 4-10 weeks after surgery, patients receive gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
