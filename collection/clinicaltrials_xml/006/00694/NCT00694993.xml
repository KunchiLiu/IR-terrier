        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects aged between 18 and 50 years inclusive.

          -  Body mass index within the range 19-29.9kg/m2 (inclusive), with weight range of 50
             kg-100 kg (inclusive).

          -  Healthy (defined as individuals who are free from significant nasal, cardiac,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, haematological, malignancy, endocrine,
             neurological and psychiatric disease as determined by history, physical examination
             and screening investigations).

          -  Non-smoking status as verified by urinary cotinine levels below 500 ng/mL cotinine at
             the screening visit. This can include ex-smokers who have given up smoking for &gt;1
             year.

          -  Normal nasal examination as per Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) assessment

          -  No significant ECG abnormalities and QTc (B) &lt;450 msec.

          -  The subject is able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the
             study and is available to complete all study measurements.

          -  Male subjects must agree to abstain from or use a condom during sexual intercourse
             with female partners of childbearing potential, to prevent either pregnancy in the
             female partner or the possible exposure of a pregnant or lactating female to the
             investigational product from the male subject's semen. In addition, female partners
             of male subjects must use a reliable contraceptive method listed in the protocol, or
             they must refrain from sexual intercourse from the first dose of study medication
             until 84 days after the last dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As a result of the medical interview, physical examination or screening
             investigations, the Investigator or appropriately qualified designee considers the
             subject unfit for the study.

          -  The subject has a history of drug or any other allergy, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator or appropriately qualified designee, contraindicates their
             participation, including known or suspected personal history or family history of
             adverse reactions or hypersensitivity to anti histamines

          -  The subject has participated in a study with a new molecular entity during the
             previous 3 months or any other study during the previous 2 months.

          -  The subject regularly, or on average, drinks more than 21 units of alcohol a week or
             more than an average intake of 3 units per day.

          -  The subject is currently taking regular (or a course of) medication, prescribed
             (including all beta-agonists) or not (including over the counter medication or herbal
             remedies such as St Johns Wort). Paracetamol is an exception and will be permitted at
             daily doses of up to 4g following the first dose of investigational product.

          -  The subject has tested positive for hepatitis C antibody or hepatitis B surface
             antigen.

          -  The subject has tested positive for HIV.

          -  The subject has a positive drugs of abuse and alcohol test.

          -  Donation during the study would result in &gt;500mL of blood being donated over a 56 day
             period

          -  Subjects with structural nasal abnormalities frequent nose bleeds, Perennial Allergic
             Rhinitis (PAR) and Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR) unless subjects with SAR are
             asymptomatic and it is outside of the pollen season

          -  Subjects who are unable to comply with study procedures

          -  Subject is the Investigator or any sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct
             of the study
