  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic transplant is curative for many patients with hematological
      neoplasms but conditions to provide optimal engraftment and anti-tumor efficacy with minimal
      toxicity are still under way. Clofarabine is a newly licensed agent with dramatic
      anti-leukemic activity. Its incorporation into a regimen for pre-transplant conditioning of
      acute leukemia and lymphoma patients is logical, exploiting both the anti-tumor activities
      it is recognized to have and the immunosuppressive activity seen with drugs in its class.

    <textblock>
      Non-myeloablative conditioning allows curative allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation for
      patients unable to tolerate more toxic conventional conditioning regiments. These regiments
      continue to be refined and evolve. No standard regimen is yet agreed upon. The incorporation
      of the newly licenses agent Clofarabine into a non-myeloablative regimen is logical given
      its recognized anti-leukemic activity. This study will assess the safety and efficacy of
      Cyclophosphamide and Clofarabine in promoting hematopoietic engraftment after allogeneic
      transplant of blood stem cells. Patients eligibility will include those with advanced
      hematological neoplasms who might benefit from allogeneic blood cell transplant. Patients
      must have adequate organ function and suitable related or unrelated donors for transplant.
      In Phase I of the study 9-12 patients will be treated in order to establish Cyclophosphamide
      and Clofarabine dose, and to confirm reasonable safety and engraftment efficacy. Phase II
      will treat at total of 20 patients at the selected dose level of Clofarabine and
      Cyclophosphamide. Results will be compared to extensive Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical
      Center experience using Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide in a similar patient population.
      Supportive care, including graft versus host disease prophylaxis will be similar to that
      recently used at Hershey Medical Center. Primary endpoints will include survival and
      engraftment as compared to historical results at Hershey Medical Center. Disease specific
      outcomes for frequent diagnoses such as acute leukemia and non-hodgkin's lymphoma will be
      assessed as secondary endpoints.
