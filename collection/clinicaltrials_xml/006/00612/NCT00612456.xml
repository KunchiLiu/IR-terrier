      This is a 28 day study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of pazopanib eye drops on the
      central retinal thickness of AMD patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib has been formulated as an eye drop for the topical treatment of age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD). Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in
      a first study conducted in healthy volunteers (MD7108238). In the present study, three
      dosing regimens of pazopanib eye drops, administered for 28 days, will be evaluated in
      subjects with occult or minimally classic subtypes of choroidal neovascularization due to
      AMD. This study is designed to measure pharmacological activity of topically administered
      pazopanib in target tissues (choroid and retina) of patients with AMD by weekly evaluation
      of central retinal thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Evaluation
      of efficacy will be performed on an exploratory basis by weekly measurement of visual
      acuity. The ocular and systemic safety and systemic pharmacokinetics of pazopanib treatment
      for 28 days will also be evaluated.
