      We are conducting an open, prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the bioequivalence of
      polyvinylpyrrolidone formulations of T.R.U.E. TEST fragrance mix and thimerosal allergens.
      Bioequivalence will be determined in 40 adult subjects, 20 per allergen, with a clinical
      history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test (current or previous) to the
      corresponding reference petrolatum allergen (&quot;sensitives&quot;).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or previous symptoms and/or history consistent with allergic contact
             dermatitis, and positive patch test (within the past 5 years) to fragrance mix AND/OR
             thimerosal.

          -  All subjects must be adults (18 years of age or older) and otherwise in good health.

          -  Pre-menopausal female subjects must consent to a urine pregnancy test; results must
             be negative for study inclusion.

          -  Informed consent must be signed and understood by each subject, and consistent with
             all institutional, local and national regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects unable to meet inclusion requirements.

          -  Women who are breastfeeding or pregnant.

          -  Topical treatment during the last 7 days with corticosteroids or other
             immunosuppressive agents on or near the test area.

          -  Systemic treatment during the last 7 days with corticosteroids (equivalent to &gt; 10 mg
             prednisone) or other immunosuppressive agents.

          -  Treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light (including tanning) during the previous 3
             weeks.

          -  Acute dermatitis outbreak or dermatitis on or near the test area on the back.

          -  Subjects unable to comply with patch test study requirements including multiple
             return visits and activity restrictions (e.g., protecting test panels from excess
             moisture due to showering or vigorous activity).

          -  Subject participation in clinical trials of investigational drugs, treatments, or
             devices, other than T.R.U.E. TEST, during this study or 3 weeks prior to inclusion in
             this study.
