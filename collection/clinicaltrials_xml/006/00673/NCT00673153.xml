      RATIONALE: Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by interfering with various
      proteins needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO),
      can block cancer growth in different ways. GO finds cancer cells and helps kill them by
      carrying a cancer-killing substance to them. Giving vorinostat together with gemtuzumab
      ozogamicin may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vorinostat together with gemtuzumab
      ozogamicin works in treating older patients with previously untreated acute myeloid
      leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the CR/CRi rate after treatment with vorinostat plus GO. (Good risk group)
      II. To determine the 30-day survival after treatment with vorinostat plus GO. (Poor risk
      group)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the frequency and severity of regimen-associated toxicities, along with
      30-day survival after start of treatment with vorinostat plus GO. (Good risk group) II. To
      determine the CR/CRi rate after treatment with vorinostat plus GO, and estimate the
      frequency and severity of regimen-associated toxicities. (Poor risk group) III. To
      investigate the relapse-free survival of patients who achieve CR/CRi and receive maintenance
      therapy on this study.

      IV. To define cellular factors associated with clinical response to GO/vorinostat and
      determine the mechanisms underlying the synergistic effect between GO and vorinostat on
      primary AML cells (in vitro correlative and mechanistic studies).

      OUTLINE:

      REMISSION INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-9 and
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on day 8. Treatment repeats every 15-22 days for up to
      3 courses.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning within 60 days after the completion of remission induction
      therapy, patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-9 and gemtuzumab ozogamicin
      IV over 2 hours on day 8.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-14. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 4 courses.

      All treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3
      years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Morphological diagnosis of AML other then acute promyelocytic leukemia (FAB M3)
             according to WHO diagnostic criteria; diagnosis of AML must be based on bone marrow
             or peripheral blood studies obtained within 28 days prior to study registration or
             start of hydroxyurea (for patients presenting with WBC &gt;= 10,000/uL), and no
             potentially anti-leukemic therapy (with the exception of hydroxyurea) must have been
             given between AML diagnosis and study registration; a bone marrow biopsy is not
             routinely required but should be obtained if the aspirate is dilute, hypocellular, or
             inaspirable; outside bone marrows performed within the stipulated time period are
             acceptable as long as the slides are reviewed at a study institution

          -  Cytogenetic analysis on bone marrow or peripheral blood specimen is available; based
             on the result from the first interim analysis, patients stratified into the good-risk
             group are only eligible if their AML has favorable cytogenetics (core-binding factor
             AML) or has a normal karyotype; patients stratified into the poor-risk group are
             eligible independent of the cytogenetic analysis

          -  Pretreatment bone marrow and peripheral blood specimens for correlative studies are
             available; if bone marrow was performed at an outside facility, submission of
             peripheral blood only is acceptable as long as the peripheral blast count is &gt;
             5,000/uL and &gt; 50% of total WBC

          -  Patients with a history of antecedent MDS are eligible, if prior treatment did not
             include intensive chemotherapy; patients may have received hematopoietic growth
             factors, thalidomide/lenalidomide, 5-azacytidine/decitabine, arsenic trioxide, signal
             transduction inhibitors, or low dose cytarabine (&lt; 100 mg/m2/day) for treatment of
             MDS; patients must be off prior therapy for MDS at least 30 days prior to study
             registration, and all non-hematologic toxicities must have resolved to &lt; grade 2

          -  ECOG/WHO/Zubrod performance status of 0-3

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 2.5 x Institutional Upper Limit of Normal (IULN) unless elevation is
             thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilbert's syndrome, or hemolysis
             (assessed within 14 days prior to registration)

          -  SGOT (AST) and SPGT (ALT) =&lt; 1.5 x IULN unless elevation is thought to be due to
             hepatic infiltration by AML (assessed within 14 days prior to registration)

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x IULN (assessed within 14 days prior to registration)

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;= 40% and no clinical evidence of congestive
             heart failure (assessed within 28 days prior to registration, e.g. by MUGA scan or
             echocardiography)

          -  Men of reproductive potential must use an effective contraceptive method throughout
             the study and for a period of at least 3 months after the study

          -  Women must be postmenopausal; a postmenopausal woman is defined as a woman who has
             experienced amenorrhea &gt; 12 consecutive months or a woman on hormone replacement
             therapy with documented FSH level &gt; 35 mIU/mL (women of childbearing potential must
             have a pregnancy test within 28 days prior to registration, and must use an adequate
             method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for a period of
             at least 3 months after the study)

             malignancy at the time of study registration; prior treatment with AML induction-type
             chemotherapy is not allowed (note the following exceptions: patients with treated
             non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,
             regardless of the disease-free duration, are eligible for this study if definitive
             treatment for the condition has been completed; patients with organ-confined prostate
             cancer with no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease based on
             prostate-specific antigen [PSA] values are also eligible for this study if hormonal

          -  Clinical evidence suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) involvement with
             leukemia unless a lumbar puncture confirms the absence of leukemic blasts in the
             cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)

          -  Prior positive test for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Breastfeeding

          -  Uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection (defined as
