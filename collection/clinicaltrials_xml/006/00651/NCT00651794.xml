  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) is the curriculum used to teach providers how to
      care for newborns in the delivery room. Breakdowns in teamwork and communication contribute
      to NRP quality problems. Adding teamwork instruction to NRP may be a method to improve
      communication, teamwork, and the overall quality of neonatal resuscitation. This study uses
      simulation to incorporate team training into NRP and to evaluate both the effectiveness and
      duration of the team training. Furthermore, because high fidelity simulation is very
      expensive and not widely available, we will compare NRP with low fidelity team training to
      NRP with high fidelity team training.

      Our hypotheses are:

        1. NRP with low fidelity team training results in a) better teamwork, and b) better
           quality of care compared with standard NRP.

        2. NRP with high fidelity team training does not result in better teamwork or better
           quality of care than NRP with low fidelity simulation.

        3. NRP with high fidelity team training does not produce a longer lasting effect on
           teamwork than NRP with low fidelity simulation.

    <description>Crew Resource Management (CRM) is an aviation training program mandated for all crew members that teaches human factors concepts, communication skills, and teamwork behaviors that can prevent and manage error. Over the last six years our group has translated these behaviors to neonatal resuscitation and demonstrated that they can be reliably measured. The existing NRP course, taught to most caregivers in the United States who care for newborns, focuses on teaching the technical aspects of neonatal resuscitation with little attention paid to communication and teamwork. Adding teamwork instruction to NRP, based upon CRM, may be a method to improve communication, teamwork, and the overall quality of neonatal resuscitation.</description>
