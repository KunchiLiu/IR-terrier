             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator considers that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Demonstrates an average QTc interval &lt; 450 msec (or &lt; 480 msec in subjects with
             bundle branch block), an average PR interval &lt; 200 msec, and a QRS duration &lt; 110msec
             (manual or machine read) at screening or baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Previous exposure to GSK376501.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Demonstrates symptomatic or asymptomatic arrhythmia of any clinical significance
             during screening.
