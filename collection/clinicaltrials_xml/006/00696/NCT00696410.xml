  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure affects over 5.3 million Americans and, while other cardiovascular diseases
      have enjoyed a reduction in mortality rates over the last decade, the mortality from heart
      failure continues to rise[1]. Thus, identifying novel therapies that can reduce heart
      failure development and/or progression are warranted. Unifying to most cardiomyopathic
      processes is an impaired handling of reactive oxygen species (ROS)[2-4]. Reactive oxygen
      species are generated as byproducts of inflammation and oxidative stress that occur in the
      setting of normal myocardial aerobic metabolism. Metallothionein, glutathione reductase, and
      superoxide dismutase are major antioxidants in the myocardium that help combat oxidative
      stress and prevent myocardial damage. In certain clinical settings, including cardiac
      ischemia, diabetes, and heavy metal excess (copper, iron), myocardial oxidative stress
      levels are greatly increased. When pro-oxidant levels exceed myocardial antioxidant
      capabilities, ROS-induced membrane, protein, and DNA inactivation can lead to the
      development of cardiac dysfunction.

      One means of preventing the development or progression of cardiomyopathy is to reduce
      oxidative stress through up-regulation of intramyocardial antioxidants. Murine studies of
      cardiomyopathy have shown that oral administration of zinc acetate may succeed as an
      indirect myocardial anti-oxidant because zinc sufficiently up-regulates the intramyocardial
      production of superoxide dismutase (a zinc-dependant anti-oxidant enzyme) and
      metallothionein (a &quot;super antioxidant&quot;) [5-8]. Zinc also directly reduces prooxidant Cu
      levels by reducing gastrointestinal zinc absorption. However, to date, no studies have
      examined the impact of zinc acetate supplementation in subjects with cardiomyopathy and
      systolic failure on antioxidant capacity and remodeling.

      The hypothesis of this pilot study is that administration of oral zinc acetate to humans
      with cardiomyopathy will lead to an up-regulation of myocardial anti-oxidant
      capabilities,leading to a favorable reduction in oxidative stress. This study will provide
      preliminary data to support a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of zinc therapy in heart
      failure as a means of improving or preventing the progression of systolic dysfunction in
      subjects with mild-moderate heart failure.

      Altered regulation of the transition-metal copper (Cu) may lead to an overproduction of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) with subsequent development of a nonischemic cardiomyopathy
      (NISCM). Myocardial Cu levels are elevated in NISCM, and Cu levels are highest in the
      &quot;diabetic cardiomyopathy.&quot; In humans, zinc (Zn) is an essential component of proteins
      critical for regulating myocardial cytoskeleton turnover and cellular proliferation. Zn also
      serves as an antioxidant and indirect regulator of redox-active Cu. By upregulating the
      chelator metallothionein, Zn reduces the levels of free Cu implicated in oxidative
      myocardial damage.

      Transgenic over-expression of the antioxidant metallothionein has been shown to reduce
      ROS-induced myocardial damage. In diabetic cardiomyopathy, Cu chelation improves left
      ventricular (LV) diastolic relaxation abnormalities. However, it is unknown if Zn
      supplementation could alter the progression of LV systolic dysfunction through Cu depletion
      and ROS reduction. The aim of this pilot study is to assess the impact of a novel
      intervention, Zn supplementation, on myocardial remodeling by examining changes in serum
      levels of the types I (PINP) and III (PIIINP) collagen N-terminal propeptides. The primary
      study hypothesis is that Zn supplementation will have a favorable impact on the
      pathophysiology of NISCM by either repleting a Zn deficiency/insufficiency or by reducing
      myocardial damage and adverse remodeling in the setting of redox-active Cu excess.

      Stable outpatients (n=40) with chronic NISCM (ejection fraction ≤40%) will receive daily
      oral Zn-acetate (50 mg po tid) for 10 months. Serum PINP, PIIINP, and markers of
      inflammation (CRP, sedimentation rate, myeloperoxidase) and oxidative stress (8-isoprostane,
      superoxide dismutase) will be obtained at baseline and following 10 months of Zn
      supplementation. Changes in collagen turnover will then be correlated with changes noted in
      LV systolic and diastolic function by echocardiography. Finally, we will examine for a
      differential treatment effect of Zn therapy in a diabetic subset (n=20) with NISCM compared
      with the nondiabetics.
