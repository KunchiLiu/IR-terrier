      This study is looking at 3 different types of enemas used before receptive anal intercourse
      in men who have sex with men (MSM). We are investigating whether the enemas cause any damage
      to the lining of the colon, how far up the colon the enemas travel after they are given, and
      how much study participants like using each of the enemas.

               -  Required to assure that subjects are likely to complete each stage of enema test
                  article use in a reasonable amount of time.

          -  History of enema use prior to RAI at least some of the time

          -  Willing to use each study product prior to RAI on 3 separate occasions.

          -  Willing to refrain from RAI for 48 hours before and after inpatient periods.

          -  Willing to use condoms for the duration of the study

          -  Availability to return for all study visits, barring unforeseen circumstances

          -  Understands and agrees to local STI reporting requirements

          -  Able and willing to communicate in English

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent to take part in the study

          -  HIV positive at baseline

          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Active inflammatory condition of the GI tract at baseline

          -  Active rectal infection at Visit 2 (Infections identified during the screening period
             must be treated prior to Visit 2)

          -  Presence of any painful anorectal conditions that would be tender to manipulation.
             (Participants with hemorrhoids and/or anal warts that are not painful may
             participate.)

          -  History of prosthetic cardiac valves, including bioprosthetic and homograft valves,
             previous bacterial endocarditis, surgically constructed systemic pulmonary shunts or
             conduits, and complex cyanotic congenital heart disease such as single ventricle
             states, transposition of the great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot or similar
             conditions that put the subject at high risk for bacteremia during endoscopy, hence
             requiring antibiotic prophylaxis.

          -  Unwillingness to refrain from chronic use of aspirin and NSAIDs.

          -  Use of warfarin or heparin

          -  Use of any investigational products within 72 hours of Visit 2 baseline

          -  Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would make the patient unsuitable for the study or unable to comply
             with the study requirements. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to,
             current or recent history of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, neurological, cerebral
             disease, or coagulopathies.
