  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a drug named Fluvastatin is beneficial and
      safe in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and blood clots in patients with
      antiphospholipid antibodies or Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS).

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the effects of fluvastatin on
      pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory markers in aPL-positive lupus and non-lupus patients
      (primary endpoint) and to determine the safety of fluvastatin in aPL-positive lupus and
      non-lupus patients (secondary endpoint).

      All eligible patients will sign an IRB-approved consent form during the screening visit and
      give blood for baseline laboratory tests. Within a week of the screening visit, all patients
      will be started on Fluvastatin 40 mg daily for three months. At three months patients will
      be instructed to stop the study medication and they will be followed for another three
      months. Thus, the total duration of the study is six months: first three months is
      interventional and the last three months is observational.
