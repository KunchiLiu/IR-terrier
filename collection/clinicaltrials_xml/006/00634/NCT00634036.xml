  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthmatics who are significantly overweight tend to have more severe symptoms, more flare
      ups, and are more likely to have poorly-controlled asthma when compared to other asthmatics.

      Researchers believe this occurs because excess adipose tissue (fat) in the body can cause
      higher-than-normal levels of leptin and lower-than-normal levels of adiponectin in the
      blood.

      The researchers of this study are testing a medication called pioglitazone in overweight
      asthmatics because they believe it can help regulate leptin and adiponectin and that this
      may improve symptoms of asthma.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to
      pioglitazone or a placebo (an inactive pill). They will be given study medication to take
      everyday for 12 weeks (3 months).

      Participants will complete a number of asthma-related questionnaires and a variety of
      pulmonary function tests. Participants will undergo physical exams, an electrocardiogram,
      and blood sampling to measure leptin, adiponectin, markers of inflammation, blood cell
      counts, glucose levels, BNP hormone levels, and liver function.

      To monitor participants throughout the study, follow-up visits will be done at 2, 6, and 12
      weeks after starting study drug. At these visits many of the pulmonary function tests and
      questionnaires will be repeated.
