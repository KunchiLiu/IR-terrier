  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several human genes affect how medications are metabolized by the body. It is believed that
      knowledge of variations of these genes can help health care providers better manage an
      anticoagulation medicine called warfarin (Coumadin®)and as a result decrease patient
      problems with bleeding or the development of blood clots. This study is designed to evaluate
      if genetic testing can improve warfarin initiation better than usual care.

    <description>Pharmacogenetic-based warfarin dosing: Warfarin dosing based on formula that incorporates genetic testing results.
NOTE: Standard of care for elective knee and hip replacement at our institution is to receive post-operative warfarin thromboprophylaxis. Administration of warfarin is not specific to this study, nor is the duration of prophylaxis, however, warfarin dosing will be influenced by the study arm, as noted above.</description>

    <description>Prior to elective joint replacement surgery a blood sample is collected for genetic information(genotyping)which will be used for calculating warfarin doses for patients randomized to the cytochrome arm. Outcomes in terms of efficacy, safety, and management of warfarin will be compared between this group and the group in which warfarin doses are determined per usual care.
