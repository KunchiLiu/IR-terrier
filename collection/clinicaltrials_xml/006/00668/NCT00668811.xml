    <textblock>
      This study is comparing a drug called Sutent with standard of care treatment for people with
      advanced thyroid cancer. Because advanced thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly common and
      effective treatment options are limited, new therapies are desperately needed.

      This study is designed to see if Sutent following therapy with radioactive iodine will
      target cancer cells and delay disease progression better than standard therapy alone. Newly
      diagnosed patients, who are scheduled to receive radioactive iodine as part of their
      standard care are possible candidates. By entering into this study, participants agree to
      take oral Sutent for approximately one year after completing standard therapy. During this
      time, study participants will be followed closely by their doctor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-stage, phase II with historical controls, single center, targeted therapy
      trial enrolling patients with stage 2 (for patients younger than 45 years of age), 3 or 4
      differentiated thyroid cancer. The primary objective is to assess progression free survival
      in this population in comparison to historical controls. Sutent will be given orally at
      37.5mg daily for two (2) year, or 26 cycles. Each treatment cycle will consist of 28 days.
      Upon treatment discontinuation, patients will be followed for survival. The frequency and
      type of survival follow-up assessments performed will be at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

    <description>Sutent 37.5 mg/day will be given orally after radioactive iodine therapy. Total time of Sutent drug administration will be 52 weeks, absent unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Sutent is supplied as 12.5mg and 25 mg tablets. Patients are to swallow the tablets whole with approximately 250 ml (8 oz.) of water, fasting each morning. Patients will be given monthly calendars (patient diaries) to document the time when the Sutent pills are taken. At monthly visits, patients will bring back this record and the drug bottles.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study population will consist of men and women with histologically confirmed stage 2
        (younger than 45 years of age), 3 or stage 4 differentiated thyroid cancer (e.g.,
        papillary or follicular thyroid cancer) that has been previously treated with at least one
        course of radioactive iodine therapy and has evidence of residual, recurrent or
        progressive disease documented by any combination of radiologic studies and thyroglobulin
        levels.

        To be eligible for inclusion, patients must fulfill each of the following criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to study-specific screening procedures, with
             the understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any
             time, without prejudice.

          2. Age &gt;18 years.

          3. Histologically confirmed stage 2 (younger than 45 years of age), 3 or stage 4
             differentiated thyroid cancer (i.e., papillary or follicular thyroid cancer).

             a. If a patient has distant metastases, it must be documented by any combination of
             radiographic studies or whole body radioiodine scanning.

          4. Previously treated with at least one course of radioactive iodine (I-131) therapy.

          5. At least one measurable site of disease as defined by the Tumor Assessment Criteria
             in Appendix 3.

          6. Serum thyroglobulin levels inappropriately elevated:
