  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if IMC-A12 alone or in combination with Cetuximab
      (Erbitux®) can increase survival in patients with Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer who
      have had disease progression and platinum-containing chemotherapeutic regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The routine cancer treatments for Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head and Neck Cancer have improved
      but still leave a percentage of patients with incurable disease. New alternatives for
      patients whose disease is refractory to existing therapies is needed.

      IMC-A12 is a monoclonal antibody which binds to special receptors known as IGF-1R. This
      binding action has been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluation the effects of IMC-A12 by itself or with
      Cetuximab (Erbitux®) in patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head and Neck Cancer that has
      spread to other parts of the body, and to determine how long the drug remains in the body.
      The study will also look at what side effects IMC-A12 may cause when a patient is receiving
      treatment.
