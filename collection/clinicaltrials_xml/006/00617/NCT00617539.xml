      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and temozolomide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving irinotecan together with
      temozolomide and to see how well it works in treating patients with breast cancer who have
      received previous treatment for brain metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the objective response rate systemically and in the CNS to the combination
           of irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide among patients with breast cancer and
           progressive brain metastases that have progressed after previous treatment for brain
           metastases.

        -  To determine the toxicities associated with the combination of irinotecan hydrochloride
           and temozolomide in breast cancer patients with progressive brain metastases.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the time to first progression at any site (CNS or extra-CNS) in patients
           treated with the combination of irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival of patients treated with the combination of irinotecan
           hydrochloride and temozolomide for brain metastases.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 15 and oral temozolomide on days 1-7
      and 15-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 4 weeks.
