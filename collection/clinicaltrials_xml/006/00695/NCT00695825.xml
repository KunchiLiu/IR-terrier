  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent population studies have shown that the glycemic index (GI) of food products is
      positively associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease
      (CVD). In the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and CVD, inflammatory processes play a pivotal
      role. In a previous intervention study (11 weeks), however, we found no effects of lower-GI
      vs. higher-GI diets on fasting inflammatory markers in subjects with increased risk of
      developing the metabolic syndrome. People, however, spent most of their time in the
      postprandial period. Therefore, there is a need to study the postprandial effects of low-GI
      vs. high-GI diets. In addition, it needs to be emphasized the GI is derived from studies in
      lean subjects, while especially overweight and obese people suffer from metabolic
      aberrations related to the development of type 2 diabetes and CVD. AIM: To investigate in
      obese subjects the postprandial effects of a low-GI vs. high-GI food product on metabolic
      risk markers. A second research objective is to compare these effects with those in lean
      subjects.
