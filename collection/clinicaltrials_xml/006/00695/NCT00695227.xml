  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to develop an accurate method to identify patients that
      suffer from acid reflux, but may not present with classic reflux symptoms (such as heart
      burn). Additionally, it is the purpose of this project to utilize the Unsedated
      Small-caliber Endoscopy (USE) to assess the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in a
      population of patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) symptoms and to define normal
      patterns of LPR. Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is when a small amount of stomach contents
      and acid are pushed up through the esophagus and may affect the vocal cords and upper
      respiratory tract.

      It is suspected that patients with LPR symptoms may have a prevalence of Barrett's esophagus
      similar to that found in a population with typical reflux symptoms. We propose to
      systematically test this hypothesis using the USE.

      This project is designed to improve the methods of identifying patients with a form of acid
      reflux that is often undetected, and thus untreated. If this project is successful then more
      patients with Barrett's esophagus will be identified; furthermore, screening and treatment
      for this pre-cancerous condition will be improved.
