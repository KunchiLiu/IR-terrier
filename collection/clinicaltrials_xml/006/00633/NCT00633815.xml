  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fontan-palliated patients comprise an interesting group of single-ventricle patients who are
      dependent upon passive return of blood from the body to the lungs. Systemic venous pressures
      are therefore quite elevated, and one study demonstrated that venous capacitance was
      diminished. In addition, these patients have markedly diminished aerobic capacity (Max VO2).
      Although one recent study demonstrated that Fontan patients can increase their Max VO2
      through diligent cardiac rehabilitation, their ultimate results were still well below
      average.

      It has previously been described that normal, healthy subjects have decreased exercise
      performance in a supine vs upright position. However, due to high venous pressures and the
      need for systemic venous return to overcome gravity in order to perfuse the lungs, one might
      hypothesize that Fontan patients would have increased exercise performance in a supine vs
      upright position. The investigators are interested in studying this hypothesis.

        Fontan-palliated patients aged 8-30 will be recruited for this study. Eligible patients
        will be identified from the cardiology and surgery database here. Patients will be
        contacted by phone and/or formal letter informing them of the study. If their primary
        cardiologist is not in our group, a courtesy call will be made or letter sent. Age and
        gender matched healthy controls will be sought as well through local recruitment (schools,
        university campus, local community postings).
