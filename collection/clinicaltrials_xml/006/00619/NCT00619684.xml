    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenalidomide works in treating patients with
      progressive or recurrent multiple myeloma after a donor stem cell transplant. Lenalidomide
      may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It may also
      stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response of relapsed or progressive multiple myeloma to lenalidomide after
      allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      II. Proportion of patients achieving a complete, partial or minor response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate toxicity and tolerability of lenalidomide in this setting.

      II. For patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), evaluate the response to
      lenalidomide.

      III. Evaluate time to progression (TTP).

      IV. Evaluate overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days for 2
      years or longer in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
