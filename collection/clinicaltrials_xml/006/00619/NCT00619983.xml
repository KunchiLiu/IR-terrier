  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the combination of the the three drugs
      gabapentin, duloxetine, and donepezil are effective in treating pain in people with diabetic
      neuropathy or patients with failed low back syndrome (chronic back pain).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is a complex and likely heterogeneous disorder, and we recognize that
      clinically useful agents such as opioids, gabapentin, and antidepressants may be effective
      precisely because they have multiple mechanisms of action at multiple sites. This study,
      however, will not only provide important mechanistic information regarding one cascade which
      can be manipulated for analgesia, but will also provide much needed systematic and practical
      guidance for multi-drug therapy in patients with neuropathic pain.

      This study in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain and patients with failed low back
      syndrome, culminate in a quantitative description of interactions between activators of
      descending noradrenergic activity, norepinephrine transporter inhibitors, and cholinesterase
      inhibitors to exploit the plasticity of analgesia in chronic pain states. We will focus on
      practical applications, using clinically approved drugs, including gabapentin (Neurontin®)
      to activate noradrenergic activity, duloxetine (Cymbalta®) to inhibit the norepinephrine
      transporter, and donepezil (Aricept®), approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia,
      but not previously tested to treat neuropathic pain, to inhibit cholinesterase.

      After the baseline measurements and physical examination patients will be trained to use a
      Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to answer questions about their diabetic neuropathic pain
      or their chronic back pain. Upon successful completion of these tasks the patients will be
      randomized to receive one of the drug choices or placebo (inactive pill).

      The study will last for a total of 16 weeks and includes 5 visits to the research center
      with each visit lasting approximately 2 hours.
