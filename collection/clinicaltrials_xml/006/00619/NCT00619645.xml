      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and busulfan, before a donor
      peripheral stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an
      immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate
      mofetil before and after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving donor peripheral stem
      cell transplant together with fludarabine and busulfan and to see how well it works in
      treating patients with hematologic cancers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the efficacy and toxicity of reduced-intensity allogeneic peripheral blood
           stem cell transplantation in patients with hematological malignancies treated with
           conditioning therapy comprising fludarabine phosphate and busulfan.

        -  To evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  To determine donor chimerism.

        -  To access the risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -6 and -5 and
           fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2.

        -  Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSC): Patients undergo allogeneic
           PBSC on day 0.

        -  Immunosuppressive therapy/graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients
           achieve100% donor T-cell chimerism on day 30 without disease recurrence, and
           cyclosporine A (CSA) IV continuously over 24 hours or orally every 12 hours on days -1
           to 60 followed by a taper until day 100 and oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) once every
           12 hours on days 1-40, in the absence of ≥ grade 2 GVHD.

      Patients with recurrent disease or &lt; 100% donor T-cell chimerism (on day 30) undergo a
      12-day CSA and MMF taper followed by escalating doses of previously collected donor
      leukocyte infusion every 4 weeks until 100% donor T-cell chimerism or disease regression, in
      the absence of ≥ grade 2 GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
