  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The placement of endotracheal tubes (intubation) is a physiologically stressful procedure
      for patients. Laryngoscopes are devices-typically composed of a blade attached to a handle
      with a light source—that allow examination of the upper airway through the mouth, often for
      the purposes of intubation. Recently some new laryngoscope devices (including the Airtraq®
      Optical Laryngoscope, the Storz DCI Video laryngoscope®, McGRATH® Video Laryngoscope, and
      the GlideScope®) have been developed, which may either decrease the stress related to
      intubation (reduce neck extension, reduce risk of complications or reduce time elapsed
      during intubation) or improve intubation success (reduce the number of attempts at
      intubating). Data are being collected in this study to determine which of these
      commonly-used devices may be better, particularly in comparison to the current hospital
      standard, the Macintosh laryngoscope. All of the devices to be used in this study are
      currently cleared or exempt by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
