  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate if fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole)can treat symptoms associated with
      alcohol intolerance due to aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) Deficiency, an inherited
      metabolic disorder. These symptoms include flushing, nausea, headache, shortness of breath
      and dizziness, resulting from exposure to acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of ethanol.
      Long-term, serious health risks have been associated with repeated exposure to acetaldehyde,
      a carcinogen, among ALDH2-deficient individuals.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled in ascending dosing cohorts of 8 subjects each.
      Each subject will receive an oral dose of study drug (fomepizole or placebo) with
      concomitant ethanol with group assignment in a randomized 1:1:1:1 ratio (2 subjects each
      group) on Study Day 1. Each subject is their own intra-subject control with the alternative
      study drug (fomepizole or placebo) administered on the next day (Study Day 2). Four subjects
      in each cohort will receive study drug (fomepizole or placebo) administered 30 minutes prior
      to ethanol, 4 with study drug (fomepizole or placebo) administered 30 minutes after ethanol.
      The study will assess safety and tolerability of fomepizole and the PK/PD of 4-MP, ethanol
      and acetaldehyde in the subject population.

    <description>Each subject will, in a blinded controlled manner, receive alternating study treatment (fomepizole or placebo) on 2 sequential days (Study Day 1 and Study Day 2). In addition, the study drug (fomepizole or placebo) will be administered in the 4 subjects in each cohort 30 minutes prior to ethanol, and in 4 subjects in each cohort 30 minutes after the ethanol.</description>
