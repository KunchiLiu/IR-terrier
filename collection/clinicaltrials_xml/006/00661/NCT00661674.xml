  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid medications are commonly used for pain relief. When given over time, physical
      dependence can occur. This results in unpleasant side effects--such as agitation and
      nausea--if opioid medications are suddenly stopped. We are interested in knowing if a
      medication named Ondansetron can help ease or prevent symptoms associated with opioid
      withdrawal. We are also interested in knowing if a similar (but more potent FDA-approved
      drug, palonosetron) can more effectively treat withdrawal symptoms with or without
      combination with an antihistamine called hydroxyzine (vistaril).

      We hope to learn if Ondansetron, Palonosetron, and/or combination with hydroxyzine can be
      used to prevent or attenuate the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. If we find that it
      can help prevent these symptoms, it may become a new treatment that can aid patients
      suffering from these symptoms.

    <description>The OOWS is a 13-item instrument documenting physically observable signs of withdrawal, which are rated as present (1) or absent (0) during the observation period.</description>

    <time_frame>The SOWS score will be measure 5 times during the study visit, at T=0 minutes, T=10 minutes, T=145 minutes, T=170 minutes, and T=180 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The SOWS score is composed of 16 subjective symptoms rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 4=extremely) based on what subjects were experiencing at the time of testing.</description>
