      RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with cancer may help doctors learn more
      about the disease and plan early diagnosis and treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying computer tools for improving early diagnosis and
      treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer, are at risk for pancreatic cancer, or have a
      non-cancerous pancreatic disorder.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Develop Integrated Biomedical Computing Tools (IBCT) for the better understanding and
           treatment of pancreatic cancer by using the power of computer and informatics sciences.

        -  Continue development of the Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry (PCCR)
           infrastructure to act as a repository for socio-demographic, environmental, clinical,
           and family history data collected from individuals and interested family members with a
           personal and/or family history of pancreatic cancer.

        -  Participate in an international pancreatic registry known as the PCCR by sharing
           information collected for research purposes only, to be used by pancreatic cancer
           research collaborators from other institutions.

        -  Collect and bank excess biological materials (i.e., pancreatic tissue, tumor tissue,
           and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer tissue, and/or paraffin-embedded tissue), blood,
           and serum from registry participants for future research.

        -  Establish an infrastructure with core data elements and standardized operating
           procedures for specimen collection, processing, and storage for the EDRN Pancreatic
           Cancer Working Group project to use as a resource for the development of biomarkers for
           the early detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo blood and pancreatic tissue collection. Normal, tumor, and/or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer tissue, and/or paraffin-embedded tissue from prior surgery or biopsy are
      obtained.

      Patients provide or complete personal information about themselves, their medical history,
      their diet and lifestyle habits, any past or current environmental exposures, and re-create
      their family tree for any cancers that have occurred in any of their family members.
      Clinical data is collected annually.

      Control participants provide blood samples and complete questionnaires at baseline. Clinical
      data is collected annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients per group (i.e., cancer cases, healthy controls,
      acute biliary obstruction cases, and chronic pancreatitis cases) for a total of 240 patients
      will be accrued for EDRN portion of this study. A total of ~5,000 patients will be accrued
      to the PCCR portion of this study.

This information will be collected by whichever method they prefer; completing the questionnaires on hardcopy (to then be entered into the PCCR by a data manager) or by logging on to the PCCR website to complete the questionnaires by obtaining a user id and password to enter their information directly into the PCCR. Study participants who are in the EDRN project are required to complete the questionnaires on hardcopy (to then be entered into the PCCR by a data manager).</description>
