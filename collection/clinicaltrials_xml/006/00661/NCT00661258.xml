      This study focuses on collecting and analyzing quantitative data related to adherence to
      antiretroviral treatment from patients in Dali, China, over a one-year time-frame and
      generating preliminary data on an intervention designed to improve adherence to
      antiretroviral treatment among the study population.

    <description>The intervention group patients were given their electronic drug monitoring data at each monthly visit. The study coordinator would quickly calculate whether the patient's adherence was below 95% in the previous month. If so, that patient was flagged for enhanced counseling with a clinic doctor and this counseling was based on a printout containing the electronic drug monitoring data.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group patients were not given the data from the electronic data monitoring. Instead, they filled out a self report form that all patients fill out. If they indicated in this report that their adherence in the previous was less than 95%, then they were flagged for &quot;enhanced counseling&quot; with a doctor. This counseling was based on the patient's self report. Thus both groups received enhanced counseling if they indicated poor adherence, but only the intervention group were given their electronic data output.</description>

    <description>All patients were given electronic drug monitors that can monitor pill-taking behavior. In the intervention arm, patients and their attending doctors were given the electronic drug monitoring data on pill bottle openings at each monthly visit for use in adherence counseling sessions. Control arm patients were not given their electronic drug monitoring data and their counseling sessions were based on self-reported adherence, as per standard of care in Dali.</description>
