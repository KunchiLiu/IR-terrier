  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to show the percentage of patients taking antipsychotics with PTSD by
      looking at approximately ten year’s worth of data from 1994 through 2004. We will also
      determine the type and dose of antipsychotics the patients received, and to determine how
      many of those patients had psychotic versus nonpsychotic symptoms. We will be obtaining this
      data from the VISN 7 Corporate Data Warehouse. We hypothesize that there has been an overall
      increase in antipsychotic use in patient’s with PTSD over the last 10 years.
