      This is a two arm, double-blind randomized study looking at the effect of zoledronate, a
      bisphosphonate, on the bone mineral density (BMD) of postmenopausal women with breast
      cancer. An approved bisphosphonate, alendronate, is of benefit in patients with
      osteoporosis, however, this agent has a roughly 30% incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms
      and up to 50% of patients may take the drug improperly, compromising absorption and
      potentially efficacy. Zoledronate is a heterocyclic imidazole third generation
      bisphosphonate, which is administered intravenously (IV) and has little toxicity.
      Zoledronate is more potent than alendronate, and because of its route of administration it
      does not have the problems of poor oral bioavailability and non-compliance.
