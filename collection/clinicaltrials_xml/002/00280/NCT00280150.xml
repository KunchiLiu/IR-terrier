      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy
      uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving combination chemotherapy
      together with bevacizumab, radiation therapy, and erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bevacizumab and
      erlotinib when given together with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy and to see
      how well they work in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride when
           given together with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and thoracic conformal radiotherapy in
           patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. (Phase I [closed to
           accrual as of 1/3/2008])

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I
           [closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008])

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with induction therapy
           comprising carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab followed by chemoradiotherapy
           comprising thoracic conformal radiotherapy, carboplatin, paclitaxel, bevacizumab, and
           erlotinib hydrochloride and consolidation therapy comprising bevacizumab and erlotinib
           hydrochloride. (Phase II)

        -  Determine the overall toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with induction therapy comprising
           carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab. (Phase I[closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008]
           and II)

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of induction therapy in these patients. (Phase I [closed
           to accrual as of 1/3/2008] and II)

        -  Determine the overall response rate and survival profile in patients treated with this
           regimen. (Phase I [closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008] and II)

        -  Determine the feasibility and tolerability of administering consolidation therapy
           comprising erlotinib hydrochloride and bevacizumab after treatment with combined
           modality therapy (induction therapy and chemoradiotherapy) in these patients. (Phase I
           [closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008] and II)

        -  Collect tumor and blood samples from these patients for future analysis of correlation
           between molecular markers and clinical benefit. (Phase I [closed to accrual as of
           1/3/2008] and II)

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, controlled, phase I (closed to accrual as of
      1/3/2008), dose-escalation study of bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride, followed by a
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I (closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008):

             -  Induction therapy: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, carboplatin IV
                over 15-30 minutes, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment
                repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients with stable or responding disease
                proceed to chemoradiotherapy.

             -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive chemoradiotherapy according to their assigned
                dose cohort:

                  -  Cohort 1: Patients undergo thoracic conformal radiotherapy (TCRT) on days
                     1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47. Patients also receive
                     carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 and
                     bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, and 43.

                  -  Cohort 2: Patients undergo TCRT and receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, and
                     bevacizumab as in cohort 1. Patients also receive oral erlotinib
                     hydrochloride on days 2-5, 9-12, 16-19, 23-26, 30-33, 37-40, and 44-47.

                  -  Cohort 3: Patients undergo TCRT and receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, and
                     bevacizumab as in cohort 1. Patients also receive higher doses of oral
                     erlotinib hydrochloride on days 2-5, 9-12, 16-19, 23-26, 30-33, 37-40, and
                     44-47.

      Cohorts of 5 patients receive chemoradiotherapy as described above until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      (with grade 4 toxicity) or 3 (with grade 3 toxicity) of 5 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity.

      Three to 6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients proceed to consolidation
      therapy.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive bevacizumab IV on day 1 and oral erlotinib
           hydrochloride on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Phase II:

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive induction therapy as in phase I (closed to accrual
           as of 1/3/2008).

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients undergo TCRT and receive carboplatin and paclitaxel as in
           phase I (closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008). Patients also receive bevacizumab and
           erlotinib hydrochloride as in phase I (closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008) at the
           MTD/drug combination determined in phase I (closed to accrual as of 1/3/2008).

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive consolidation therapy as in phase I (closed to
           accrual as of 1/3/2008).

      Tumor tissue and peripheral blood is collected at baseline for future correlative and
      biomarker studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 4
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
