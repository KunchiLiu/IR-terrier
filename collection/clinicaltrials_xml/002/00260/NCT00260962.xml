  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of an anti-psychotic medication,
      Olanzapine, in achieving desired weight gain in patients identified as having Anorexia
      Nervosa, either restricting or binge/purge subtype. The study will also evaluate the
      possible beneficial effects of Olanzapine in reducing the severity of the obsessive and/or
      anxiety symptoms associated with this disorder.
