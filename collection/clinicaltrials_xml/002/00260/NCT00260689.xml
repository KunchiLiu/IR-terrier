  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a life-threatening bone marrow failure disorder
      characterized by pancytopenia and a hypocellular bone marrow. Allogeneic bone marrow
      transplantation offers the opportunity for cure in 70% of patients, but most patients are
      not suitable candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) due to advanced
      age or lack of a histocompatible donor. For these patients, comparable long term survival is
      attainable with immunosuppressive treatment with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and
      cyclosporine (CsA). However, of those patients treated with horse ATG(h-ATG)/CsA, one
      quarter to one third will not respond, and about 50% of responders relapse. Auto-reactive T
      cells may be resistant to the effect of ATG/CsA (non-responders), while in others residual
      auto-reactive T cells expand post-treatment, leading to hematopoietic stem cell destruction
      and recurrent pancytopenia (relapse). As long term survival is correlated to response rates
      and robustness of hematopoietic recovery, novel immunosuppressive regimens that can achieve
      hematologic response and decrease relapse rates are needed.

      This trial will compare the effectiveness of three immunosuppressive regimens as first line
      therapies in patients with SAA with early hematologic response as the primary endpoint, as
      well as assess the role of extended CsA treatment after h-ATG in reducing numbers of late
      events of relapse and clonal evolution. Randomization is employed to obtain an equal
      distribution of subject to each arm; comparisons of early hematologic responses will be made
      among the rates observed among the three concurrent arms (rabbit-ATG [r-ATG] versus standard
      h-ATG; alemtuzumab vs standard h-ATG). For long course CSA, comparison of primary end points
      will be to well established historic relapse rate of 38% at 2-3 years and a cumulative rate
      of clonal evolution of 15%.

      In the original design subjects were randomized to one of three different regimens: h-ATG +
      6 months CsA followed by an 18 month CsA taper; r-ATG + 6 months CsA; or alemtuzumab
      (Campath). Subjects failing to respond to r-ATG will be crossed over to alemtuzumab
      (Campath), and subjects failing alemtuzumab (Campath) will be crossed over to r-ATG.
      Subjects failing to respond to h-ATG + CsA taper will go off study and be evaluated for
      eligibility for a second course of immunosuppression on companion protocol 03-H-0249, which
      similarly randomizes subjects between r-ATG and alemtuzumab (Campath) as salvage therapy.

      The Campath arm closed to new accrual for lack of efficacy on 4/10/2008. New accruals will
      be randomized to h-ATG + 6 months CsA followed by an 18 month CsA taper or r-ATG + 6 months
      CsA. Subjects failing to respond to r-ATG will continue to be crossed over to alemtuzumab
      (Campath ). Subjects failing to respond to h-ATG + CsA taper will go off study and be
      evaluated for eligibility for a second course of immunosuppression on companion protocol
      03-H-0249, which similarly randomizes subjects between r-ATG and alemtuzumab (Campath ) as
      salvage therapy.

      The primary endpoint will be hematologic respnse, defined as no longer meeting criteria for
      SAA, at 6 months. Secondary endpoints are relapse, robustness of hematologic recovery at 6
      months, response at 3 and 12 months, survival, clonal evolution to PNH, myelodysplasia and
      acute leukemia. Long-course CSA will be assessed separately for its efficacy in reducing
      late events of relapse and evolution by comparison to historical control data.

          5. Serologic evidence of HIV infection.

          6. Failure to discontinue the herbal supplements Echinacea purpurea or Usnea barbata
             (Old Man's Beard) within 2 weeks of enrollment.

          7. Moribund status or concurrent hepatic, renal, cardiac, neurologic, pulmonary,
             infectious, or metabolic disease of such severity that it would preclude the
             patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy, or that death within 7-10 days is
             likely.

          8. Potential subjects with cancer who are on active chemotherapeutic treatment or who
             take drugs with hematological effects will not be eligible.

          9. Current pregnancy, or unwillingness to take oral contraceptives or refrain from
             pregnancy if of childbearing potential.

         10. Not able to understand the investigational nature of the study or give informed
             consent.
