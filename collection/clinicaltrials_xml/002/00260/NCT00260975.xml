    <textblock>
      Many breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy complain of problems with
      concentration and memory. This has been referred to as &quot;chemo fog&quot;. The current study is
      investigating this phenomenon by measuring patients' mental function prior to and after
      exposure to chemotherapy, and by comparing mental function in those patients who receive
      chemotherapy and those who do not.

      Many breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy complain of problems with
      concentration and memory. This has been referred to as &quot;chemo fog&quot;. The current study will
      investigate this phenomenon by measuring neuropsychological functioning in early stage
      breast cancer patients prior to and after exposure to chemotherapy, and by comparing change
      in cognitive function in these patients who receive chemotherapy to similar breast cancer
      patients receiving hormonal therapy only, and to healthy women without breast cancer.
