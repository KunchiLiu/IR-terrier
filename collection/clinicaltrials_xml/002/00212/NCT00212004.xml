    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease and
      atherosclerotic change in coronary artery. So we designed a prospective randomized
      multi-center trial named the pioglitazone could reduce the recurrence of myocardial
      infarction in patients with DM and myocardial infarction(PPAR study) to evaluate whether
      pioglitazone could reduce the recurrence of myocardial infarction in patients with
      DM(HbA1c&lt;6.5%) and myocardial infarction.

      100 hospitals will participate in the PPAR study. Patients with DM who have history of prior
      myocardial infarction are randomly allocated to receive pioglitazone or (1)instructs weight
      reduction, appropriate diet, regular exercise and/or (2)prescribes sulfonylurea agents. The
      number of patients to be recruited is 3000 and this study will continue at least 2 years.
      The primary end-points are (1) cardiovascular mortality and (2) hospitalization for
      cardiovascular events. Effects in suppression of new diabetes development also will be
      evaluated.

      We should recognize DM as important therapeutic target to decrease recurrence of
      cardiovascular events. PPAR study, a large scale multi-center trial in Japan, will provide
      us new evidence how to treat DM patients with prior myocardial infarction.
