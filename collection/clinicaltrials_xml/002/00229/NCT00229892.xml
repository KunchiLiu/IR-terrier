      The purpose is to evaluate the investigators' length of incisions based on patient weight,
      operative times, hospital lengths of stay, pain medicine requirements, complications and
      costs. These data will lead to a new minimally invasive standard of care without a reduction
      in outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a trend in surgery, in general, toward minimal invasion. This includes the
      transition to laparoscopy/thoracoscopy from open procedures, as well as the reduction in
      incision size for open procedures. The goal of minimally invasive techniques is to reduce
      morbidity and length of hospital stay, with a consequent reduction in hospital cost.

      There are few cardiac operations that are currently performed with minimally invasive
      techniques. One of these is the repair of an atrial septal defect, which can be performed
      though a small skin incision and partial rather than full sternotomy. Another is the
      ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus, which can be performed through a muscle-sparing
      thoracotomy rather than a full thoracotomy.

      Both of these techniques minimize the scarring and the healing time required for
      post-operative recovery. We need to be confident that it has not affected our outcomes
      adversely. We need to evaluate our length of incisions based on patient weight, operative
      times, hospital lengths of stay, pain medicine requirements, complications and costs.

      Hopefully, these data will lead to a new minimally invasive standard of care without a
      reduction in outcomes.

      We will review charts before November 1, 2004 at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.
