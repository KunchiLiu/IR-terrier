      medication treatment or placebo for prevention of recurrence of depression for 24 months
      after termination of continuation phase therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious medical illness that is often difficult to diagnose and treat. It
      often recurs more than once in a person's lifetime. Effective treatment methods are needed
      to prevent the relapse in people who have had prior episodes of depression. CT is a
      short-term talking therapy that focuses on changing negative thinking patterns and helping
      patients develop coping skills to deal with their experiences. Evidence suggests that CT is
      effective in treating a number of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety and anger. This
      study will determine the effectiveness of booster sessions of CT versus antidepressant
      medication in preventing relapse of depression in people at risk for recurrent depression.

      All participants in this double blind study will first receive 16 to 20 sessions of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy over 12 weeks. Participants who respond to the treatment, but
      do not achieve full remission of depressive symptoms, will be considered to be at risk for
      relapse. They will be randomly assigned to receive 10 booster sessions of one of three
      treatments over 8 months: cognitive-behavioral therapy, fluoxetine, or placebo. The booster
      sessions will take place twice monthly for the first 2 months and once monthly for the next
      6 months. All participants who complete the entire 8 months of the study will be followed-up
      for an additional 2 years to monitor depressive relapse and psychosocial functioning.
