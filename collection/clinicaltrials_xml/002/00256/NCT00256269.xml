  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of cisplatin and irinotecan has significant anti-tumor activity in
      esophageal cancer. Oxaliplatin has been shown to have activity in combination with 5 FU and
      radiation in treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. Oxaliplatin also has better
      side effects profile than cisplatin and may be able to overcome tumors that have developed
      cisplatin resistance. The standard treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer has been
      cisplatin, 5FU and radiation followed by possible esophagectomy. However, a large portion of
      these patients will relapse and the tumor may develop resistance to cisplatin and/or the
      cumulative toxicity from previous treatment forbids the use of cisplatin again. Weekly
      combination of oxaliplatin and irinotecan has been shown to be active and well tolerated in
      elderly population with refractory colorectal cancer. Therefore, we propose this phase II
      trial of a weekly oxaliplatin and irinotecan to test the effectiveness and the tolerability
      of this regimen in metastatic and/or recurrent esophageal cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
             squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Patients with tumors of
             the gastroesophageal junction were eligible if at least 50% of the tumor involved the
             esophagus.

          -  Patients must have locally advanced (i.e. unresectable) or metastatic disease

          -  All sites of disease must be assessed and designated as measurable or non-measurable
             disease as documented by CT, MRI, X-ray physical Each of the criteria in the
             following section must be met in order for a patient to be eligible for registration.

          -  Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy for chemotherapy for advanced or
             metastatic esophageal cancer. Chemotherapy given adjuvantly or as a radiosensitizer
             is allowed if more than 8 weeks have elapsed since the treatment was completed and
             they have recovered from any treatment related toxicity.

          -  Patients may have received prior radiotherapy if there has been complete recovery
             from all radiation-induced toxicities. At least 4 weeks must have been elapsed from
             the completion of radiation therapy to the time of registration. If lesions within
             the radiation port are to be used to assess response to therapy, those lesions must
             have demonstrated clear progression by the criteria outlined in Section 10.2d
             following completion of radiation therapy.

          -  Patients must not have a surgical procedure for esophageal cancer within 4 weeks
             prior to registration. Patients must have completely recovered from all surgery prior
             to registration.

          -  All patients must be 18 years of age or older

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance of 0-2

          -  Patients with any evidence of active or uncontrolled infection, recent myocardial
             infection, unstable angina, or life-threatening arrhythmia are not eligible.

          -  Patients with severe psychiatric disorder are not eligible.

          -  Patients with known brain metastasis are not eligible. However, brain-imaging studies
             are not required for eligibility if the patient has no neurological signs or
             symptoms. If brain-imaging studies are performed, they must be negative for disease.

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma, in situ cervical cancer, or adequately treated Stage I and
             II cancer from which the patient is in complete remission, or any other malignancy
             from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years.

          -  Patients should not have active infection.

          -  Patients should not have psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical
             conditions that do not permit medical follow-up and compliance with study protocol.

          -  Except for cancer-related abnormalities, patients should not have unstable or
             pre-existing major medical conditions.

          -  Patients should not have any immediate life-threatening complications of their
             malignancies.
