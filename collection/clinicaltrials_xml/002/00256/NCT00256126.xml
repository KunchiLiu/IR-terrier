      The study aims at identifying the predictive markers after one month of Saizen therapy in
      Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) and Turner Syndrome children. The study will recruit
      approximately 360 children in several countries worldwide. The study lasts for about the
      first one month of daily growth hormone treatment. There will be three clinic visits during
      the month of the study. There is an initial visit, then a visit before growth hormone
      treatment starts and finally a visit at the fourth week of treatment. The study requires two
      additional blood tests to a regular Saizen treatment follow-up. One sample is taken before
      growth hormone injections start and one additional blood sample is taken at the fourth week
      of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One of the following diagnoses and candidacy for SAIZEN® therapy:

        A)GHD: documented pre-established diagnosis of GHD with a GH peak response of &lt;10 μg/L
        with 2 GH stimulation tests, without priming with oestradiol.

        B)Turner syndrome: documented pre-established diagnosis by karyotype.

          -  Prepubertal status according to Tanner Pre-established history of normal thyroid
             function or adequate substitution for at least 3 months.

          -  Weight for stature within the population specific normal range (&gt;5th and &lt;95th
             percentiles) for gender Willingness and ability to comply with the protocol for the

             understanding that the subject or parent/guardian may withdraw consent at any time
             without prejudice to future medical care. If the child is old enough to read and

             stable for at least 3 months.

          -  Severe associated pathology affecting growth such as malnutrition, malabsorption, or
             bone dysplasia.

          -  Acute or severe illness during the previous 6 months.

          -  Significant concomitant illness that would interfere with participation or assessment
             in this study.

          -  Active malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin malignancies that have undergone
             surgical excision and/or biopsy, diagnosis and treatment to resolution)

          -  History or active Idiopathic intra-cranial hypertension (benign intracranial
             hypertension or pseudo-tumor cerebri).

          -  Diabetes Mellitus type I &amp; II.

          -  Any autoimmune disease.
