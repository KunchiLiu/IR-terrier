  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to collect blood and bone marrow samples for biologic studies of
      antibody producing cells. Donor specific antibodies can cause damage to the kidneys after
      they are transplanted. The study will look at the impact of immunosuppression on antibody
      production by antibody producing cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone marrow and blood samples from both non-sensitized kidney transplant recipients and
      sensitized kidney transplant recipients will be collected. The samples will be used to
      compare the effect immunosuppression has on the antibody producing cells from both of these
      kinds of transplant recipients. Bone marrow will be collected from sensitized kidney
      transplant recipients before desensitization therapy prior to transplantation and at the
      time of kidney transplant surgery. Non-sensitized patients will have bone marrow collected
      only at the time of kidney transplant surgery. Blood will be collected at the same time
      point that the marrow is collected in both kinds of patients.

        Three groups will be studied:

          1. Non-sensitized renal allograft candidates prior to any therapy;

          2. High DSA recipients--Recipients with a positive T or B cell cytotoxicity crossmatch
             or a B cell flow cytometric crossmatch assay with a channel shift &gt;350 at baseline
             against their living donor at baseline and

          3. Low DSA recipientsâ€”recipients with a negative T and B cell cytotoxicity assay, but a
             positive T or B cell flow cytometric crossmatch with a B cell channel shift &lt;350.
