  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall design of the study is to perform both a PET and MRI scan on objectively
      identified borderline personality disorder patients, to treat them with olanzapine for 8
      weeks, and to then re-scan the patients with PET.

      The primary objective of this proposed study will be to compare the baseline PET scan to the
      endpoint scan in 15 BPD patients who have been treated with olanzapine. The comparison of
      the scans will be done through a statistical image analysis, using a pixel-by-pixel group
      mean subtraction strategy with appropriate correction for multiple comparisons. In an
      exploratory fashion we will compare frontal and temporal regions of interest to address
      hypotheses of which areas of the brain might show changes with olanzapine treatment.

      A secondary objective is to use a normal database to compare the baseline PET scan of the 15
      patients in a medication free state to normal subjects. The advantage of this strategy is
      the ability to closely match subjects by gender and age. As noted earlier, Dr. Pardo has
      data on 35 control subjects studied on the same scanner we plan to use for this study.
