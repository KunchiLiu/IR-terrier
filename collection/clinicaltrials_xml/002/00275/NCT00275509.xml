  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the anti-T cell antibody, Thymoglobulin is
      a more effective induction medication than the anti-IL-2R inhibitor daclizumab, in kidney
      transplant recipients who have a positive crossmatch with their live donor.

    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is widely recognized as the optimal therapy for the management of
      end-stage renal disease. Presently, the deceased donor kidney waiting list has expanded
      disproportionately with the number of transplant procedures that are performed in the United
      States. To further compound this problem, as many as 1/3 of the patients on this list are
      highly sensitized against a broad range of potential donors.

      In order to address this problem, we developed an antibody depletion protocol that permits
      transplantation in patients who have a positive crossmatch with their live donor. The
      protocol consists of standard immunosuppressant therapy, plasmapheresis, and intravenous
      immunoglobulin infusion. We have successfully performed transplantation in over 100 such
      patients with low complication rates.

      Because these patients have been exposed to their donor's HLA antigen they are at high risk
      for both acute cellular and acute antibody-mediated rejection. This intent of this
      prospective, randomized, open-label trial is to determine whether induction therapy (i.e.
      therapy given at the time of transplantation for prophylaxis) with Thymoglobulin is
      associated with a lower 6-month incidence of acute cellular and antibody-mediated rejection
      than with our standard therapy, daclizumab.
