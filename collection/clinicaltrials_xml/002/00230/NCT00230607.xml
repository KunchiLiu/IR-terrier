      The purpose of this study is to observe the potential effects of Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta)
      treatment on lactation and on the growth, development, and immunologic response of infants
      born to mothers with Fabry disease who are treated with Fabrazyme during lactation. There
      are 3 participation scenarios: mother/infant full participation, mother full
      participation/infant development assessment only, and mother full participation/infant no
      participation. Whether or not the mother continues to lactate will be assessed at each
      visit. If the mother is no longer lactating, the mother will discontinue this study but
      continue to be followed in the Fabry Registry. The infant (if participating) will be
      followed for development only for the remainder of this 24 month study.
