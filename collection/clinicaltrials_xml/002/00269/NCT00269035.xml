      This study is being conducted in 2 groups of schizophrenic patients: in group 1 the
      relationship between the dopaminergic D2 receptor occupancy (D2 RO ) and serotoninergic
      5HT2A receptor occupancy at stable plasma concentration (Cp) of SB-773812 will be
      investigated using SPECT scan in up to 15 chronic schizophrenic patients in an open- label
      design. In group 2 up to 80 patients will receive SB-773812 or Risperidone for 6 weeks to
      obtain at least 10 patients showing clinical improvement with SB-773812. The relationship of
      D2 RO, measured at steady state after chronic dosing at Cmax (6+/-2 h) and Ctrough (24+/-4
      h), and PK at steady state after repeated doses, to efficacy readouts will be investigated.
      The SB-773812 dose administered will be selected as the highest dose proven to be safe and
      well tolerated from a previous study.
