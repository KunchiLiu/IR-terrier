  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the effects of a soy supplement called Revival on memory, quality of
      life, and hot flashes in men with prostate cancer who are being treated with testosterone
      suppression therapy. Hypothesis: Treating men who have prostate CA with daily Revival will
      result in at least a 50% reduction in hot flashes compared to placebo.

      This research study will look at the effects of a soy supplement called Revival on memory,
      quality of life, and hot flashes in men with prostate cancer who are undergoing (ADT)
      androgen deprivation therapy. Participants will be given either placebo or Revival.
      Participants will be asked to take their supplement once/day for 14 weeks.Blood will be
      drawn to check on liver, kidney, thyroid, cholesterol,and prostate health. Urine will be
      collected to check on bone markers. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires to
      test memory, attention span, and vocabulary.Possible benefits may include increase in
      memory, decrease in hot flashes, and a general increase in quality of life.
