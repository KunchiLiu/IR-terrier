  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent reports have shown that people with asthma who have a particular gene, known as the
      GSTM1 null gene, are more susceptible to the effect of air pollutants. The purpose of this
      research study is to learn if volunteers who have asthma and have a GSTM1 null gene have
      increased response (change in lung function and increase in lung cells collected from
      sputum) compared to volunteers with asthma who have the GSTM1 sufficient gene when
      challenged with 0.4 ppm ozone during intermittent exercise. The principal purpose of this
      study is to identify hyper-responsive, responsive and non-responsive groups of human
      subjects with mild asthma based on their airway neutrophilic response to ozone exposure, and
      to perform analyses on DNA from airway cells to explore possible differences in genetic
      profiles between the three groups. An additional pilot aim is to compare expression of a
      small number of specific genes of interest in a subset of ozone-responsive and
      ozone-non-responsive subjects with mild asthma.

      Fifty volunteers with mild asthma will be recruited to undergo ozone challenge in the
      controlled exposure facility of the US EPA Human Studies Division (104 Mason Farm Road,
      Chapel Hill, NC) with 0.4ppm for 2 hours with moderate exercise alternating with rest.
      Endpoints will include genetic analysis for the GSTM1 genotype, sputum and spirometry
      changes pre and post exposure, and blood endpoints pre and post exposure.

      TRAINING DAY: (at least 3 days prior to the ozone challenge) Eligible subjects will report
      to the research lab for a 3 hour training session.

        -  All female volunteers will undergo a urine pregnancy test.

        -  After informed consent is obtained, Measurement of orally exhaled nitric oxide will be
           obtained

        -  Subjects will perform spirometry.

        -  Subjects will exercise on a treadmill to determine the workload for the actual
           exposure.

        -  Finally the subject will undergo sputum induction following pretreatment with
           albuterol.

      The sputum will be assessed for quality to determine continued eligibility. If a subject has
      provided an acceptable sputum sample within the prior 6 months this may be used as inclusion
      criteria rather than repeating the induction at this point. After subjects have demonstrated
      production of an adequate sputum sample, they will be scheduled for the ozone exposure
      visit.

      24 HOURS PRIOR to the exposure day (Day 1): Subjects will be asked to refrain from smoking
      as well as drinking alcohol for 24 hours prior to Day 1 until after completion of Day 3.

        -  Subjects will have vital signs and oxygen saturation checked, including the symptom
           questionnaire.

        -  They will also undergo a physical examination of the ears, nose, throat and chest (lung
           sounds).

        -  Female volunteers will undergo urine pregnancy testing.

        -  Measurement of orally exhaled nitric oxide will be obtained.

        -  Spirometry testing will be performed.

        -  Subjects will have a sputum induction preceded by administration of 2 puffs of
           albuterol.

      EXPOSURE DAY (at least 3 days after the training day):

        -  Subjects will be asked to arrive at the study site at approximately 8 AM and will
           undergo assessment of vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood
           pressure), oxygen saturation, and symptom score assessment.

        -  A telemetry unit will be placed for cardiac monitoring during the exposure.

        -  Measurement of orally exhaled nitric oxide will be obtained prior to exposure and 4
           hours after the end of the exposure

        -  Spirometry testing to rule out acute illness prior to the exposure.

        -  They will also undergo a physical examination of the ears, nose, throat and chest.

        -  Exposure sessions: The 0.4 ppm ozone exposure will be conducted in an ozone exposure
           chamber. Each subject will be exposed to 0.4 ppm ozone for 2 hours. During exposures,
           subjects will perform four 15 minute bouts of moderate exercise (minute ventilation or
           VE = 30 40 L/min) on a treadmill, each separated by 15 minutes of seated rest. Minute
           ventilation is measured for 2 to 3 minutes after about 4 minutes of exercise during the
           first exercise period, and again at about 12 minutes of exercise. It is then measured
           at about 12 minutes into each exercise period. Two subjects may be exposed
           simultaneously, in which case the exercise/rest periods will be alternated.

        -  Immediately post exposure and 4 hours after completion of exposure, subjects will have
           an assessment of vital signs, oxygen saturation, symptom score assessment and undergo
           spirometry evaluation.

        -  Venipuncture: 20 ml of blood will be collected for a CBC/ differential, assessment of
           blood monocyte phagocytic function and cell surface markers just prior to the exposure
           and 4 hours after the end of exposure. A portion of the sample will be used for
           genotyping.

        -  Induced sputum will be collected 6 hours after initiation of exposure after subjects
           have been premedicated with albuterol. The subjects will be observed at the study site
           until sputum induction is complete. Subjects will not be discharged home following the
           post-exposure sputum induction until FEV1 is within 90% of baseline values and vital
           signs are normal. Subjects not meeting safety criteria at the end of the exposure day
           will be admitted to the GCRC for overnight observation.

           24 HOURS POST EXPOSURE (Day 3): The following morning, approximately 24 hours after
           exposure, the volunteer subject will be assessed directly at the study site. The
           subject will undergo spirometry, vital sign monitoring and symptom scoring.

      STUDY DISCONTINUATION VISIT (5-10 days after exposure): The volunteer subject will again be
      assessed directly at the study site. The subject will undergo spirometry, vital sign
      monitoring and symptom scoring.

             normal lung function must be obtained.

          -  Unspecified illnesses, which in the judgment of the investigator might increase the
             risk associated with ozone inhalation challenge, will be a basis for exclusion.

          -  Use of inhaled steroids, cromolyn or leukotriene inhibitors initiated within the past
             month (except for use of cromolyn exclusively prior to exercise). Patients must be on
             a stable regimen of therapy.

          -  Pregnancy or nursing a baby.

          -  Nighttime symptoms of cough or wheeze greater than 1x/week at baseline (not during a
             clearly recognized viral induced asthma exacerbation) which would be characteristic
             of a person of moderate or severe persistent asthma as outlined in the current NHLBI
             guidelines for diagnosis and management of asthma.

          -  Exacerbation of asthma more than 2x/week which would be characteristic of a person
             with moderate or severe persistent asthma as outlined in the current NHLBI guidelines
             for diagnosis and management of asthma.

          -  Daily requirement for albuterol due to asthma symptoms (cough, wheeze, chest
             tightness) which would be characteristic of a person of moderate or severe persistent
             asthma as outlined in the current NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and management of
             asthma. (Not to include prophylactic use of albuterol prior to exercise).

          -  Dosing level of an inhaled steroid must be consistent with mild episodic asthma as
             outlined by the NHLBI NAEPP guidelines. Use of inhaled steroid at doses typically
             used for moderate or severe asthma will result in exclusion of that individual from
             the protocol.
