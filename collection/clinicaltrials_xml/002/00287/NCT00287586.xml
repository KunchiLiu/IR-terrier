    <textblock>
      As men grow older, their testosterone levels decrease with age. One-third of men, 70 years
      of age or older, have low testosterone levels. It is known that short-term testosterone
      replacement is safe, and can increase muscle strength and physical function, but the risks
      of long-term testosterone replacement in older men with low testosterone levels are
      incompletely understood.

      Atherosclerosis is characterized by thickening of the artery walls, and the narrowing of the
      blood vessels as cholesterol is deposited in the lining of the arteries. It is the major
      cause of cardiovascular disease including ischemic heart disease (heart attacks) and stroke.
      Although, historically, there has been a widespread perception that higher levels of
      testosterone might increase the risk of atherosclerosis, the evidence from research does not
      support this. In observational studies, higher testosterone levels have been correlated with
      more favorable cardiovascular risk factors, and supplementation with testosterone to bring
      older men into the normal range for healthy younger men appears to improve several
      cardiovascular risk factors, and may slow the progression of atherosclerosis.

      The primary purpose of this study is to look at the effects of testosterone replacement on
      the progression of atherosclerosis in older men. This study is also being done to find out
      whether replacement with testosterone in older men with low testosterone levels improves
      their health-related quality of life.

      Although short-term administration of testosterone in replacement doses is relatively safe,
      the risks of long-term testosterone administration in older men remain poorly understood.
      The two major areas of concern include the potential for increased risk of atherosclerotic
      heart disease and exacerbation of a pre-existing, subclinical prostate cancer (1-3). There
      is a widespread perception that testosterone supplementation adversely affects plasma
      lipoprotein profile and increases the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease; this premise is
      not supported by data (4). Thus, the long-term consequences of testosterone supplementation
      on the risk of atherosclerosis progression remain unknown. While supraphysiological doses of
      testosterone and non-aromatizable androgens frequently employed by body-builders undoubtedly
      decrease plasma HDL-cholesterol levels (5-9), physiologic testosterone replacement in older
      men has been associated with only a modest or no decrease in plasma HDL-cholesterol (10-13).
      Cross-sectional studies of middle-aged men (14-16) find a direct, rather than an inverse,
      relationship between serum testosterone levels and plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations as
      well as an inverse correlation between serum testosterone levels and visceral fat volume.
      Testosterone supplementation of middle-aged men with truncal obesity is associated with a
      reduction in visceral fat volume, serum glucose concentration, blood pressure, and an
      improvement in insulin sensitivity (17-19). All of these changes are associated with lower
      risk for atherosclerosis. These data suggest that serum testosterone levels in the range
      that is mid-normal for healthy young men are consistent with an optimal cardiovascular risk
      profile at any age, and that testosterone concentrations either above or below the
      physiologic male range may increase the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease. Studies in a
      LDL-receptor deficient mice provide compelling evidence that testosterone retards early
      atherogenesis, and that testosterone effects on atherogenesis are mediated through its
      conversion to estradiol by the action of aromatase enzyme that is expressed in the vessel
      wall. The effects of testosterone replacement on cardiovascular risk in humans have never
      been directly examined. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to examine
      directly the effects of testosterone replacement on atherosclerosis progression in men by
      measuring common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA IMT) and coronary artery
      calcification (CAC) by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), two independent
      measurements of generalized atherosclerosis.

      The second objective of this study is to determine whether physiologic testosterone
      replacement of older men with low testosterone levels improves health-related quality of
      life. Aging-associated decline in physical, sexual, and cognitive functions contributes to
      diminished quality of life in older men (20-31). Although the pathophysiology of impairment
      in each of these subdomains of health-related quality of life is complex and multifactorial,
      one correctable cause of the diminished quality of life in older men is the decrease in
      serum testosterone concentrations (32-54). Total and free testosterone (T) levels decline
      with advancing age in normal men (13-37), with a significant number of men meeting usual
      criteria for hypogonadism by the sixth to seventh decades (55). Spontaneous (56) and
      experimentally-induced (57) androgen-deficiency in young men is associated with decreased
      muscle mass and strength and impaired sexual function. Because loss of muscle mass and
      function contributes to diminished health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older men,
      anabolic therapies such as testosterone that increase muscle mass and strength, would be
      expected to improve physical function. In older men with low testosterone levels,
      testosterone might also improve sexual function and marital interaction (11-13, 53, 58-62).
      A growing body of literature suggests that testosterone impacts neuronal functioning and may
      affect cognitive performance. Because physical, sexual, and cognitive functions are
      important determinants of health-related quality of life, testosterone replacement of older
      men with low testosterone levels would be expected to improve general health perceptions.

      The aging of humans is a recent evolutionary event. Of the thousand generations of men and
      women who have lived on this planet, only the humans of the last two generations could have
      hoped to live past the age of 50! The population is getting proportionally older. The number
      of people 85 years of age and older today is substantially greater than at the beginning of
      the 20th century. Advancing age is associated with decreased muscle mass and strength, and
      impairment of physical, sexual, and cognitive functions. Diminished muscle mass and strength
      increases the risk of falls, disability and poor quality of life. Age-related impairment of
      sexual and cognitive functions also contributes to overall reduction in quality of life.
      Testosterone replacement, by improving some aspects of physical, sexual and cognitive
      functions, would be expected to improve health-related quality of life.

      Previous studies have established that testosterone replacement in older men with low
      testosterone levels increases muscle mass and strength. However, lack of information in two
      areas has prevented formulation of general recommendations about wider use of testosterone
      replacement in older men. First, the effectiveness of testosterone in improving physical
      function, quality of life, and other health-related outcomes has not been demonstrated.
      Second, while there is agreement that short-term administration of testosterone in
      replacement doses is safe, the long-term risks of testosterone supplementation in older men
      remain unknown. The areas of major concern are the risks of prostate cancer and heart
      disease. Because of the high prevalence, even small increases in the incidence rates of
      atherosclerotic heart disease associated with testosterone supplementation will have
      significant impact on overall morbidity and mortality, and health care costs. The study will
      evaluate one important aspect of the long-term safety of testosterone administration by
      directly examining its effects on the rate of progression of atherosclerosis. If the study
      demonstrates that testosterone retards atherosclerosis progression, then that would provide
      one additional reason for testosterone supplementation of older men with low testosterone
      levels. If the study demonstrates a neutral effect of testosterone on atherosclerosis
      progression, that information would also be reassuring and useful to regulatory agencies.
      This study will establish the efficacy of testosterone replacement in improving physical,
      sexual and cognitive functions that are major determinants of health-related quality of life
      in older men.

      In spite of the paucity of efficacy and safety data, the sales of testosterone and other
      androgenic products have witnessed explosive growth because of increased media attention and
      public interest. During the summer of 2000, testosterone-related stories were on the cover
      of Time, Newsweek, New York Times, and Los Angeles Times! The prescription sales of
      testosterone that had been growing at 25-30% annual rate since 1993, almost doubled in the
      year 2000, and have cumulatively increased 500% since 1993 (Source: IMS Sales Data, provided
      by Reed Selby, Marketing Director for ALZA Corporation). The growing testosterone use in
      older men, without a clear understanding of its benefits or long-term risks, has raised
      concern among regulatory agencies. The proposed study by providing definitive information on
      the effects of testosterone replacement on several measures of efficacy and safety in older
      men would facilitate an analysis of its risk:benefit ratio.
