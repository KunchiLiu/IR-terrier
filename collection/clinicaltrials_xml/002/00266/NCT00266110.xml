      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells may help the body build an
      effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab,
      can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to
      them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      vaccine therapy together with trastuzumab and vinorelbine may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with
      trastuzumab and vinorelbine works in treating patients with locally recurrent or metastatic
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of multiepitope autologous dendritic cell vaccine in combination
           with trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and vinorelbine ditartrate in patients with locally
           recurrent or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2/neu.

      Secondary

        -  Determine if this regimen is effective in generating functional antigen-specific T
           cells.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Therapeutic autologous dendritic cell (DC) preparation: Patients undergo mobilization
           of DC and apheresis for production of therapeutic DC. DCs are expanded in vitro for
           10-20 days and pulsed with E75 and E90 peptides.

        -  Treatment: Patients receive vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 6-10 minutes, therapeutic
           autologous DC intradermally over 2-5 minutes, and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over
           30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days
           2, 4, and 6, or until neutrophil counts recover. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up
           to 6 courses (or more at the discretion of the investigator) in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

If the subject is currently receiving Trastuzumab, the first study infusion will be given at 4mg/kg over 30 minutes. Subsequently, Trastuzumab will be infused at 4 mg/kg in the side-port of a freely flowing IV over 30 minutes.</description>
