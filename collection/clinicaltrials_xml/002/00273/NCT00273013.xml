  <official_title>A Two-centre, Randomised, Double-blind, Double-dummy, Placebo-controlled, 3-period Cross-over Study to Evaluate the Effect of Treatment With Repeat Doses of GW274150 on the Allergen-induced Late Asthmatic Response in Subjects With Mild Asthma.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study investigating whether 14 days of dosing with GW274150 has a beneficial
      effect on a model of asthma type inflammation called the allergen-induced late asthmatic
      response. This will be compared with the response after treatment with a dummy (placebo) and
      a tablet treatment for asthma called Singulair (montelukast). Subjects in the study will
      receive all 3 treatments in a random order. The study is double-blind so subjects will not
      know which treatment they are taking at any given time.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Mild asthma: taking reliever medication (e.g. salbutamol) only.

          -  Screening involves measuring responses to the lung challenge agents: allergen, AMP,
             and methacholine. Only those with specific types of response to these will be
             eligible for the study.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Recent steroid treatment.

          -  Significant illnesses or diseases other than asthma.
