    <textblock>
      Sometimes blood levels of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) will rise in men who have had
      prostate surgery or received radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. A low value
      for the PSA is more desirable as is may indicate no tumor growth. Giving the hormone therapy
      intermittently (in cycles of treatment and off treatment periods) appears to delay the
      change of prostate cancer to a type of prostate cancer that resists hormone therapy. If it
      does, the prostate cancer will be treatable for a longer period of time, as well as improve
      the quality of life. Mental functioning is monitored during therapy to see if this treatment
      has any impact on memory or ability to carry out tasks. In addition, extra tubes of blood
      are obtained to test for Amyloid-B protein (AB protein) whose presence may be associated
      with problem solving decline.

      This study evaluates the effect of intermittent androgen suppression on time to androgen
      independent progression and overall survival in men with localized prostate cancer. Subjects
      will also be evaluated for the effects of intermittent androgen suppression on quality of
      life and on musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric systems.

      The subjects in this study will have a rising PSA value after definitive therapy either with
      radical prostatectomy or external beam irradiation for the treatment of prostate cancer. All
      subjects will be male, and they will be over the age of 18 years.

      New subjects will be introduced to this study protocol (along with other non-study treatment
      options) during a clinic visit with Dr. Higano or another sub-investigator. If informed
      consent is obtained, subjects will undergo the following screening procedures before
      starting treatment: Bone density scan; bone scan; CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis;
      blood draw; problem solving test; quality of life and emotion questionnaires; and a body
      composition test. Subjects will then begin androgen suppression with a two-week lead-in of
      flutamide, followed by 9 monthly injections of leuprolide acetate. During the treatment,
      they will have quarterly clinic visits and blood draws for hematology, chemistry, liver
      function, and lipids. Their PSA levels are monitored monthly, and if their PSA reaches the
      appropriate nadir at by month 9, the androgen suppression is interrupted. At the end of each
      treatment cycle, subjects will undergo another bone density test, blood draw, body
      composition test, problem solving test, and complete the quality of life and emotion
      questionnaires.

      During the &quot;off treatment&quot; phase, the subject will again have quarterly clinic visits, blood
      draw for chemistry, hematology, liver function, and lipids, as well as having quarterly
      cognitive function test. PSA and testosterone will be monitored monthly. Once the PSA
      reaches the appropriate threshold, the subject will perform another set of screening
      procedures and resume treatment for another 9 months. This cycle continues until the patient
      withdraws from the study, is taken off the study due to toxicities or the decision of the
      investigator, or if the treatment is no longer effective in controlling the prostate cancer.
      The problem solving tests are only performed during the subject's first cycle of treatment
      (consisting of the 9 months on treatment, and the entire off treatment period afterwards).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biochemical relapse (rising PSA) after initial treatment (radiation therapy,
