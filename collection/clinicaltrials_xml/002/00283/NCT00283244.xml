      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine and erlotinib are more effective when given
      alone or together in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying gemcitabine and erlotinib to compare how
      well they work when given alone or together as first-line therapy in treating older patients
      with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival rate of older patients with stage IIIB or IV
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride vs erlotinib
           hydrochloride vs gemcitabine hydrochloride and erlotinib hydrochloride as first-line
           therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients receiving these regimens.

        -  Determine the overall survival rate in patients receiving these regimens.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients receiving these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, parallel group, multicenter study.
      Patients are stratified by gender, smoking status (never or light vs current or former), and
      ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 8. Patients with
           progressive disease may cross over to arm II.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily on days 1-21.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride as in arm I and erlotinib
           hydrochloride as in arm II.

      In all arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for 3 years.

    <description>We would consider the combination of gemcitabine plus erlotinib or single agent erlotinib to be worthy of further study if there was an increased progressed-free survival. We would use an increase to 45% progression-free survival at 6 months as significant</description>
