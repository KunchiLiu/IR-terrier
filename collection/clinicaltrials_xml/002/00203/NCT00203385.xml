      The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of divalproex sodium (Depakote)
      in the continuation treatment of PTSD.

      Patients who have participated in the 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      treatment trial of divalproex for PTSD and have signed informed consent will be enrolled in
      a 24-week open-label divalproex continuation phase trial. Patients’ symptoms, side effects
      and compliance will be assessed every two weeks for 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks, thereafter,
      up to 24-weeks. Based on symptomology and occurrence of side effects, the investigator will
      titrate the medication in 500 mg (one tablet) increments every four days, as tolerated,
      until a maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved, not to exceed 3000 mg/day. The dosing is
      twice daily, with the higher dose at bedtime. Compliance will be assessed by monthly pill
      count and valproic acid levels at the week(s) 4, 12 and 24. Patients are given supportive
      clinical management during the clinic visits. An investigator is available by telephone 24
      hrs a day in case of emergency. Patients may be seen more often if needed. Efficacy will be
      measured by the structured rating scales for depression, global function and assessment and
      PTSD. Results of this study will be used to evaluate the long-term efficacy of divalproex in
      the maintenance treatment of PTSD.
