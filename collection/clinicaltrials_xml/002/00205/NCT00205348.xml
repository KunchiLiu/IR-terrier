    <textblock>
      To date, there have been no comprehensive studies on swallowing function in patients
      undergoing surgery for multinodular goiter. We hypothesize that 1. Multinodular goiter has
      significant effect on swallowing function in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which
      can be demonstrated by a standardized questionnaire and a formal swallowing evaluation and
      2. Surgery will improve swallowing function as measured post-operatively by these same
      parameters. Patients with multinodular goiter will be asked to fill out a validated survey
      (SWAL-QOL) on swallowing function in addition to undergoing a formal swallowing evaluation
      before and after surgery for multinodular goiter (subtotal thyroidectomy) and compared to
      patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for follicular cancer and less extensive thyroid
      surgery for other benign processes (lobectomy or lobectomy plus isthmusectomy).
