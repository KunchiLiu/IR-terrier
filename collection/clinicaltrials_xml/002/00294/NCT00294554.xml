  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the usefulness of memantine, compared to placebo
      (sugar pill), for the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with idiopathic
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia. Memantine is used as a safe and effective treatment
      for patients with Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive impairment includes concentration and
      memory difficulties. We will look at how well this medication helps your cognitive
      impairment, how well you tolerate this medication (including its effects on your motor
      symptoms of PD) your activities of daily living, your emotions, and any medical conditions
      you might have. We will interview a person you choose as your &quot;informant&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, double-blind 24-week prospective study
      of memantine at the dosage range 5-20 mg/day in 20 outpatients with idiopathic PD and
      dementia secondary to PD. Using the dosage escalation regimen approved for Alzheimer
      disease, subjects will start memantine or comparable placebo at 5 mg daily and advance 5
      mg/week to 20 mg /day by week 4, with dosing at 10 mg bid. Subjects will undergo 7 clinical
      visits over the 6-month trial (Screen, Baseline/Week 0, and Weeks 4, 8, 14, 20, and 24). The
      dosage can be titrated downward in increments of 5 mg to a minimum dose of 5 mg/day in the
      event memantine is not tolerated at the scheduled dosages. This broad dose range is being
      used because 1)a favorable cognitive response may be evident at lower doses of memantine
      than recommended for AD and 2)adverse effects could emerge when typical AD dosing
      recommendations are used, as has been observed when treating PD patients with cholinesterase
      inhibitors. Subjects will remain on a stable dose of memantine/placebo after Week 8, unless
      precluded by adverse events. Ten subjects will be assigned to each treatment group.
      Randomization will be stratified according to whether subjects are taking a concomitant
      cholinesterase inhibitor. This will enable secondary group comparisons of treatment groups.
      Results from this initial small study will be used to evaluate the appropriateness of
      devising a larger-scale multi-site study of memantine for treatment of dementia in PD.

      The proposed assessment schedule was designed to represent use of memantine in general
      clinical practice and to minimize the burdens to caregivers and patients, who have impaired
      mobility as well as cognitive function.
