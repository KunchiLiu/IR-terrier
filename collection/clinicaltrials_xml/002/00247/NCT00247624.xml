      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of treatment with both a sleeping pill
      and antidepressant medication in improving sleep and psychological functioning in people
      with depression and insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic insomnia is one of the most common symptoms that individuals experience during a
      major depressive episode. Insomnia may lead to increased risk for recurrence of major
      depression, as well as poor quality of life and increased risk of suicide. Studies have
      shown that treating insomnia during a major depressive episode may not only help reduce
      symptoms of major depression during the day, but also improve an individual's general
      quality of life. Thus, sleeping pills, also known as hypnotics, are commonly prescribed for
      people with psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the safety and efficacy of
      combining sleeping pills with antidepressant medications. This study will evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of treatment with both a sleeping pill and antidepressant
      medication in improving sleep and psychological functioning in people with depression and
      insomnia.

      Participants in this double-blind study will first receive fluoxetine, an antidepressant
      medication, for 1 week. Participants whose symptoms of insomnia subside after this initial
      week will continue on fluoxetine for the duration of the study and will not receive sleeping
      pills. Those who do not experience an improvement in their symptoms of insomnia after 1 week
      will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or eszopiclone, which is a sleeping
      pill, in addition to fluoxetine. All treatments will be given for 8 weeks. Participants will
      attend study visits at various points throughout the treatment phase. Follow up visits will
      occur periodically over the next 4 months. Assessments will include physiological measures
      during sleep, mood, suicidal thinking, quality of life and actigraphy, which measures the
      amount of movement during sleep.
