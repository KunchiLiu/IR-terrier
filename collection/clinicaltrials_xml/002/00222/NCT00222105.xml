  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Four monthly treatments with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, thalidomide and dexamethasone
      for newly diagnosed myeloma patients as induction therapy prior to high dose chemotherapy
      and autologous stem cell transplant.

    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable hematological malignancy of plasma cell origin. Plasma
      cell clonality and dysfunctional immunoglobulin production characterize the disease. The
      consequences of abnormal plasma cell growth are manifested by a myriad of symptoms and signs
      that often have significant impact on the patient's quality of life. These include
      pancytopenia secondary to predominant distribution of tumor cells within the bone marrow
      along with many other effects.

      This study is focused on the efficacy of Doxil® (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) with low
      dose Dexamethasone and Thalidomide (Ddt) in previously untreated patients with multiple
      myeloma.
