        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed history of retinal degenerative disease in the worse seeing eye with
             remaining vision no better than light perception. The fellow eye can have any visual
             acuity but must have better vision than the eye that will have the surgery.

          -  History of former useful form vision in worse-seeing eye

          -  Acceptable ability to describe visual percepts

          -  Age eighteen (18) or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of glaucoma

          -  Optic neuropathy or other confirmed damage to optic nerve or visual cortical damage

          -  Presence of communicable disease/infection

          -  Pregnancy

          -  History of claustrophobia

          -  Inconsistent flash detection thresholds

          -  Any other diseases that can effect the function of the retina

          -  Subjects with a Beck Depression Inventory Interpretation score of &gt;30 and subsequent
             diagnosis of depression by a psychiatrist.

          -  Corneal degeneration
