  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a worldwide pandemic of obesity with far-reaching consequences for the health of
      our nation. Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States.
      Prevention of obesity, especially in children, has been deemed by public health policy
      makers to be one of the most important objectives for our country. Obesity
      disproportionately affects citizens of minority and low socioeconomic status. A consensus of
      opinion has formed that the recently observed increased prevalence of obesity is caused by
      environmental and behavioral factors that favor easy access to high calorie foods and
      sedentary behavior. This prevention project, called LA Health, will test whether
      modification of these environmental and behavioral factors can prevent inappropriate weight
      gain in children who are enrolled in the fourth to sixth grades during Year 1. The primary
      aims of the LA Health project are to test the efficacy of two school-based approaches for
      obesity prevention. The two approaches are derived from two NIH-funded pilot studies called
      the HIPTeens project (a secondary prevention program) and the Wise Mind project (a primary
      prevention program). The study will test the efficacy of primary prevention alone and a
      combination of primary and secondary prevention in comparison to a no-treatment control
      group using a cluster randomization research design, with 18 school clusters from 9
      different parishes randomly assigned to the three treatment arms. The following parishes
      were selected for the project: East Carroll, Madison, Franklin, East Feliciana, St. John,
      St. Helena, Pointe Coupee, Avoyelles, and Sabine Parishes. Thus far East Carroll, East
      Feliciana, St. John, Pointe Coupee, and Avoyelles Parishes have agreed to participate. We
      anticipate adding additional parishes in the second year of the project.The project will
      collaborate with a USDE funded project, LA GEAR UP, to test the relative efficacy obesity
      prevention programs for children who come from economically disadvantaged environments. The
      LA GEAR UP program is designed to enhance educational achievement. Since LA GEAR UP will be
      implemented in all 18 school clusters, all of the preventions intervention arms, including
      no-treatment, will be combined with an academic enhancement program. The study will span
      three years and will provide critical tests of strategies that modify the child's
      environment as a primary prevention strategy and provide health behavior modification via
      classroom instruction and internet counseling as a secondary prevention strategy. The study
      will also recruit a similar (but smaller) sample of students to measure changes in body
      weight relative to height, gender, and age over the same three-year period. This observation
      only control group will be studied to evaluate secular trends in changes in body weight so
      that body weight changes observed in the randomized trial can be interpreted within the
      context of stable versus unstable population changes in body weight. The results of this
      investigation will significantly impact public health policy related to obesity prevention
      in rural communities, minority communities, and in children from families that are
      economically disadvantaged.
