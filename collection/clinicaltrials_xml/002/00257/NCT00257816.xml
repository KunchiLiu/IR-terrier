  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There will be approximately 14,000 new patients with invasive cervical cancer diagnosed in
      the United States in 2003 with about 4,000 deaths from this disease. This accounts for
      approximately 17% of all deaths due to gynecologic cancers. Radiation has been the primary
      treatment modality for locoregionally advanced cervical cancer. Recent trials of concomitant
      systemic cisplatin chemotherapy and radiation have shown high response rates (RR) with
      improvements in durable remissions and overall survival. Though the incidence and mortality
      in the U.S. dropped steadily from years 1940 to 2000, there has recently been a plateau,
      arresting the decline. With the routine addition of systemic Cisplatin (CDDP) chemotherapy
      to local regional radiation, mortality from advanced cervical cancer in the United States is
      expected to further decrease. However, further advances in this disease are needed.

             an effective form of contraception.

          9. Patients who are suitable for treatment with radical intent using concurrent
             cisplatin and pelvic radiation.
