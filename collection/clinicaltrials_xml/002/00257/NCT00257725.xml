      This is a single site, open-label, four-week feasibility study of long-duration beaded
      methylphenidate (B-MPH), also known as Ritalin LA™. B-MPH is a FDA-approved medication for
      children 6 years and older with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but there
      are no studies of its use in preschoolers. This study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of B-MPH for ADHD treatment in 4-to-5-year old children.

      Total study duration is approximately 5 weeks. It includes a screening evaluation and 4
      weeks of B-MPH treatment with doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg (based on the individual
      tolerability and efficacy). The study doctor will conduct parent-training sessions during
      the treatment visits.
