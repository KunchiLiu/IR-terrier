  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in three stages. In the DTP booster stage at 15 to 24 months of
      age, all subjects will receive a booster dose of Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™. In the Mencevax™
      ACWY &quot;full dose&quot; stage at 24 to 30 months of age all subjects will receive a dose of
      Mencevax™ ACWY. In the Mencevax™ ACWY &quot;small dose&quot; stage at 30 to 36 months of age, the
      first 75 subjects in each of the two centers will be tested for boostability of the MenA and
      MenC immune response by giving a fifth of a dose of a Mencevax™ ACWY vaccine. The Protocol
      Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in the group that was previously primed with Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™ will be the
      control group for the group that was previously primed with Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib-MenAC.

      Blood samples will be drawn from subjects as follows:

        -  prior to and one month after the full dose of the Mencevax™ ACWY vaccine.

        -  prior to and one month after 1/5th of a dose of Mencevax™ ACWY vaccine (only for the
           first 75 subjects in each of the two centers).
