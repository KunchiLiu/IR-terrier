      PLEASE NOTE: THIS STUDY IS ONLY ENROLLING PATIENTS CURRENTLY BEING TREATED AT BELAIR-EDISON
      FAMILY HEALTH CENTER.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of
      two cardiovascular risk reduction programs - a comprehensive intensive (Cl) intervention
      with a less intensive (LI) intervention - in African American, and white low-income patients
      with known excessive cardiovascular disease risk.

      BACKGROUND:

      The study is based on the premise that a community-based participatory research partnership
      model, using a team of an advanced practice nurse case manager, community health worker
      (CHW), and physician can be translated into urban community clinics and improve the quality
      of care and reduce disparities in cardiovascular health in minority and other underserved
      populations. Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, implementation of CVD risk-reducing
      practices remains poor. In spite of the known benefit of lowering low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) levels below 100 mg/dl in persons with existing heart disease, as many
      as 50 to 70 percent of eligible CVD patients are not placed on lipid-lowering therapy by
      their providers and from 20 to 80 percent of patients do not achieve the goals of therapy.
      The benefits of controlling high blood pressure (HBP) are well established, yet national
      rates of HBP control remain at only 31 percent despite decades of provider and patient
      education. In addition, it is well established that control of glycemia, hyperlipidemia, and
      blood pressure reduce the risk of vascular complications in people with diabetes, 75 percent
      of whom die from some form of heart or blood vessel disease. This randomized trial will
      compare the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a CI intervention with a LI
      intervention in African American, and white low-income patients with known excessive CVD
      risk.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Eligible patients with CVD or type 2 diabetes will be randomly selected from two urban
      federally funded community clinics and randomly assigned to receive either 1) a Cl
      intervention delivered by a nurse practitioner, a CHW, and the patient's physician, focusing
      on behavioral interventions to affect therapeutic lifestyle changes and medication adherence
      as well as the prescription and titration of medications or 2) a LI intervention providing
      feedback on CVD risk factors and guidelines to patients and their physicians. Outcomes will
      be measured at baseline and one and two years. It is hypothesized that a higher proportion
      of patients in the Cl intervention group will achieve the treatment goals for lipid, blood
      pressure, and diabetes management, lifestyle behaviors and utilization of antiplatelet
      agent, beta blocker, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapies and that
      the Cl intervention will be cost-effective. Secondary outcomes include assessment of the
      impact of the Cl intervention model on patients' satisfaction with care and health care
      utilization. The increase in the percentage of high-risk women and men who receive
      recommended secondary prevention therapies and achieve goal levels could potentially result
      in a marked decrement in annual CVD mortality and health disparities if applied within
      primary care settings to populations with the characteristics of the target groups for this
      study.
