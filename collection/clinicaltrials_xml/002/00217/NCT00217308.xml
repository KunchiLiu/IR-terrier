    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study is to determine the effect of probiotic lactobacilli on the vaginal
      flora and cytokine profile during pregnancy, and the incidence of preterm labour in women at
      high risk for preterm birth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm labour involves multiple causes - one of the most significant factors being a prior
      history of preterm birth. Infection is another major cause of preterm labour (PTL) and is
      estimated to cause up to 30% of PTL. Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is an alteration in the
      endogenous vaginal microflora preceded by a decreased presence of Lactobacilli species and
      increased growth of gardnerella and other pathogens. BV is a strong risk factor for PTL, and
      is associated with a 40% increased risk in some populations. Initial studies suggested that
      the treatment of BV with antibiotics could decrease the incidence of PTL, but this has not
      been confirmed by randomized trials. There is substantial evidence that the &quot;normal&quot;
      lactobacillus dominated urogenital microflora play an important role in maintenance of a
      healthy urinary and reproductive tract.

      One hundred and sixty (160) women at high risk for PTL, based on a prior history of preterm
      birth, will be approached at their first antenatal visit to participate. Recruitment of 54
      patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic BV (based on Nugent Scoring). Women with
      documented BV will be randomized to either treatment with lactobacilli preparation (n=27) or
      placebo (n=27). Women with symptomatic BV will be treated with oral Metronidazole prior to
      starting the lactobacilli or placebo. None of the subjects, researchers or clinical staff
      will know which preparation each woman receives.

      This study will be the first to examine the ability of lactobacilli preparations to maintain
      a normal vaginal flora in pregnant women. In addition, the results will potentially serve as
      the basis for a multi-centre RCT to determine efficacy of this treatment in preventing
      preterm birth.
