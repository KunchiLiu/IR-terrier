      This research aims to explore the effectiveness of memantine (Namenda) in treating
      post-menopausal women between the ages of 50 and 65, who are at risk for cognitive decline.
      Memantine has already been shown to offer cognitive benefits to patients suffering from
      Alzheimer's disease, but it's potential for treating those at risk for cognitive decline
      without Alzheimer's disease or other dementia has yet to be evaluated. It is possible that
      memantine may offer neurocognitive benefits to this population, as well. Participants are
      asked to take medication for six months, complete neuropsychological testing, and one blood
      draw.
