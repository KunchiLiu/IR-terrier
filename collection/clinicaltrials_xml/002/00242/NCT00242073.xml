  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxia (low oxygen level) is know to be present in many tumors and may strongly influence
      the success of treatment and the progression of disease in prostate cancer. The method used
      to measure tumor oxygen levels in prostate cancer is to place a needle in the prostate
      itself through the rectum. Blood oxygen level dependent imaging (BOLD MRI) is a special MRI
      technique that allows indirect assessment of oxygen levels in blood. This technique is
      non-invasive, involving no needles. BOLD has not been applied in humans in prostate cancer.
      The purpose of this study is to develop a MRI-BOLD technique that allows us to
      non-invasively measure changes related to tumor hypoxia in prostate cancer. This technique
      may provide information that will be an independent predictor of patient survival, tumor
      recurrence and likelihood of treatment response in prostate cancer
