      The purpose of this study is to compare depressive characteristics in migraine patients to
      those observed in patients with epilepsy in a previous study, and determine whether those
      symptoms are unique to patients with epilepsy.

    <textblock>
      A form of depression known as dysphoric-like disorder is common in people with epilepsy,
      which may significantly affect the quality of life in these people, as shown in a previous
      study. However, it is unclear if this depressive disorder is unique to patients with
      epilepsy. In order to assess whether these symptoms are unique and idiosyncratic to the
      epilepsy population, in this multi-center study, these dysphoric depressive features will be
      contrasted to those seen in patients with other neurologic or psychiatric conditions.
      Migraine is selected as one of the comparison disorders because it shares with epilepsy
      characteristics of being a recurrent episodic central nervous system disorder, and our site
      will only enroll patients with migraine headaches.
