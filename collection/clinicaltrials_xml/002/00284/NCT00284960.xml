      Determine if men with erectile dysfunction (ED) are more likely to have insulin resistance
      compared to healthy controls.

      Insulin is a hormone produced by the body that lets sugar into the cells, where it is used
      for energy. Insulin resistance occurs when the bodyâ€™s cells have a decreased ability to
      react to insulin. This leads to an increase in insulin secretion. Over time, insulin
      resistance can lead to higher levels of sugar in the blood (diabetes), and can also
      contribute to obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and heart disease. There
      are no simple tests to actually diagnose insulin resistance. Currently, the glucose
      tolerance test is used to diagnose IR, but it involves several blood draws over a 2-hour
      period. Another purpose of this study is to compare a blood test involving only one blood
      draw to the 2-hour glucose tolerance test, which involves several blood draws over a 2-hour
      period.

      It is well known that diabetes often leads to erectile dysfunction. Because insulin
      resistance occurs before diabetes, it is possible that erectile dysfunction may occur in
      some individuals while they have insulin resistance, but before they develop diabetes. If
      this is true, it might be possible to use erectile dysfunction as a sign of insulin
      resistance, which may lead to more timely treatment of insulin resistance and may delay or
      prevent the development of diabetes, and the other problems mentioned above.
