      -  To determine the value of using piperacillin/tazobactam in reducing the cases of ESBL
           producing E. coli or K. pneumoniae colonization and infection.

        -  To determine the acquisition rate of ESBL producing E. coli or K. pneumoniae, both pre
           and post intervention in the selected medical centers.

             control methods. Female of childbearing potential using oral contraceptives during
             study period. (Note: penicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitors may prevent oral
             contraceptives from working properly, increasing the chance of pregnancy).
