      The purpose of this study is to learn if the biomarker information obtained (learned or
      received) from the earlier studies can tell us whether or not Taxotere and/or
      Adriamycin/Cytoxan can cause tumors to become smaller.

      Large clinical trials have confirmed the value of systemic adjuvant therapy in decreasing
      the risk of recurrence and death in patients with early breast cancer. However, the need to
      identify breast cancer patients who will benefit from adjuvant therapy, while sparing others
      from the side effects of futile treatment, is spurring research into predictive markers of
      chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance. In the adjuvant setting, extremely large trials and
      long follow-up would be required to prospectively validate the predictive value of
      biomarkers of chemotherapy sensitivity or resistance. In part this is because response is
      not directly observable. Preoperative chemotherapy for large tumors (&gt;3cm) or inoperable
      breast cancer is well established and is the standard of care for locally advanced breast
      cancer. Data from large series of patients have demonstrated that preoperative (neoadjuvant)
      chemotherapy leads to significant reduction of tumor size (downstaging) and improves both
      the rate and the cosmetic results of breast- conserving surgery. The degree of response to
      neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to predict improved overall survival. This is therefore
      an attractive setting to study predictors of response because tissue is accessible from pre-
      therapeutic biopsies and tumor response is directly observable.

      In an early proof-of-principle pilot study of single agent neoadjuvant docetaxol, we
      identified a predictive gene expression pattern, and, using leave-one-cross validation, a
      method of internal validation, we demonstrated that the pattern was likely to accurately
      discriminate between responders and non-responders (Chang, J.C., et al., Gene expression
      profiling for the prediction of therapeutic response to docetaxel in patients with breast
      cancer. Lancet, 2003. 362(9381): p. 362-9). A similar pilot study of neoadjuvant AC
      undertaken by a collaborator in the UK suggests that different profiles will be predictive
      for AC response.

      In order to definitively determine predictive patterns for both regimens (T and AC) using
      improved technology for RNA preparation and a larger, more comprehensive gene expression
      array, we undertook a randomized Phase II trial of these two widely used regimens (Protocol
      H-11624 - A RANDOMIZED MULTICENTER TRIAL OF NEOADJUVANT TAXOTERE AND ADRIAMYCIN/CYTOXAN
      (AC): A BIOLOGIC CORRELATIVE STUDY). The trial is nearing completion, having recruited more
      than 90 patients out of an expected 120 patients. To date, the risks associated with this
      study have been modest, and there have been no unexpected adverse events. The laboratory
      work is well underway and gives every indication that clinically useful classifiers to
      predict treatment efficacy will result.

    <description>Chemotherapy In Arm A, patients will receive single agent Taxotere (100 mg/m2) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles before surgery. Primary surgery will then be conducted, if operable, following completion of neoadjuvant treatment. This will be followed by standard adjuvant AC (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, every 3 weeks) for 4 cycles. For patients whose BSA is greater than 2.0 m2, the Adriamycin dosage will be calculated using BSA = 2.0 m2. This is done in order to minimize Adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity.</description>
