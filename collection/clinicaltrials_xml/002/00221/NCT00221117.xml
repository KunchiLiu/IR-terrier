    <textblock>
      Functional electrical stimulation is a process that uses low intensity electrical pulses
      generated by an electric stimulator to create muscle contractions. By contracting muscles in
      a specific sequence, one can generate various body functions such as grasping, walking, and
      standing.The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness and long term benefits of
      applying functional electrical simulation during early rehabilitation to improve grasping
      function in persons who have suffered a spinal cord injury. By using functional electrical
      stimulation,these patients could potentially improve their grasping function.

      The main objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a new treatment regime
      that uses a neuroprosthesis for the improvement and recovery of grasping functions in
      persons with spinal cord injuries (SCI). This treatment has been shown to be useful for
      stroke patients with hemiplegic arm in the recovery of reaching and grasping 1, and our
      preliminary work indicates that this may also be the case with SCI patients 3. Further,
      aside from the potential of promoting voluntary grasp in SCI patients, this novel
      therapeutic approach may also impact the way service is currently delivered in SCI
      rehabilitation settings.

      A neuroprosthesis for grasping is a device that can improve or restore the grasping,
      holding, and releasing functions in persons with SCI 2, 3. The neuroprosthesis applies
      functional electrical stimulation (FES) to artificially generate a muscle contraction by
      applying short current pulses to motor nerves innervating muscles. FES can be applied to
      individuals with incomplete SCI to help them restore functions such as walking and grasping
      by contracting groups of paralyzed muscles in an orchestrated manner 4. FES was originally
      envisioned as an intervention that was 'permanent' in nature. In other words, an individual
      had to wear/use an FES orthotic device at all times if s/he wanted to generate the function
      that was impaired by SCI 4. Our application of the neuroprosthesis for grasping in this
      proposal presents a departure from this standard and established approach of FES
      application. Rather than having people be dependent on the neuroprosthesis to perform their
      activities of daily living (ADL), we plan to use the neuroprosthesis for grasping as a
      short-term intervention that will help SCI individuals recover voluntary grasping function.
      Hence, we believe that those participants who undergo our FES therapy with the
      neuroprosthesis should be able to perform grasping functions without its use once the
      treatment program is completed.

      Recent innovative advances in FES applications, spearheaded by our team, clearly indicate
      that the short-term, therapeutic intervention of the neuroprosthesis for grasping can
      enhance voluntary function in individuals with SCI 3, 5, 6. These studies also suggest that
      this novel method of applying FES to augment functional improvement has the potential to
      improve overall physical and psychological well being of persons with incomplete SCI. Since
      1999, the Co-PI of this application, Dr. Milos Popovic and Dejan Popovic's team from the
      University of Belgrade have reported anecdotal evidence that some C5 to C7 SCI individuals
      who were unable to voluntarily grasp, were later able to do so after intensive training with
      a neuroprosthesis for grasping 2, 7, 8, 9. They observed that approximately 20 to 25% of the
      individuals who trained with the FES systems were able to grasp without the assistance of
      the neuroprosthesis once the systems were removed. Although this evidence has been presented
      in several peer-reviewed publications, there have been no comprehensive studies to date that
      have investigated the long-term effects of FES treatment on recovery of the voluntary
      grasping function in persons with SCI. Consequently, this study seeks to 1) investigate
      whether a series of orchestrated FES therapies can be applied to re-train/improve voluntary
      grasping function in acute SCI individuals, and; 2) to determine whether this therapy will
      yield better results than conventional occupational therapy. Specifically, we will recruit
      participants who have C5 to C7 incomplete SCI. These individuals typically can generate weak
      wrist extension but can neither flex, extend, abduct or adduct the fingers, nor flex,
      extend, abduct or adduct the thumb. Our therapy will be used to help these individuals
      recover some or all of these functions.
