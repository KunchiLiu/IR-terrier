  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B-STN DBS is one of the most effective surgical treatments for PD patients suffering from
      levodopa-induced motor complications. The relatively low incidence of permanent adverse
      effects and the potential for neuroprotection and alteration of the natural course of PD
      suggest a highly favorable benefit-to-risk ratio of this procedure. Since neuroprotection is
      best applied early in the disease course when there are more surviving neurons, we believe
      that further investigation of this procedure is warranted. The proposed pilot study will
      provide the necessary data to substantiate the safety and tolerability of the procedure as
      well as provide data for the design of a full-scale, multicenter trial to investigate the
      hypothesis that B-STN DBS is a safe and effective treatment to slow the progression of PD.

      This pilot trial is designed specifically to collect the preliminary safety and tolerability
      data necessary to conduct a future phase III clinical trial to investigate the hypothesis
      that deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in subjects with early Parkinson's
      will slow the progression of the disease.

      The study design is a prospective, randomized, blinded, single-center trial comparing the
      safety and tolerability of B-STN DBS + ODT vs. ODT alone (control, standard of care) in 30
      subjects (15 per group) with early PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage II when off medication).

    <description>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of both the right and left sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) is an FDA approved treatment for advanced PD. DBS is not approved for early stage PD. The STN is a part of the brain that is very small in size and is located in the middle of the right and left sides of the brain. In this disease, this part of the brain becomes overactive and causes the symptoms of PD. It is thought that using DBS in this area of the brain lessens symptoms and allows patients to take less drug to control the disease. Dosage and frequency are not applicable to the DBS. Once the DBS is placed, unless deemed necessary, it will not be removed.</description>

    <description>The drugs used on this study are not investigational. They are drugs for Parkinson's disease that are standard of care. The drug form, dosage, frequency and duration will vary. Examples of drugs used include carbidopa/levodopa, pramipexole, ropinirole, and selegiline.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a clinical diagnosis of probable idiopathic PD.

          -  Demonstrated response to dopaminergic therapy, defined as demonstrating at least 30%
             improvement in parkinsonian motor signs, based upon the UPDRS motor examination
             subscore, following the administration of their DA drug(s) during the screening
             neurological examination.

          -  Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) stage II when OFF medication.

          -  No contraindications to surgery.

          -  Age between 50 and 75 years old.

          -  Available for follow-up for four years.

          -  Informed Consent: The subject understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives to
             the study procedures and participation in the study.

          -  MRI within normal range for age.

          -  Levodopa or dopamine agonist therapy for greater than six months but less than or

             past 6 months)

          -  Uncontrolled medical condition or clinically significant medical disease that would
             increase the risk of developing pre- or postoperative complications (e.g.,
