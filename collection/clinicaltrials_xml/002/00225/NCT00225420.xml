      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as
      leuprolide, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving docetaxel together with androgen ablation therapy
      and external-beam radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel when
      given together with androgen ablation therapy and external-beam radiation therapy and to see
      how well they work in treating patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel when
           administered in combination with androgen ablation therapy and adaptive external-beam
           radiotherapy in patients with high-risk localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 2-year biochemical progression-free survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of docetaxel.

        -  Androgen ablation therapy: Patients receive leuprolide acetate or other luteinizing
           hormone-releasing hormone agonist beginning 2-3 months prior to the start of
           chemoradiotherapy and continuing for up to 2 years.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and high-dose
           external-beam radiotherapy on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 7 days for 8 courses in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
