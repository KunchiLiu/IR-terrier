      The proposed study will be a 6-week open label study evaluating aripiprazole in the
      treatment of 12 male post-pubertal adolescents (13-17 years, Tanner Stage 4) diagnosed with
      conduct disorder. The initial dose depending on the weight of the patient will be as
      follows: &lt; 25 kg = 1 mg/d; 25-50 kg = 2 mg/d; 50-70 kg = 5 mg/d; &gt; 70 kg = 10 mg/d (Data on
      File, 2003, Bristol-Myers Squibb). For the first two weeks of the study, the dose will be
      flexible based on response and tolerance and thereafter will remain fixed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of atypical antipsychotics in children began in 1992 with several small case series
      with clozapine. Since that time, five other atypical agents, risperidone, olanzapine,
      quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole have been introduced into the US market. The newer
      atypical agents are not associated with agranulocytosis that has limited the usefulness of
      clozapine. Among the atypical antipsychotics, risperidone has remained the most extensively
      studied in children and adolescents, for a variety of problems, including Tourette's
      disorder, conduct disorder, schizophrenia, aggression, and pervasive development disorder.
      Risperidone has been shown to be an effective treatment in many of these disorders. However,
      weight gain, hyperprolactinemia, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are troublesome adverse
      effects more commonly associated with risperidone such that the drug's utility in this aged
      patient population is limited. We expect that the utility of aripiprazole in treating the
      pediatric population will not be limited by adverse effects like the other atypical
      antipsychotics.
