  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An autologous peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplant may be able to replace
      blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Using stem cells or bone marrow
      cells that are treated in the laboratory may be an effective treatment for acute leukemia.

      This clinical trial is studying how well an autologous stem cell transplant using specially
      treated cells works in treating patients with acute leukemia.

    <textblock>
      Patients will receive infusions of cyclophosphamide and an infusion or injection of G-CSF
      once a day for 7-14 days followed by collection of their peripheral stem cells. Some
      patients may also undergo bone marrow collection. Patients' stem cells and/or bone marrow
      will be treated in the laboratory. Patients will then receive busulfan for 4 days followed
      by cyclophosphamide for 4 days. Two days later, patients will undergo autologous peripheral
      stem cell or bone marrow transplant and then receive an infusion or injection of G-CSF once
      a day until blood counts return to normal.

      The goal of this pilot clinical study is to shorten the duration of aplasia associated with
      mafosfamide purged autologous transplants for acute leukemia using the cytokine cocktail of
      recombinant human stem cell factor (rhSCF), recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating
      factor (rhG-CSF) and recombinant human thrombopoeitin (rhTPO) for ex vivo expansion.

      After finishing treatment, patients will be evaluated periodically for at least 5 years.
