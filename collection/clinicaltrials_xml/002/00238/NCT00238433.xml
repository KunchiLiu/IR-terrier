    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Chemotherapy, such as busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa, may destroy cancerous
      blood-forming cells (stem cells) in the blood and bone marrow. Giving the patient their
      healthy stem cells will help their bone marrow make new stem cells that become red blood
      cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa work in
      treating patients who are undergoing an autologous stem cell transplant for Hodgkin's or
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the therapeutic efficacy of a myeloablative preparative regimen comprising
           busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell
           (PBSC) transplantation in patients with Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this preparative regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Myeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -8
           to -6, melphalan IV over 15-30 minutes on days -5 and -4, and thiotepa IV over 2 hours
           on days -3 and -2.

        -  Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation: Patients undergo PBSC
           transplantation on day 0 followed by filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 30 minutes beginning on
           day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Intrathecal chemotherapy: Patients with a history of treated CNS disease or at
           high-risk for CNS relapse receive methotrexate and cytarabine intrathecally (IT) for 2
           doses each within 10 days prior to transplantation and 4-6 doses each beginning on day
           32 post-transplantation.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients with residual bulk disease at 80-100 days
           post-transplantation that is &gt; 2.5 cm by CT scan may undergo local radiotherapy to
           residual scar/disease provided it can be encompassed in a single radiation port and the
           volume of lung to be irradiated is ≤ 20%.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 1 month, monthly for 6
      months, every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

5mcg/kg IVPB will be administered beginning on day +5 and continued until ANC&gt; 1500 for 2 consecutive days.
Drug: busulfan
3.2mg/kg/day for 3 days starting on day -8. Each dose of intravenous busulfan will be mixed in a concentration of 0.54 mg/ml of 0.9% saline and infused over 3 hours.
Drug: melphalan
50mg/m2/day/iv, infused over 30 minutes on days -5 and -4. The reconstituted melphalan is diluted in 250cc normal saline to a concentration not greater than 0.4 mg/ml.
Drug: thiotepa
250 mg/m2/day/iv on days -3 and -2 Procedure/Surgery: bone marrow ablation with stem cell support
The transplant therapy should begin within 2 weeks of registration, but no sooner then 30 days after the last dose of chemotherapy.
