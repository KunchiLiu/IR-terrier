  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well vorinostat works in treating patients with relapsed
      or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      vorinostat, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vorinostat may also stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of SAHA (vorinostat) as assessed by the objective
      response rate, time to progression and survival in subjects with advanced lymphoma.

      II. To assess the toxicity profile of SAHA in this patient population. III. To perform
      correlative laboratory investigations to confirm modulation of chromatin acetylation as the
      biologic target and attempt to gain insight into the downstream molecular mechanisms
      involved in the induction of apoptosis mediated by SAHA.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.

    <description>Histone acetylation by IHC will be scored as -, +, ++, or +++, reflecting both the intensity of staining as well as the number of cells stained; and histone acetylation by WB will recorded as the ratio of acetylated histone (measured by photodensitometry) divided by the total histone (H3 or H4), in order control for the amount of protein loaded. Analysis will be primarily descriptive, with the goal of describing baseline distributions and estimating the frequency and degree of changes from baseline.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed/refractory
             indolent Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Included in this category are relapsed/refractory
             follicular center lymphomas grade I, II, III, relapsed /refractory marginal zone
             B-cell lymphoma (nodal and extranodal), relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma)

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by computed tomography (CT) scan. positron
             emission tomography (PET) scan evaluations are desirable but not mandatory, so that
             patients with negative PET scans but measurable disease by CT are eligible

          -  Patients may have had up to four prior chemotherapeutic regimens; steroids alone and
             local radiation do not count as regimens (radiotherapy must have been completed at
             least 14 days prior to starting SAHA); rituxan alone does not count as a regimen,
             however, Bexxar or Zevalin do; the most recent therapy must have failed to induce a
             complete response, or there must be disease progression or recurrence after the most
             recent therapy

          -  Patients may be enrolled who relapse after autologous stem cell transplant if they
             are at least three months after transplant, and after allogeneic transplant if they
             are at least six months post transplant; to be eligible after either type of
             transplant, patients must have achieved platelet counts greater than 100,000/mcL, and
             white blood cell (WBC) greater than 1,000/mcL at some point after their transplant,
             and should have no active related infections (i.e. fungal or viral); in the case of
             allogeneic transplant relapse, there should be no active acute graft versus host
             disease (GvHD) of any grade, and no chronic graft versus host disease other than mild
             skin, oral, or ocular GvHD not requiring systemic immunosuppression

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status #2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,000/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits; patients with elevation of
             unconjugated bilirubin alone, as in Gilbert's Disease, are eligible

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(serum glutamate pyruvate [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 x
             institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine up to and including 2 mg/dl

          -  Premenopausal women must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to entry on this
             study; the effects of SAHA on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown; women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks, rituximab within three months
             (unless there is evidence of progression) or radiotherapy within 2 weeks or those who
             have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks
             earlier are excluded; this does not include use of steroids, which may continue until
             two days prior to enrollment; low dose chlorambucil should be stopped two weeks prior
             to beginning SAHA; valproic acid should be stopped at least two weeks prior to
             enrollment; nitrosoureas and mitomycin should be stopped 6 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial unless the
             metastases are controlled after therapy and have not been treated with steroids
             within the past two months

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to SAHA

             radiation therapy

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with SAHA
