      RATIONALE: Massage therapy may help relieve symptoms associated with cancer. It is not yet
      known which type of massage therapy is more effective in treating the symptoms of patients
      with cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying different types of massage therapy to
      compare how well they work in treating the symptoms of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the safety and tolerated dose (i.e., duration, techniques, and degree of
           pressure) of professional massage therapy vs professional simple presence (no touch)
           massage therapy vs usual care followed by caregiver massage therapy vs usual care in
           patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer.

        -  Correlate these therapies with pain, anxiety, depression, nausea, and shortness of
           breath in these patients.

        -  Correlate these therapies with patient quality of life and caregiver anxiety and
           depression.

        -  Determine the feasibility of teaching family caregivers how to provide massage therapy
           and the subsequent use of massage by the caregivers.

        -  Determine the effects of caregiver massage therapy on patients and caregivers.

        -  Determine the feasibility and acceptability among patients and massage therapists of a
           simple presence (no touch) massage therapy control group.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, pilot study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (professional massage therapy): Hospitalized patients are offered massage therapy
           by a licensed massage therapist for 15-45 minutes once daily for the duration of their
           hospital stay. Outpatient oncology clinic patients are offered home-based massage
           therapy by a licensed massage therapist for 15-45 minutes once daily for 3 days.

        -  Arm II (usual care): Patients receive usual care for symptom management.

        -  Arm III (professional simple presence [no touch] massage therapy): Hospitalized
           patients are offered simple presence (no touch) massage therapy comprising a room visit
           by a licensed massage therapist who places his/her hands 12 inches over the patient
           without direct touch for 15-45 minutes. Treatment is offered once daily for the
           duration of the hospital stay. Outpatient oncology clinic patients are offered
           home-based simple presence (no touch) massage therapy by a licensed massage therapist
           for 15-45 minutes once daily for 3 days.

      All patients are then randomized (a second time) to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (caregiver massage therapy): Previously hospitalized patients are offered
           home-based caregiver massage therapy for 1 month. Outpatient oncology clinic patients
           are offered home-based caregiver massage therapy for 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II (usual care): Patients receive usual care for symptom management. Hospitalized
           patients complete a questionnaire addressing symptoms, quality of life, satisfaction
           with symptom control, and time spent up or out of bed once daily on days 1-5, every 3
           days while in the hospital, and then at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month after discharge
           from the hospital. Outpatient oncology clinic patients complete a similar telephone
           questionnaire at baseline, 1 week, and then at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
