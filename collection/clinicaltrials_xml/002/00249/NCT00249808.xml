  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase IIIb/IV , open-label, multi-centre study in patients receiving efalizumab 1mg/kg/week
      for 12 weeks.

      At anytime during the first 12 weeks, non-responding or worsening patients will discontinue
      efalizumab and enter a 12-week treatment period with other approved antipsoriasis therapies.

      Objectives:

        -  To establish safe psoriasis control of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis with
           efalizumab in patients who have failed to respond to, or who have a contraindication
           to, or are intolerant of other systemic therapies including cyclosporine, methotrexate
           and PUVA.

        -  To evaluate the management of psoriasis events namely rebound and exacerbation, in
           patients while on Efalizumab or subsequent to its discontinuation
