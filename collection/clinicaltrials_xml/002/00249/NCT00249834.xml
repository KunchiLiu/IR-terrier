      CONSORT = Clinical validation of the ART treatment guidelines, which determine the optimal
      dose of r hFSH based on subject baseline characteristics/predictors of ovarian response.

      Phase IIIb/IV, open-label, multi-centre, multi-regional study. Subject will first be treated
      with a GnRH agonist according to centre's standard practice (no depot formulation will be
      allowed). Down-regulation is to be confirmed by E2 levels and/or US scan depending on
      centre's standard practice. Subject will then start r-hFSH treatment (Gonal-f® Prefilled
      Pen) at a pre-defined, fixed dose according to the provided ART treatment guidelines. Dose
      adjustment will be allowed strictly in case of risk of OHSS. Once follicular development is
      adequate (ie. at least 1 follicle ≥ 18mm and 2 follicles ≥ 16mm), a single injection of 250
      mcg of r-hCG (Ovid[t]rel [le]®) will be administered.

      Ovum Pick Up (OPU), in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) will be performed
      as per centre's standard practice.

      A post-treatment safety visit will be performed for all subjects on days 15-20 post-hCG.

    <description>The subject's Age, Body Mass Index (kg/m2), Number of follicles &lt; 11 mm on a baseline ultrasound scan, Serum FSH level in the early follicular phase of a menstrual cycle were entered in an algorithm (CONSORT calculator), which then calculated the optimal fixed starting dose of r-hFSH for each subject according to her individual characteristics.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Be an infertile subject justifying an IVF/ET treatment.

          -  Have a male partner with semen analysis within the past six months prior to study
             entry considered adequate to proceed with regular insemination or ICSI according to
             the centre's standard practice. If these criteria are not met, the subject can only
             be entered if donor sperm will be used.

          -  Be between her 18th and 35th birthday (35 not included).

          -  Have a regular spontaneous ovulatory menstrual cycle between 21 and 35 days in
             length.

          -  Have early follicular phase (Day 2-4) serum levels within the last 3 months prior to
             study entry of:

          -  FSH ≤ 12IU/L, and

          -  E2 within centre's local normal laboratory range values.

          -  Presence of both ovaries.

          -  Have a uterine cavity without abnormalities, which, in the investigator's opinion,
             could impair embryo implantation or pregnancy evolution as assessed within the last 3
             years using ultrasound (US), hysteroscopy (HSC), or hysterosalpingography (HSG).

          -  Have a negative cervical PAP test within the last 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Have at least one wash-out cycle (defined as ≥ 30 days since the last dose of
             clomiphene citrate or gonadotrophin treatment) since the last ART cycle and/or
             clomiphene citrate or gonadotrophin treatment prior to starting GnRH agonist therapy.

          -  Have a negative pregnancy test prior to beginning GnRH agonist therapy.

          -  Be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study. Have
             given written informed consent, prior to any study-related procedure not part of
             normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the
             subject at any time without prejudice to her future medical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had 2 previous ART cycles with a poor response to gonadotrophin stimulation, defined
             as ≤5 mature follicles and/or ≤3 oocytes collected in any previous IVF cycle or hyper
             response, defined as ≥25 oocytes retrieved.

          -  Any medical condition, which in the judgement of the investigator may interfere with
             the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug. In case of doubt,
             the subject in question should be discussed with Serono's Therapeutic Director.

          -  Had previous severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

          -  A body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m2 where the BMI is calculated according to the
             following formula:

          -  Any contraindication to being pregnant and/or carrying a pregnancy to term.

          -  Extra-uterine pregnancy within the last 3 months.

          -  History of 3 or more miscarriages (early or late miscarriages) due to any cause.

          -  Tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.

          -  Ovarian enlargement or cyst of unknown aetiology.

          -  Ovarian, uterine or mammary cancer.

          -  A clinically significant systemic disease.

          -  Known infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or C virus.

          -  Abnormal gynaecological bleeding of undetermined origin.

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to human gonadotrophin preparations.

          -  Any active substance abuse or history of drug, medication or alcohol abuse in the
             past 5 years.

          -  Entered previously into this study or simultaneous participation in another clinical
             trial
