      The purpose of this study is to compare the performance and compare the wear characteristics
      of two polyethylene cup liners, Marathon™ and Enduron™, in the treatment of patients with
      hip joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be
      randomly allocated to one of the polyethylene cup liners, Marathon™ or Enduron™ and will be
      evaluated at regular intervals using clinical and x-ray assessments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        i) Male or female subjects, aged between 45 and 75 years inclusive.

        ii) Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in
        this investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

        iii) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this
        investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing to return to
        the hospital for all the required post-operative follow-ups.

        iv) Subjects with non-inflammatory arthritis of the hip who require a primary hip
        arthroplasty and are considered by the Clinical Investigator to be suitable for a cemented
        femoral component and an uncemented acetabular component.

        v) Subjects who have a Charnley A classification.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        i) Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that would
        compromise their participation and follow-up in this study.

        ii) Women who are pregnant.

        iii) Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that
        could effect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

        iv) Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
        the last month.
