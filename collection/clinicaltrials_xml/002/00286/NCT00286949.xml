  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atomoxetine (Strattera) is a drug that is currently approved for treatment of attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults. Atomoxetine works to enhance
      levels of brain chemicals that may be affected in people with executive dysfunction,
      (difficulties with organization, task completion, and priority setting). Thus, atomoxetine
      has the potential to improve executive dysfunction in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).

      The goal of this study is to provide preliminary data on the effectiveness and tolerability
      of atomoxetine for the treatment of executive dysfunction in patients with PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson’s disease (PD), while defined by its motor abnormalities and associated
      dopaminergic loss, is invariably accompanied by cognitive impairment. Early in the disease
      course, the deficits are characterized by executive dysfunction with difficulties on tasks
      that involve information processing, attention, sorting, planning, set-shifting, and working
      memory and are subserved by neural connections with prefrontal brain regions. There has been
      little effort to identify treatments for these PD-related cognitive impairments, despite
      their disabling and distressing effects. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to
      conduct a small pilot study to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of atomoxetine,
      a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of executive dysfunction in
      patients with PD.

      Atomoxetine (Strattera) is currently approved by the FDA for treatment of attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults. Atomoxetine enhances dopaminergic and
      noradrenergic transmission in frontal regions that are also implicated in executive
      dysfunction and thus has the potential to improve executive dysfunction in PD as well as
      other neurological conditions. Results of the study will be used to develop a larger
      placebo-controlled trial of atomoxetine, if appropriate, as well as inform the design of
      other clinical trials on potential treatments for cognitive dysfunction in PD.

      The overall hypothesis is that atomoxetine will be an effective and safe treatment for
      executive dysfunction in PD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women with idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease, as defined by UK Brain Bank
             Criteria.

          2. Adults, ages 21 to 65 years old.

          3. Clinically significant executive dysfunction, as defined by the reported presence of
             problems with disorganization, distractibility, task completion, planning or problem
             solving that represents a decline from premorbid (pre-PD) status and is confirmed by
             the patient’s informant.

          4. Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score &gt; 26.

          5. Absence of Dementia due to Parkinson’s Disease, as defined by DSM-IV-TR.

          6. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale score &lt; 1.

          7. Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) score &lt; 4.

          8. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) Score &lt; 11.

          9. Able to provide informed consent and participate in follow-up visits during the
             8-week study duration.

         10. Availability of informant who knows the patient well and is willing to provide
             collateral information on the patient’s clinical status and response to treatment.

         11. On stable antiparkinsonian therapy for 3 months.

         12. Any stage of PD severity, e.g., Hoehn and Yahr stage I-V, but must be able to
             participate in testing battery and be capable of independent function so as to
             manifest executive dysfunction.

         13. Stable medical health with stable medication regimen for 3 months.

         14. If history of major depression or anxiety disorder, must have stable symptoms and be
             on stable therapy for 3 months.
