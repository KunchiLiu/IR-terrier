      We, the researchers, have found that growth hormone deficiency is very common in patients
      with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, which falls under the broader condition termed
      Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. Patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a typically
      are short and obese. Some of these patients are not short during childhood, but due to a
      combination of factors, they end up short as adults. We are evaluating the effect of growth
      hormone treatment in those patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a who are found to
      be growth hormone deficient. We hypothesize that growth hormone deficiency may contribute to
      the short stature and obesity found in this condition. We are also evaluating the effect of
      growth hormone on patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a who are not growth hormone
      deficient (i.e., growth hormone sufficient) in those who had been on study drug through R01
      FD003409 or who meet the criteria of idiopathic short stature or SGA.

      We are also evaluating neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning in participants with AHO
      in order to determine the specific impairments that are most common in the condition and to
      determine the best approach toward management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP1a) is a disorder that causes many endocrine and
      developmental problems. To date, medical treatment has focused primarily on maintenance of
      normal serum levels of calcium, phosphorous, and thyroid hormone. However, these therapeutic
      interventions do not address the problems of short stature, obesity, and subcutaneous
      ossifications, which for many are a source of considerable morbidity and personal distress.
      These patients require frequent medical care, blood tests, and medication adjustments. PHP1a
      is an inherited condition with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 1:15,000-
      20,000, and the studies that we propose provide an opportunity to improve the quality of
      life in affected patients. We have found that growth hormone (GH) deficiency is common in
      these patients, and our data suggest that GH testing should be part of their routine
      standard of care. We are investigating whether GH treatment can increase linear growth
      velocity and final adult height in children. We are also investigating whether GH treatment
      can reduce weight and improve a variety of metabolic disturbances and overall health in both
      children and adults.

      GH deficiency not only leads to short stature and obesity, but also to osteoporosis,
      hyperlipidemia, depressed cardiac and renal function, as well as an overall lack of energy.
      It is quite possible that treatment of GH-deficient patients with PHP1a could improve any or
      all of the above problems. GH treatment has been FDA approved for use in both children and
      adults with GH deficiency. Therefore, it may be possible to provide improvement in health
      and overall quality of life in these patients.

      Additionally, we have initiated a research study for which we are treating children with
      PHP1a who are not GH deficient (i.e., GH sufficient). The rationale is that GH treatment
      could maximize linear growth velocity prior to the premature bone fusion that occurs in this
      condition and potentially improve final adult height. The supply of growth hormone has ended
      for this study, and we are following those participants who were in this study and received
      the growth hormone supply.

      This study also seeks to define the specific neurocognitive and psychosocial disabilities in
      individuals with AHO in order to develop therapies and improve quality of life.

    <description>Growth hormone use in PHP1a.
For GH deficient PHP1a participants, the GH use is under FDA-approved indications, and the GH is considered as treatment (not study drug).
For GH sufficient PHP1a participants (all are children), the GH use is considered as study drug unless the patient meets the criteria of idiopathic short stature (in which case the GH is considered an FDA-approved treatment).</description>

For phase for growth hormone sufficient participants with PHP1a, dosage may be up to 0.37 mg per kg per week divided into daily doses subcutaneously, titrated by response and IGF-1 levels. The duration is participant dependent and also dependent on length of study and period of active recruitment.
For all GH-sufficient participants, the GH use is initiated in patients who are over 3 years of age and who are pre-pubertal provided that there are no contraindications to its use. [Enrollment for study drug has been completed and supply of study drug has ended.] As of now, the growth hormone sufficient participants must meet the criteria of idiopathic short stature or SGA indication in order to be considered for GH.</description>
