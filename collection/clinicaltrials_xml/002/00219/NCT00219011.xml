  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine if patients, who have both high blood pressure and
      heart failure and are currently receiving drug treatment for heart failure, have an
      improvement in their heart failure signs and symptoms and other indicators of heart failure
      after being treated with aliskiren on top of their current heart failure treatment.
      Aliskiren is an investigational drug; its safety will also be evaluated in this trial.
