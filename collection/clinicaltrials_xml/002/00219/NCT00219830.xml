      The purpose of this study is to investigate if a home-based walking program is an acceptable
      alternative for those who choose not to attend formal cardiac rehabilitation programs and if
      such a program has an effect on coronary risk or physical fitness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most important cause of life years lost in Northern
      Ireland (NI). A recently updated Cochrane review (Joliffe et al, 2003) confirmed the
      findings of earlier meta-analyses (O'Connor et al, 1989; Oldridge et al, 1988) which
      indicated that participation in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) reduces mortality after MI. The
      earlier work demonstrated a reduction of 20-25% in all-cause and cardiac mortality. The
      recent work allowed analysis of an increased number of patients (8440 in 32 trials) and
      reported a reduction in total cardiac mortality of up to 31%. Participation in CR after MI
      also improves well-being and reduces disability (NHS, 1998). However, informal reports
      suggest that only approximately 50% of patients actually attend a hospital based program.

      The hypothesis to be tested is that for those who chose not to attend formal CR, a
      home-based walking program is an acceptable alternative.

      This programme of work entails two separate study designs. To evaluate the home-based
      walking program, we plan a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Randomisation of subjects to
      study groups will follow determination of eligibility to participate. Participants
      randomised to the experimental group will be asked to walk for up to 30 minutes, 5-days per
      week. They will be requested to record aspects of their walking in a diary, including time,
      intensity and number of steps taken (recorded using a pedometer).

      Qualitative methodology using semi-structured interviews will be used to explore the
      experiences of those allocated to the intervention group. The attitudes and experiences of
      other non-attenders of CR who declined to participate in the trial will be explored in focus
      groups. Three focus groups each containing 8 participants are planned.

      Focus group transcripts will be analysed independently by two observers using a computer
      program (NUDIST) to identify themes and develop questions for the semi-structured
      interviews. Analysis of the semi-structured interviews will be descriptive, responses being
      categorised into themes as appropriate.

      RCT results will be analysed by intention to treat.
