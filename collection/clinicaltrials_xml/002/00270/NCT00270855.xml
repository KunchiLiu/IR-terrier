  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate and compare the health benefits of using upper
      extremity exercise versus functional electrical stimulation for lower extremity exercise. It
      is our hypothesis that both Functional Electrical Stimulation Leg Cycle Ergometry (FES LCE)
      exercise and voluntary Arm Crank Ergometry (ACE) upper extremity exercise will increase
      whole body energy expenditure, thereby increasing muscle mass, insulin sensitivity, glucose
      effectiveness and improving lipid profiles in adults with paraplegia.

      Objective: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) predispose individuals to impaired fitness, obesity,
      glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, placing them at greater risk for diabetes,
      coronary artery disease, and upper extremity overuse syndrome as body weight increases. The
      specific objectives for the current proposal are to compare the impact of FES (functional
      electrical stimulation) lower extremity exercise versus upper extremity arm crank ergometry
      on energy metabolism, body composition and fat deposition, insulin sensitivity, glucose
      effectiveness, lower extremity bone mineral density and lipid profiles, in adults with
      complete paraplegia. Research Plan: A randomized, baseline-controlled, prospective, 16-week
      interventional trial will be employed to assess the impact of FES LCE versus volitional arm
      crank ergometry exercise on energy metabolism, body composition and fat deposition, insulin
      sensitivity, glucose effectiveness, lower extremity bone mineral density and lipid profiles
      in adults with complete paraplegia. Methods: Twenty-four 18-65 y.o. individuals with motor
      complete T4-L2 SCI will be assigned to either FES lower extremity exercise or upper
      extremity arm crank ergometry to compare impact on energy expenditure, obesity, and insulin
      sensitivity. Both groups will be provided similar nutritional assessments and intervention.
      Exercise training will consist of five, 40-minute sessions at 70% maximal heart rate (HRmax)
      each week for a total of 16 weeks. Resting metabolic rate, exercise energy expenditure, body
      composition by 4-compartment modeling, visceral adiposity, insulin sensitivity, glucose
      effectiveness, lipid profiles, and lower extremity bone mineral density (BMD) will be
      determined before and after 16-week exercise interventions.
