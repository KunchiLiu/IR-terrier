  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence is the uncontrollable leakage of urine with physical effort or
      stress, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercise. Treatment for stress incontinence can be
      surgical or non-surgical. Different non-surgical treatments include pelvic muscle exercises
      and pessary use. Pelvic muscle exercises (often known as &quot;Kegel&quot; exercises) train and
      strengthen the pelvic muscles and improve incontinence. A pessary is a medical device that
      fits inside the vagina to give the urethra and bladder extra support and prevent or reduce
      urinary incontinence. Exercises and pessary use can help women with stress incontinence but
      it is not known which treatment is better, or if a combination of the two treatments at the
      same time is best. This study will determine whether pelvic muscle training and exercises,
      pessary use, or a combination of both exercises and pessary is most effective at improving
      incontinence in women. The study's primary hypothesis is that pessary use is more effective
      than pelvic muscle exercises after 3 months of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women commonly have symptoms of stress urinary incontinence (leakage with physical stress
      such as coughing or sneezing) and urinary urgency or urge incontinence (leakage associated
      with the overwhelming urge to urinate). Non-surgical treatment is usually offered as
      first-line therapy, such as pelvic muscle exercises (&quot;Kegel&quot; exercises) or pessary use. A
      pessary is a small ring that fits inside the vagina. Pelvic muscle training and exercises
      may help incontinence by increased awareness and strength of the muscles that are used in
      holding the urethra closed. Pessary use may help incontinence by providing more support to
      the bladder and urethra. Both treatments can be helpful in reducing or eliminating
      incontinence, but it is not known which treatment is better. The study will compare the
      level of improvement with pelvic muscle exercises, pessary use, and a combination of both
      exercises and pessary.

      Women with stress or mixed urinary incontinence will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups:
      (1) pelvic muscle training and exercises; (2) pessary use; and (3) both exercises and
      pessary. Women in the exercises groups will have 4 visits over 8 weeks with a specially
      trained therapist for pelvic muscle training and exercises. Women in the pessary group will
      be fitted with a pessary to be worn continuously. Assessments will include questionnaires,
      bladder diary, and physical examination. Follow-up evaluations occur at 3 months, 6 months
      (by telephone only), and 1 year after initial treatment.

      Comparisons: The level of improvement after treatment will be compared in the 3 groups. In
      addition, women in the 3 groups will record the number of accidental leakage episodes by
      bladder diary; and the frequency of those episodes will be compared in the 3 groups. Other
      aspects of health, including health-related quality of life, will be compared in the 3
      groups.
