      To characterize the effect of repeat oral dose of lapatinib treatment on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single oral and single intravenous dose of midazolam in adult cancer
      patients. Also to assess the safety and tolerability of chronic oral lapatinib therapy in
      cancer patients.

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status 0 to 2.

          -  Provided written informed consent.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function.

          -  Serum creatinine is less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance is greater than or equal to 60 ml/min based on
             Cockcroft and Gault.

          -  Total bilirubin is greater than or equal to the upper limit of normal of
             institutional values.

          -  Aspartate and alanine transaminase is less than or equal to 3 times the upper limit
             of the institutional values.

          -  Have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 40% based
             on electrocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA).

          -  Resting oxygen saturations of greater than 90%.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Have malabsorption syndrome, a disease affecting gastrointestinal function.

          -  Resection of the stomach or small bowel.

          -  Evidence of symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Is considered medically unfit for the study by the investigator as a result of the
             medical interview, physical exam, or screening investigations.

          -  Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to the investigational product.

          -  Use of anilinoquinazolines, such as gefitinib [Iressa™], erlotinib [Tarceva™].

          -  Immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction to midazolam or any component of the
             formulation, including benzyl alcohol (cross-sensitivity with other benzodiazepines
             may exist).

          -  Has narrow-angle glaucoma which is a contraindication to midazolam use.

          -  Has received treatment with any investigational drug in the previous 4 weeks.

          -  Received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy or hormonal therapy within the
             past 14 days, with the exception of mitomycin C within the past 6 weeks.

          -  Currently receiving amiodarone or has received amiodarone in the 6 months prior to
             screening.

          -  Is taking regular doses of opiates that in the opinion of the investigator would put
             the patient at risk of clinically significant respiratory compromise when midazolam
             is administered.

          -  Physiological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol.

             functional classification system.

          -  Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality.

          -  Clinically assessed to have inadequate venous access for protocol-related blood
             draws.
