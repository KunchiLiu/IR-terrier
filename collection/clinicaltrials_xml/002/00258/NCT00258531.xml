  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  A commercial 3-dimentional magnetic imaging system (Olympus ScopeGuide) is available
           for routine use during colonoscopy.

        -  No randomised trials have been performed to evaluate if, and to what extent, the use of
           this technology may improve the coecal intubation rate and reduce the patient's
           experience of discomfort and pain by making the insertion of the endoscope easier

      Endoscopist at different level of experience are to participate. Patients routinely referred
      to the outpatients department for colonoscopy are asked to participate in a randomised trial
      where coecal intubation rate and pain experienced by the patient are end-point. Written
      informed consent is obtained. For each endoscopist, allocated patients are randomised to
      colonoscopy with no imaging technique (usual care) or using the 3-dimentional imager.
