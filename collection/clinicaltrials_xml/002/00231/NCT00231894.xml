  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study with an approved drug for treating type 2 diabetes, for its effects on
      treating glucose and lipid abnormalities in patients being treated with olanzapine and
      clozapine, and comparison of effects of this drug with another treatment lifestyle
      modification. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be treated with pioglitazone for 12
      weeks. They will be evaluated for fasting glucose and lipids, glucose-tolerance tests, and
      neurocognitive battery and tests of verbal memory at baseline and during treatment with
      pioglitazone.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of pioglitazone added to
      weight-lifestyle intervention vs. placebo plus lifestyle intervention on reversing or
      reducing impaired or abnormal triglycerides, HDL and glucose metabolism in schizophrenics
      treated with clozapine or olanzapine. Another aim is to examine the effects of impaired
      glucose metabolism on verbal memory and other cognitive function in schizophrenic patients
      treated with these medications and the relationship to improvements in impaired glucose
      metabolism to impairments in cognitive function. Clozapine and olanzapine, two second
      generation antipsychotics effective for treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, have
      been reported to be associated with increased incidence of diabetic type metabolic
      abnormalities, decreases in insulin sensitivity, and abnormal glucose tolerance tests. This
      can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes and also abnormal lipid metabolic levels
      which can lead to atherosclerotic changes and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and
      other diabetes related complications. Drug treatments which could reduce or correct these
      diabetic metabolic changes would permit many patients to continue to receive the benefits of
      these antipsychotic medications with reduced drug-induced comorbidity. Previous research
      using non-psychotic subjects has shown that diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are
      associated with cognitive impairments, especially in verbal memory, and provides a rationale
      for testing whether corrections of impaired glucose metabolism are associated with cognitive
      improvements in schizophrenic patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients will be males or females, 18-70 yrs of age, with a diagnosis of
             schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and currently being treated with
             olanzapine or clozapine.

          2. Patients will have evidence of:

               1. glucose levels indicating at least impaired fasting glucose: fasting glucose 100
                  mg/dL or 2 hr glucose tolerance test 140 mg/dL, or current treatment with oral
                  antidiabetic drugs with history of hyperglycemia;

               2. Triglyceride levels &gt; 150 mg/dL and/or HDL levels &lt; 40 mg/dL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetes mellitus, type 1

          2. Recent diabetic ketoacidosis;

          3. Patients not currently treated with oral antidiabetic drugs but fasting is glucose
             140 mg/dL [WHO criteria] on repeat testing in last three months, or random blood
             glucose &gt;200 mg/dL plus 2 hr glucose on GTT &gt;200 mg/dL; (these patients may need more
             immediate treatment with antidiabetic drugs and it is less certain if
             weight-lifestyle treatment would be effective in treating such high glucose levels);

          4. Patients with active liver disease with clinical abnormalities which need current
             treatment, or liver enzymes (Alt) 3 times upper limit for normal values in chart
             records in last year, or patients who are recorded as positive for hepatitis C;

          5. Congestive heart failure (Class III or IV cardiac status) or history of MI in medical
             record (because pioglitazone can increase blood volume slightly);

          6. Hematocrit greater than 10% below normal (hematocrit may be decreased 2 to 4% due to
             increased plasma volume);

          7. Female patients on current oral contraceptives (because pioglitazone may interfere
             with effects of some oral contraceptives);

          8. Patients taking ketoconazole,

          9. Patients who have started on atorvastatin or gemfibrozil in the past 2 months or have
             had a dose increase in atorvastatin in the last month (since these drugs can also
             lower triglycerides and raise HDL, recent start of therapy with these drugs could be
             a confound).

         10. Patients are not concomitantly treated with aripiprazole or ziprasidone.
