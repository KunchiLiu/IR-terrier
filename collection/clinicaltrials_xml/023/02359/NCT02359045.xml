    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, cross-over study in healthy subjects performed at a
      single study center. The study is divided into two parts, Part 1 and Part 2. The purpose of
      the study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of three different prototype capsule
      formulations (omega-3-carboxylic acids test formulations) with Epanova® capsules 1000 mg
      under fasted conditions in Part 1 and under fed conditions in Part 2. The results will be
      used as basis for choice of formulation for further pharmaceutical development.
