    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab and to see how
      well it works in treating younger patients with high-grade gliomas (brain tumors that are
      generally expected to be fast growing and aggressive), diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas
      (brain stem tumors), or brain tumors with a high number of genetic mutations that have come
      back, progressed, or have not responded to previous treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such
      as pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety and describe adverse effects associated with administration of
      the adult recommended dose of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in children with recurrent,
      progressive or refractory non-brainstem high grade glioma (NB-HGG) and diffuse intrinsic
      pontine glioma (DIPG).

      II. To estimate the sustained objective response rate, (complete response [CR] + partial
      response [PR], sustained for at least 9 weeks) associated with pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      treatment for pediatric patients with recurrent, progressive or refractory NB-HGG or DIPG.

      III. To establish the safety and describe adverse effects associated with administration of
      the adult recommended dose of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in pediatric patients with progressive
      or recurrent hypermutated tumors, including those with conditional mismatch-repair
      deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome.

      IV. To estimate the sustained response rate of pediatric patients with progressive or
      recurrent hypermutated NB-HGG, including those with CMMRD syndrome, treated with MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab).

      V. To determine changes in the immunophenotypic profile of PD-1hi CD8+ T cells from serial
      peripheral blood samples obtained before and during treatment with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)
      in pediatric patients with hypermutated brain tumors, including those with CMMRD syndrome.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the relationship between outcome (response and progression-free survival [PFS])
      and potential biomarkers, including programmed cell death (PD)-ligand 1 (L1) expression,
      patient immunophenotype, ribonucleic acid (RNA) signature profile, and tumor gene expression
      profile.

      II. To estimate the duration of objective response, progression-free/event-free survival and
      document overall survival for patients with NB-HGG and DIPG treated with MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab).

      III. To evaluate PD-L1 expression on archival tissue obtained from patients with
      non-brainstem high-grade glioma.

      IV. To examine the ability of quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and
      diffusion/weighted imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping to provide early
      assessment of tumor behavior and specifically distinguish pseudoprogression/tumor
      inflammation from tumor progression.

      V. To explore the use of serial MR permeability (dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE]) and MR
      perfusion (dynamic susceptibility contrast [DSC]) to determine if elevated relative cerebral
      blood volume (rCBV) and transfer coefficient (ktrans) can distinguish
      pseudoprogression/tumor inflammation from tumor progression in tumors treated on this
      protocol.

      VI. To characterize biomarkers, patient immunophenotyping, mutational load (as determined by
      whole exome sequencing) and the tumor gene expression profile in patients with HGG receiving
      MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      VII. To estimate the duration of objective response, PFS/event free survival and document
      overall survival of pediatric patients with progressive or recurrent hypermutated NB-HGG,
      including those with CMMRD syndrome, treated with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      VIII. To estimate the PFS and sustained objective response rate of pediatric patients with
      hypermutated progressive low grade gliomas including those with CMMRD, treated with MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab).

      IX. To categorize the T-cell receptor repertoire in PD-1+ cells obtained from peripheral
      blood or from tumor tissue, when available, before and after treatment with MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab) in pediatric patients treated in stratum C (hypermutated brain tumors).

      X. To define the specificity of T-cell receptors against tumor antigens identified in
      objective IX.

      XI. To characterize functional features of T-cell populations after MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)
      treatment and relate these findings to epigenetic programs within these cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 34 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
