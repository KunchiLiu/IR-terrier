    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ramucirumab in
      Japanese participants with advanced stomach cancer who have not received chemotherapy.
      Participants will take ramucirumab in combination with other anti-cancer drugs.

             adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting are eligible.

          -  Measurable or nonmeasurable, but evaluable, disease, determined using guidelines in
             Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.

          -  Uncontrolled arterial hypertension, despite standard medical management.

          -  A serious or nonhealing wound or peptic ulcer or bone fracture at enrollment.

          -  Undergone major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment, or subcutaneous venous
             access device (reservoir) placement within 7 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Radiation therapy within 14 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Received any previous systemic therapy (including investigational agents) targeting
             VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) or the VEGF receptor signaling pathways.
