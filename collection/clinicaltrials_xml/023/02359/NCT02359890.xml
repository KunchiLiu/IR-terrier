        Inclusion Criteria:

             electrocardiographically documented within one (1) year prior to enrollment and a
             physician's note indicating recurrent, self-terminating AF. Electrocardiographic
             documentation may include, but is not limited to, electrocardiogram (ECG),

             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or any other disease or malfunction of the
             lungs or respiratory system that produces chronic symptoms

          -  Significant congenital anomaly or medical problem that in the opinion of the
             investigator would preclude enrollment in this study

          -  Women who are pregnant (as evidenced by pregnancy test if pre-menopausal)

          -  Enrollment in an investigational study evaluating another device, biologic, or drug
