  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pervasiveness of high-calorie, nutrient-poor snacks in the environment is believed to
      have contributed to the epidemic levels of obesity and cardiometabolic disease in the U.S.
      This project tests whether a novel snack vending machine system that uses brief time delays
      to reduce the immediacy of reward from unhealthy snacks will improve the healthfulness of
      snack choices. If successful, this project will identify a new environmental intervention
      that could contribute substantially to obesity and cardiometabolic disease prevention
      efforts in schools, worksites, and other settings.

      Environmental interventions that address the high availability of unhealthy snacks in the
      environment are needed to prevent a large projected increase in the incidence of obesity and
      cardiometabolic disease in the U.S. Prior studies from the investigators group and others
      suggests that the human preference for immediate gratification from food drives dietary
      overconsumption, but this knowledge has not yet translated to more effective dietary
      intervention strategies. This project tests whether a novel snack vending machine system
      that uses brief time delays to reduce the immediacy of reward from unhealthy snacks will
      improve the healthfulness of snack choices. The project includes two studies. First, a
      laboratory study will be conducted to identify the optimum time delays to apply to unhealthy
      snacks. One-hundred sixty-eight individuals will purchase snacks classified as healthy or
      unhealthy at varying delay intervals. Specific Aim 1 is to select the delay interval that
      produces the largest improvement in purchasing rates for healthy snacks without harming
      overall vending sales, a key aspect of intervention feasibility in the real world. The
      second study uses an experimental design to compare brief time delays, two forms of 25%
      differential pricing, and time delays combined with both forms of 25% differential pricing
      on their ability to increase purchasing of healthy snacks. Two test machines will be placed
      in existing, high-volume vending locations, and each of these five experimental conditions
      will run for four weeks. Additionally, baseline purchasing under no intervention will be
      monitored for four weeks before and four weeks after the five experimental conditions.
      Specific Aim 2a compares the effects of these five interventions on the proportion of total
      vending sales from healthy snacks. Specific Aim 2b evaluates whether these intervention
      effects translate into clinically meaningful improvements in calorie and nutrient
      purchasing. Specific Aim 3a tests whether time delays or differential pricing harm overall
      vending machine sales in the test machines, and Specific Aim 3b evaluates whether snack
      machine sales are &quot;displaced&quot; to nearby vending machines during any of the experimental
      conditions. This study not only tests a compelling theory about the effects of time delays
      and immediate reward on food choice, but evaluates the efficacy and feasibility of a novel
      intervention to improve the healthfulness of snack choices in worksites, schools, and other
      settings.
