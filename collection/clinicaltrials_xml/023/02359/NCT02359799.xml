    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of home-based and lab-based
      stretching and active movement rehabilitation in reducing joint impairments in cerebral
      palsy using a portable rehabilitation robot. Children with spastic cerebral palsy and ankle
      impairments are divided randomly into two groups, participating in robot-guided passive and
      active movement training in a research lab setting (lab group) or in home setting (home
      group).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants are randomly assigned to the lab group or home group.

      For the lab-based training (lab group), the participation will involve 18 training sessions
      over six weeks with 3 sessions/week. In addition, there are 3 visits for outcome evaluations
      carried out before and after the six-week training, and at six weeks after the multi-week
      training as follow-up.

      For the home-based training (home group), the training will last for six weeks and will take
      place at least three times a week at home, after the participants have been instructed and
      trained on how to use the portable rehabilitation robot properly. Participants will come to
      the research lab for outcome evaluations before, after the six week training, and at follow
      up.

      For the home group, the participants will be initially trained by the research team at the
      lab setting on how to use the rehabilitation robot. The training will be done over the first
      one or two sessions. The research team will go through with the participants and family
      members on how to operate the rehabilitation robot at home. The participants and their
      family members practice using the rehabilitation robot at the lab setting until they feel
      comfortable using the robot independently. Before taking the device home, the participants
      are asked to go through each step of the training without assistance from the research
      staff. After the training, the participants and family member will take the portable
      rehabilitation robot home using their own vehicles and conduct the training at home.
      Audiovisual interaction and instruction can be done through Internet if the participants
      need help in conducting the training. Training data and results saved in the rehabilitation
      robot, which can be uploaded to the server managed by the research team. Training parameters
      can be adjusted based on the progress.

      For both groups, in each of the 18 training sessions, the participant is seated with the
      foot attached to a footplate and leg fixed by a leg-support. The ankle joint will be rotated
      slowly to the joint extreme upward and downward to stretch the joint. The participant is
      also asked to move the joint voluntarily to play videogames on a computer. Each treatment
      session lasts approximately one hour.

      Outcome Evaluations

      Evaluations are done before, after the training treatment sessions, and at the follow-up.
      During the evaluation sessions, the ankle will be moved by the robot to evaluate the passive
      properties including passive range of motion and joint stiffness. The participants will also
      move the ankle voluntarily and their active control ability including active range of motion
      and muscle strength will be evaluated. Clinical examination is done to evaluate clinical
      scales including modified Ashworth scale, selective control Assessment of lower extremity
      (SCALE), balance, and walking ability (distance covered in 6 minutes).
