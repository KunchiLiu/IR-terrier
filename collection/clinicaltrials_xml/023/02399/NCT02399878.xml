  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory complications represent the second most frequent type of postoperative
      complications with an incidence estimated to range from 2.0% to 7.9%

      It has been shown that intra-operative protective ventilation is associated with a reduced
      risk of respiratory complications. The effects of intra-operative inspiratory oxygen
      fraction (FiO2) remain to be investigated.

      In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the association between intra-operative
      FiO2 and respiratory complication as well as surgical site infection and ICU admission in
      patients undergoing non-cardiothoracic surgery. The investigators primary hypothesis is that
      high intra-operative FiO2 increases the risk of postoperative respiratory complications
      independent of predefined risk factors.
