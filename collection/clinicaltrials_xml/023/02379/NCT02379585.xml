  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to see how safe the use of short-term fasting is in breast cancer patients who
      will receive chemotherapy before undergoing surgery and to examine if the use of short-term
      fasting will decrease the side effects of chemotherapy and how much a tumor shrinks while
      receiving chemotherapy.

      All the eligible patients will fast 24 hours before and 24 hours after the administration of
      chemotherapy which will consist of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide every 2 weeks for four
      cycles followed by paclitaxel every 2 weeks for four cycles (dose-dense AC + T) For patients
      with HER2 negative breast cancer, or for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer:
      docetaxel (T) every 3 weeks for four cycles. Trastuzumab (H) and Pertuzumab (P) will be
      given concurrently with docetaxel for a total of 4 cycles before surgery. For patients who
      do not achieve pathological complete remission (pCR), adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin
      (A) plus cyclophosphamide (C) every 3 weeks for four cycles will be given, followed by
      trastuzumab every 3 weeks to complete 1 year of treatment. For patients with pCR, only
      trastuzumab every 3 weeks will be given adjuvantly to complete 1 year of treatment (TPH +
      AC).

    <description>Patients will receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every two weeks for four cycles (one cycle is defined as 14 days).

    <description>will receive docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab every three weeks for four cycles (one cycle is defined as 21 days). An injection of pegfilgrastim will be administered after chemotherapy with docetaxel. The appropriate surgery will be done three to six weeks after completing the last cycle of docatexel. If the study doctor determines that additional chemotherapy is needed (based on tumor shrinkage), patients will receive both doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every three weeks for four cycles and after the fourth cycle you will receive trastuzumab every three weeks for one year or patients will receive trastuzumab alone every three weeks for up to one year</description>
