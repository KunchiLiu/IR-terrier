      recurrent or metastatic HER-2 negative breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related death
      in American women. Despite recent improvement in the treatment of breast cancer, 40,000
      women still die each year in the US as a result of breast cancer. Chemotherapy (usually
      consisting of sequential single agent) remains the backbone of treatment for patients with
      HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer. A majority of patients show an initial response to
      treatment, but all eventually show disease progression.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of BYL719 combined with
      Nab-Paclitaxel that results in no serious side effects. The safety and effectiveness of
      BYL719 combined with Nab-Paclitaxel to treat patients with HER-2 negative breast cancer will
      be assessed, along with the determination of how long this drug combination will keep the
      disease from getting worse.

      The study will be done in two parts:

      Part 1 will determine the highest dose of BYL719 that is safe and tolerable to take in
      combination with Nab-Paclitaxel. Part 1 will be completed before Part 2 begins.

      Part 2 will investigate taking BYL719 (at the dose determined in Part 1) + Nab-Paclitaxel is
      safe and effective for patients with HER-2 negative breast cancer.
