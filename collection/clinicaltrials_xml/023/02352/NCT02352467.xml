  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of complete wound healing in a
      prospective, open-label, randomized trial in which pressure ulcers will be treated using
      Aurix and standard care and compared 1:1 to patients receiving undefined Usual and Customary
      Care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a common problem in all patient care settings, especially
      long-term acute care facilities and nursing homes. Aurix is a platelet-rich plasma gel used
      in the treatment of non-healing chronic wounds. The results of Aurix to date when used to
      treat PUs have been promising. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of
      complete wound healing in a prospective, open-label, randomized trial in which pressure
      ulcers will be treated using Aurix and standard of care to determine time to heal at 16
      weeks. Comparison will be made to patients receiving undefined Usual and Customary Care in a
      1:1 manner.

    <description>Compare complete wound healing at 16 weeks for all pressure ulcers treated with Aurix plus standard of care with patients randomized to usual and customary care. Complete wound closure is defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage or dressing requirements confirmed at two consecutive study visits 2 weeks apart (FDA Guidance for Industry Chronic Cutaneous Ulcer and Burn Wounds ─ Developing Products for Treatment, 2006).</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Medicare eligible

          2. ≥18 years of age

          3. Ulcer of pressure/shear etiology (Stage II, III, and IV, see Appendix 9 for stage
             definitions)

          4. The largest non-healing wound, if multiple wounds are present, or the single wound to
             be treated (Index Ulcer) that is located on the heel, ischium, sacrum, and trochanter

          5. For subjects with potentially multiple eligible PUs, the largest ulcer will be
             selected as the Index Ulcer for study. There must be at least 4 cm between the Index
             Ulcer and other ulcers; if all ulcers are closer than 4 cm, the subject should not be
             enrolled (screen failure)

          6. Debrided ulcer size between 3 cm2 and 200 cm2

          7. Subject has received UCC care for ≥ 2 weeks at treating wound clinic

          8. Demonstrated adequate pressure relief regimen

          9. Duration ≥ 1 month at first visit

         10. Subject must be willing to comply with the Protocol, which will be assessed by
             enrolling clinician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects known to be sensitive to Aurix components (calcium chloride, thrombin,
             ascorbic acid) and/or materials of bovine origin

          2. Stage I pressure ulcers

          3. Ulcers that are unstageable or of deep tissue morphology that have yet to become an
             open wound

          4. Presence of another wound that is concurrently treated and might interfere with
             treatment of index wound by Aurix

          5. Ulcer not of PU pathophysiology (e.g., pure diabetic, vasculitic, radiation,
             rheumatoid, collagen vascular disease, venous, or arterial etiology)

          6. Patients on chemotherapeutic agents or any malignancy in the wound area

          7. Subjects who are cognitively impaired

          8. Serum albumin of less than 2.5 g/dL

          9. Plasma Platelet count of less than 100 x 109/L

         10. Hemoglobin of less than 10.5 g/dL

         11. Subject has inadequate venous access for repeated blood draw required for Aurix
             Administration.

         12. Life expectancy of &lt; 6 months.
