      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies omega-3 fatty acid in reducing cancer-related
      fatigue in breast cancer survivors. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acid may help reduce
      cancer-related fatigue in breast cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect preliminary statistical data (mean changes and standard deviations) on two
      omega-3 supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) regimens (1.65 g/day and 3.3 g/day) compared to
      placebo for reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in fatigued breast cancer survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the adherence and adverse events for the two omega-3 supplementation
      regimens (1.65 g/day and 3.3 g/day) compared to placebo.

      II. To collect preliminary statistical data (mean changes and standard deviations) on two
      omega-3 supplementation regimens (1.65 g/day and 3.3 g/day) compared to placebo for reducing
      inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor
      [TNF]-alpha) in fatigued breast cancer survivors.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the effects of the two omega-3 supplement regimens on serum fatty acid levels
      compared to placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive low-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) and placebo PO BID for 6 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive high-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation PO BID for 6 weeks.

      ARM III: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 6 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models will be used with baseline as the covariate and follow-up as the response to assess the mean changes and standard deviations between the groups. Separate ANCOVA models will be used for the BFI-SF and MFI-SF. The Spearman Rank correlation will be calculated between the change in serum omega-3 fatty acid levels and changes in BFI-SF and MFI-SF to examine the dose-response effect.</description>

    <measure>Adherence for the two omega-3 fatty acid supplementation regimens compared to placebo, measured by the Morisky Medication Adherence Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A chi-square will be used to test the difference in adherence between each omega-3 fatty acid arm versus placebo. The Morisky Medication Adherence Questionnaire will be administered and used to categorize participants into three groups: high, moderate, and low adherence. Adherence differences between actual and believed group assignment will be examined.</description>

    <description>ANCOVA models will be used with baseline as the covariate and follow-up as the response to assess the mean changes and standard deviations from baseline to follow-up between the groups.

    <description>The differences between the three arms will be evaluated in time trajectory of the serum fatty acid levels with a linear mixed-effects model. The three time points (weeks 0, 3, and 6) will be the response. Comparisons of least squares means between arms will be performed using the Tukey multiple comparisons procedure.</description>
