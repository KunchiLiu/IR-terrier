        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is at least 18 years old

          2. Subject is able and willing to comply with the follow-up schedule and protocol

          3. Peripheral neuropathy for at least 6 months

          4. Failed conservative treatments for chronic pain including but not limited to
             pharmacological therapy, physical therapy and interventional pain procedures for
             chronic pain

          5. Average baseline pain rating of 60 mm on the Visual Analog Scale in the primary
             region of pain

          6. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is psychologically appropriate for
             the implantation for an active implantable medical device

          7. Subject is able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subject of childbearing potential is pregnant/nursing, plans to become
             pregnant or is unwilling to use approved birth control

          2. Escalating or changing pain condition within the past month as evidenced by
             investigator examination

          3. Subject has had corticosteroid therapy at an intended site of stimulation within the
             past 30 days

          4. Subject has had radiofrequency treatment of an intended target dorsal root ganglion
             within the past 3 months

          5. Subject currently has an active implantable device including implanted cardioverter
             defibrillator, pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator or intrathecal drug pump

          6. Subject is unable to operate the device

          7. Subjects currently has an active infection

          8. Subject has, in the opinion of the Investigator, a medical comorbidity that
             contraindicates placement of an active medical device

          9. Subject has participated in another clinical investigation within 30 days that may
             confound the outcomes of the current study as determined by the investigator
