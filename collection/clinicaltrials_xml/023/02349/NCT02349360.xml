  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effects of the probiotic,
      Lactobacillus johnsonii N6.2, on safety, gastrointestinal function, wellness, fecal bacteria
      and blood biomarkers in healthy individuals.

      Healthy adult volunteers (30 individuals) from 18-50 years of age will be recruited through
      the University of Florida and randomly distributed into two groups. This study is divided
      into 3 phases: baseline, intervention (study treatment) and washout. Participants will
      receive either the probiotic or placebo during the intervention phases. During the baseline
      phase, blood and fecal samples will be collected about 1 week before intervention
      initiation. On the day of a scheduled blood draw, the participant will need to arrive fasted
      overnight, and a light breakfast will be provided after blood draw. Starting on day 1 of the
      intervention phase, a second baseline blood sample will be collected and the participant
      will begin the study intervention (probiotic or placebo). Participants will consume 1
      capsule (probiotic or placebo) daily for 8 weeks, and blood and stool samples will be
      collected and processed (on or around weeks 2, 4 and 8 of the intervention phase). A Fisher
      Scientific commode specimen collection system will be provided for stool collections. The
      stool collection kit may be taken home (participants will be asked to drop off the stool
      within 4 hours of defecation) for fecal sample collection or may use the restroom in the
      clinical lab at the Food Science and Human Nutrition Building in which kits will be provided
      for use. In the wash-out phase, participants will not consume the capsule (either the
      probiotic or placebo), but will provide blood and stool samples (on or around week 12).
      Throughout the study, participants will provide a total of 5 stool samples and 6 blood
      samples. Participants will be asked to complete daily and weekly questionnaires throughout
      all phases of the study, which will ask about quality of life (physical functioning, mental
      functioning, level of sleep, etc.), gastrointestinal function, and dietary intake. These
      assessments will be self-reported via online questionnaires. In the event that internet
      access is not available for a portion of the study, paper copies of the questionnaires may
      be provided.
