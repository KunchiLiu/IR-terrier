    <time_frame>2 years max</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) will be calculated from the date of the first dose of treatment to the date of progression or death (whichever comes first), or last date with no progression</description>

    <measure>The Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
