      Background:

      - Brain activity changes with changes in body temperature. Brain activity can be studied
      with a procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Researchers want to cool
      the brain through the scalp using a cooling cap. They want to see if cooling changes the
      brain and body s response to TMS.

      Objectives:

      - To look at the effects of cooling on the brain.

      Eligibility:

      - Right-handed adults age 18 50 who can abstain from caffeine and tobacco.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will be
           asked about alcohol use, smoking, and substance abuse. They may take a pregnancy test.
           They may have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. For MRI,
           participants lie on a table that slides in and out of a metal tube that takes pictures.

        -  Participants will have 3 outpatient visits. The following procedures will occur at each
           visit.

        -  Participants will wear a cooling cap for up to 45 minutes. Cool water will flow through
           the cap. It will feel like an ice pack in a towel. Their core temperature will be
           monitored. Their temperature will also be measured under their tongue and on scalp,
           stomach, forearm, and calf.

        -  Participants will have TMS before and after wearing the cap. A brief electrical current
           will pass through a wire coil held on their scalp. Electrodes that detect muscle
           movement will be placed on their hand. They will also have repetitive TMS, which uses
           repeated magnetic pulses. Their wrist will also receive a shock.

      1. Objective

           The dysregulation of synaptic transmission in certain brain areas may be responsible
           for some neurological disorders. It was demonstrated that synaptic transmission may be
           modulated through repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and this may be
           a component of the therapeutic effects of rTMS. However, rTMS utility is limited due to
           an inability to focus the stimulation. Cooling was shown to reduce the neuronal
           activity in targeted brain areas. The goal of this protocol is to examine the ability
           of cooling to affect rTMS.

        2. Study population

           We intend to study 18 adult healthy volunteers on an outpatient basis. The accrual
           ceiling requested is 23 subjects to allow for dropouts and screening failures.

        3. Design

           We propose using rapid-rate paired associative stimulation (rPAS), modulated by
           applying cooling to the scalp, to examine the effect of cooling on rTMS. Our hypothesis
           is that cooling the brain will prevent the potentiation normally induced by rPAS. We
           will reduce brain temperature by up to 1.5o C by applying a cooling helmet to the scalp
           and then test the effect on potentiation by applying rPAS.

             -  This study consists of one experiment with18 subjects. The experiment is divided
                into three sessions, each to be carried out at least 1 day apart.

             -  The control potentiation in response to rPAS without cooling will be measured
                during session 1 by using the TMS-evoked motor evoked potential (MEP). In session
                2, after applying a commercially available liquid cooling helmet for 45 minutes to
                reduce the temperature of the underlying cerebral cortex by up to 1.5oC, we will
                then assess the response to rPAS. In session 3, the MEP will be measured after
                applying the cooling helmet but with the rPAS procedure substituted with a sham
                rPAS. Session 3 is necessary to determine if there are any changes to the MEP in
                response to cooling alone. Thus, in the three sessions, we will evaluate cooling
                alone, rPAS alone, and the two together.

        4. Outcome measures

      The primary outcome measure will be the amplitude of MEPs induced by single TMS pulses
