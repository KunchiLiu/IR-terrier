    <textblock>
      This study examines the effects of individualized diet and exercise plans on muscle
      strength, quality of life and respiratory function in Pompe disease. Subjects will be given
      a diet and exercise plan based on their individual needs, which will be followed for 16
      weeks. Participants will also be provided with an activity tracker, such as a FitBit or
      Apple Watch, in order to track their diet and exercise activities, and will also come to the
      University of Florida for exercise tests, respiratory tests and questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pompe is a rare disease, which occurs in approximately 1 in 40,000 births. It is a
      progressive and often fatal neuromuscular disorder resulting from a mutation in the gene for
      acid alpha- glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme necessary for the degradation of glycogen. Common
      symptoms include skeletal and smooth muscle myopathy, resulting in respiratory
      insufficiency, peripheral muscle weakness and generalized fatigue.

      The progressive myopathy in Pompe disease seems to be influenced by increased muscle protein
      breakdown. The increased muscle protein breakdown leads to muscle wasting, weakness,
      increased resting energy expenditure and, consequently, increased fatigue. Our hypothesis is
      that a high protein, low carbohydrate diet associated with regular physical exercise will
      improve respiratory and peripheral muscle functions in Pompe disease. In this study, we will
      investigate the effects of 16 weeks of planned diet and exercise in adolescent and young
      adult (15-60 years old) individuals with Pompe disease using an activity tracker.

    <description>Patients will be given an individualized diet and exercise plan by a physical therapist and registered dietician. The diet and exercise plan will be carried out by the participant for 16 weeks. The aerobic and strength training will be performed under the supervision of a personal trainer or certified exercise physiologist that is local to the participant, and the core-stabilizing exercises can be performed at home or in an approved group class. The participant will wear an activity tracker at all times during this 16 week period, and will be asked to manually enter data into a phone application, such as diet information and weight.
The subject will be asked to come to the University of Florida 4 times throughout the study (Screening, Baseline, Month 4 and Month 7 Follow Up) for exercise testing, quality of life questionnaires, respiratory function testing and blood draws.</description>

Diet will be constructed so that 30% of the daily caloric goal will be protein, 35% fat, and 35% carbohydrates.</description>
