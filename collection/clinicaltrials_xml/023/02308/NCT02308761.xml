  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TEN-010 is a small molecule, bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) bromodomain
      inhibitor. This study is designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of TEN-010 in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia
      (RR-AML) and hypomethylating agent (HMA)-refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In
      addition, this trial will assess response to treatment using International Working Group
      (IWG) response criteria. This study will be conducted in two parts: dose escalation and dose
      expansion. For dose escalation (Part A), a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design will be used in which
      successive cohorts of three or more patients with RR-AML or HMA-refractory MDS will be
      treated at escalating doses until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is identiﬁed. For the dose
      expansion part of the study (Part B), patients will be treated with TEN-010 at the MTD (or
      the highest dose tested if the MTD is not deﬁned) to further characterize its safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and clinical response. A maximum of 68 patients aged 18 years or older
      with RR-AML or HMA-refractory MDS will be enrolled in the study. In part A, up to 18 adult
      patients will be enrolled. This includes up to 18 RR-AML or HMA-refractory MDS patients
      enrolled in 3 dose levels of up to 6 patients each. In part B, up to 50 patients with RR-AML
      and HMA-refractory MDS will be enrolled in separate study groups of up to 25 patients each.
