      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of aclidinium bromide 400 μg BID
      compared with placebo on COPD symptoms in a symptomatic patients population with moderate
      COPD and chronic bronchitis, and particularly assess the effects in cough by using specific
      tools to assess the occurrence and impact of this relevant COPD symptom.
