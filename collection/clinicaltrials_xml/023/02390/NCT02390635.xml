      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if positron emission tomography/
      computed tomography (PET/CT) and whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to
      detect extramedullary myeloid leukemia (EML). EML is a type of cancer found outside of the
      bone marrow and can be hard to detect with routine bone marrow monitoring, such as bone
      marrow aspirations.

      If participant chooses to take part in this study, they will have a PET/CT scan and whole
      body MRI scan before they start their regular treatment.

      When participant arrives at the clinic for their PET/CT-MRI scans, they will receive a
      &quot;contrast&quot; solution by vein to make the images more accurate. If participant feels very
      nervous, the doctor may give them medication to help calm them down.

      Participant will first have the MRI scan, which will take about an hour. After that,
      participant will lie on a table so they can be moved into the room next door. Participant
      will then have the PET scan, which should take about 30 minutes.

      Participant and their regular doctor will be told if anything unusual is found in their
      scans, and the information will be put in their medical record.

      Information will also be collected from participant's medical record for at least 1 year
      after they complete the scans.

      This is an investigational study. The PET/CT and MRI scans on this study are performed using
      FDA-approved and commercially available methods. Using these scans to detect EML is
      considered investigational.

    <measure>Extramedullary Myeloid Leukemia (EML) Prevalence Assessed via Imaging with PET/CT, MR, and PET/MR Fusion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>EML prevalence assessed via imaging with PET/CT, MR, and PET/MR fusion, the latter serves as the gold standard. Follow up imaging, biopsies and clinical disposition also used to further confirm EML presence when available, but PET/MR fusion serves as the gold standard. Imaging criteria for presence of EML includes findings such as increased signal on T2 and DWI and enhancement on MR with increased 18F-FDG uptake on PET.</description>

    <description>Participants receive an injection of 18F-FDG prior to whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI images taken, then participants receive an injection of gadolinium contrast agent 2 mL/sec and 0.1 mmol/kg of body weight followed by a 20-cc saline flush. MRI images are then completed. Immediately following whole body MRI, standard positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) performed.</description>
