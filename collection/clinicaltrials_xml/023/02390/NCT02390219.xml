             the participant

          -  Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at screening that would interfere
             with the study assessments or pose an undue risk for the subject

             investigating lumacaftor and/or ivacaftor) within 30 days of screening.

          -  Use of strong inhibitors, moderate inducers, or strong inducers of CYP3A
