    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalation trial. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose of radiation received during stereotactic radiosurgery in patients
      with brain metastases who have never received radiation to the brain before.

    <description>Patients with 1-5 brain metastases will be treated. If a patient has multiple brain metastases, one of these lesions will be chosen at random to receive the experimental dose, as determined by size of that lesion (see Table 1).
Table 1: Dose Escalation Schema Cohort Dose Level 1 Dose Level 2 Dose Level 3 Dose Level 4 Cohort 1: &lt; 20 mm 26 Gy 28 Gy 30 Gy n/a Cohort 2: 21-30 mm 20 Gy 22 Gy 24 Gy n/a Cohort 3: 31-40 mm 17 Gy 19 Gy 21 Gy 23 Gy
Dose escalation will proceed in increments of 2 Gy per fraction up to a maximum dose of 30 Gy, 24 Gy, and 23 Gy for metastases &lt; 20 mm, 21-30 mm, and 31-40 mm respectively.
Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 may be enrolled simultaneously; however, 5 patients must be enrolled to each dose level and complete the 12 week DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) period before escalation can occur within a cohort.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically confirmed brain metastases by CT or MRI criteria. It is preferable if
             there is extra-cranial metastatic disease that the lesion be pathologically confirmed
             and reviewed at University of Utah or Huntsman Cancer Hospital if the pathology was
             obtained at an outside hospital.

          -  Prior brain surgery is allowed, although SRS (Stereotactic Radiosurgery) treatment to
             the operative bed would not be a &quot;tumor&quot; enrolled on the dose escalation portion of
             this trial. SRS would be delivered 4-6 weeks post-surgery if the patient had had a
             craniotomy for resection of a lesion. It is up to the PI's discretion to enroll a
             patient with SRS delivered outside of the 4-6 post-craniotomy window.

          -  1-5 brain metastases total

          -  Maximum tumor diameter &lt; 40mm by CT or MRI measurement, at the time of
             consultation/screening, for each metastatic lesion present in the brain

          -  All metastatic lesions must have a minimum distance between them of 3 cmm as measured
             from the peripheral edges of the lesions which are in closest proximity to one
             another. If there are multiple lesions and they are not all at least 3 centimeters
             away from each other, that patient will be deemed ineligible.

          -  Systemic therapy is allowed, although appropriate washout is required for patients
             who have been on BRAF ( inhibitors of at least 7 days.

          -  For subjects currently on active systemic cancer therapy, the treating medical
             oncologist should be consulted to ensure proper washout periods prior to SRS.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  KPS (Karnofsky Performance Status) &gt; 60

          -  Able to provide informed consent and have signed an approved consent form that
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 10 days
             of study enrollment and must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control while
             receiving radiation and for 3 months after radiation. Women of non-childbearing
             potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been
             postmenopausal for &gt;1 year.

          -  Men who are able to father a child must agree to use an acceptable method of birth
             control while receiving radiation, and for 3 months after radiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior whole/partial brain irradiation or stereotactic radiosurgery

          -  Brain lesions with a maximal diameter of &gt; 40 mm in size on MRI imaging at the time
             of consultation/screening for protocol eligibility.

          -  Lesion located in anatomic regions that are not amendable to SRS, including the brain
             stem, optic apparatus, or eloquent cortex

          -  Radiographic or cytologic evidence of leptomeningeal disease

          -  Primary lesion with radiosensitive histology that includes the following: small cell
             carcinoma, germ cell tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Patients with multiple lesions, which by size criteria would be enrolled in a cohort
             which is full at the time of enrollment and the 12 weeks DLT period has not been
             reached.
