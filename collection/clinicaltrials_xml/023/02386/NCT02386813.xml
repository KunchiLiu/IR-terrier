      This study is to explore risk factors for poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS) in ENKTL, and establish a prognostic model for ENKTL patients treated with
      non-anthracycline based treatment.

      This is a retrospective cohort study using anonymized information from patients with ENKTL.
      The following criteria are required: (1) Patients diagnosed with ENKTL, nasal type between
      January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2012; (2) Patients treated with non-anthracycline based
      therapy as an initial treatment. The pathology of initial diagnosis was reviewed by
      designated pathologists.

        1. Patients diagnosed with ENKTL, nasal type between January 1, 1995 and December 31,

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with ENKTL, nasal type

          -  Patients diagnosed between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2012

          -  Patients treated with nonanthracycline-based therapy as the initial treatment after
             diagnosis

          -  Nonanthracycline-based therapy includes the following treatments:

          -  Radiotherapy including concurrent chemoradiation

          -  Chemotherapy not including anthracycline such as doxorubicin (e.g. SMILE, VIPD) The
             type of salvage treatment will not be a criterion for exclusion. Thus, patients who
             had received various kinds of salvage treatment including anthracycline-containing
             regimens can be included. Patients who had undergone autologous or allogeneic stem
             cell transplantation can also be included in the analysis if they satisfy the
             above-mentioned inclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who had received anthracycline-based therapy, such as CHOP or CHOP-like
             regimens, as the initial treatment.

          -  Patients who do not have pathology slides available for central review.
