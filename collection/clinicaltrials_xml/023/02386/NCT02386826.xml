  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of two agents, INC280 and
      bevacizumab, are safe and effective when administered to patients who have received prior
      therapy for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), or
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and who have progressed after therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains an incurable malignancy with
      a short expected survival. Treatment options are also limited for patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) who have progressed after
      prior therapies. Novel targeted therapies are being studied to treat these patient
      populations. c-MET signalling promotes invasive growth and has been described in various
      cancers. INC280 is a highly potent and selective c-MET inhibitor which also penetrates the
      blood-brain barrier. In this open-label, multicenter Phase 1b study, investigators will
      first determine the optimal dose of INC280 combined with bevacizumab to administer as ≥
      second-line therapy for GBM/gliosarcoma patients. After the optimal dose of the drug
      combination is determined, enrollment will be expanded to include both GBM and mRCC patients
      who have progressed after ≥ first-line therapy, and mCRC patients who have progressed as ≥
      second-line therapy. The study will provide a preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic (PK)
      assessment of the INC280/bevacizumab combination.

    <description>The study is divided into two phases. (1) Dose Escalation Phase: Up to 18 ≥ 2nd-line GBM and gliosarcoma patients will receive bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) once every 2 weeks in combination with INC280. INC 280 will be administered orally (PO) starting at 100 mg twice daily and escalating on a 3+3 escalation pattern until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
(2) Dose Expansion Phase: Up to 45 patients will be enrolled across 3 cohorts. Cohort A: 15 patients with ≥ 2nd-line GBM or gliosarcoma; Cohort B: 15 patients with ≥ 3rd-line mCRC; and Cohort C: 15 patients with ≥ 2nd-line mRCC. INC280 will be administered orally (PO) twice daily in each cohort at the MTD determined in the dose escalation phase. INC280 will be combined with bevacizumab administered at 10 mg/kg IV once every 2 weeks. Treatment cycles will be repeated every 28 days (4 weeks).</description>
