  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the burden of disease, identify risk factors
      associated with nosocomial bacteremia among neonates and assess the efficacy of low-cost
      measures targeted to known and suspected nosocomial BSI (bloodstream) risk factors, the
      investigators propose to study the impact of a novel package of infection control
      interventions on nosocomial bacteremia and mortality among neonates at a tertiary care
      center in sub-Saharan Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an18 month prospective quasi-experimental evaluation of nosocomial bacteremia
      and mortality among hospitalized neonates and will consist of a 6-month baseline period to
      capture the incidence and all-cause mortality of nosocomial BSIs, a 1-month implementation
      period of low-cost infection control strategies (including alcohol-based hand rub [AHR], 2%
      chlorhexidine gluconate [CHG], hospital staff education and text message-based reminders of
      infection control recommendation) and an 11-month intervention period.

      All neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the University Teaching
      Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, Zambia during the study period will be eligible for study
      enrollment. This study will determine the capacity of an innovative bundle of low cost,
      simple and locally available interventions that leverage new technologies and expand
      application of highly effective interventions in order to reduce the incidence of nosocomial
      bacteremia among NICU patients in a developing country setting.
