  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that patients with GERD and/or Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EE) have lower
      esophageal impedance measurements when compared to patients who do not have GERD or EE.

      The overall goal of this project is to develop and assess a novel, inexpensive, minimally
      invasive technology to detect mucosal damage based on mucosal conductivity changes in the
      pediatric population. The study is based on preliminary work between Sandhill Scientific,
      Inc. and our adult gastroenterology department. They have collaborated to create a novel,
      minimally invasive Mucosal Impedance (MI) test (proprietary technology) based on animal
      studies which have shown esophageal tissue exposed to acidic and weakly acidic injurious
      agents causes dilation of intercellular spaces and loss of tight junctions along the
      squamous epithelial lining of the esophagus and results in measurable decreased baseline
      impedance.9 Adult studies have confirmed the correlation between decreased impedance and
      diseased tissue, however this has not been studied in children. We hypothesize that
      pediatric patients with histologic damage seen in GERD and EoE will have mucosal changes
      resulting in decreased electrical impedance compared to those with normal histology. We
      propose that this technology will accurately and reliably measure the mucosal consequence of
      chronic esophageal exposure to injurious gastroduodenal agents or food allergens. Thus, this
      test would serve as a minimally invasive screening tool for GERD and EoE prior to endoscopy,
      and allow longitudinal monitoring of mucosal response to therapy.
