  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the transcutaneous application of
      unmodulated 5 Kilohertz (KHz) alternating currents are effective in decreasing the thermal
      and mechanical experimental pain and cause changes in peripheral nerve conduction. Moreover
      evidence whether the effect and comfort of this current is greater than Conventional TENS
      (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) commonly used for the treatment of clinical
      pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last years several animal experimental studies have evidenced that high frequency
      unmodulated currents about 5 KHz can cause a peripheral nerve block. However electric
      currents with these high frequencies that are usually used for the treatment of pain in
      humans are interrupted or modulated (i.e. interferential currents)

      This evidences in animals could have application in pain treatment, characterized by
      overactive nervous system. For this reason it was decided to compare the effects on
      experimental pain and peripheral nerve conduction of this new electric current versus sham
      stimulation and TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation).

      The scientific literature on transcutaneous electrical stimulation in humans and changes in
      nerve conduction and / or somatosensory thresholds focuses mainly on TENS (Transcutaneous
      Electrical Nerve Stimulation). Therefore TENS is a good reference standard to compare the
      effect of this new currents.
