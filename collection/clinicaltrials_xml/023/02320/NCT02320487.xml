             thrombocytopenia, (b) Massive (i.e., greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 6 centimeters [cm]
             below the left costal margin) or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly, (c) Massive
             nodes (i.e., &gt;= 10 cm in longest diameter) or progressive or symptomatic
             lymphadenopathy, (d) Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of greater than (&gt;)
             50 percent (%) over a 2-month period or lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) of less than
             (&lt;) 6 months, (e) Autoimmune anemia and/or thrombocytopenia that is poorly responsive
             to corticosteroids or other standard therapy, (f) Constitutional symptoms, defined as
             any one or more of the following disease-related symptoms or signs: unintentional
             weight loss of &gt;=10% within the previous 6 months, significant fatigue (i.e., Eastern
             Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status [ECOG PS] of 2 or worse or the
             inability to work or perform usual activities), fevers higher than 100.5 degrees
             Fahrenheit (°F)/38.0 degrees Celsius (°C) for &gt;= 2 weeks without other evidence of

             cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac
             disease, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, or
