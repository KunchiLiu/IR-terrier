      The purpose of this study is to establish a non-invasive objective measurement for the
      detection of concussions with the Jan Medical Device (JMD). The study will assess the
      ability of this device to demonstrate unique signals that correlate with concussions. The
      study will also test the athletes at baseline at rest and during exertion to determine if
      there is a difference in the signal from exertion alone. The JMD is a non-invasive band that
      is placed around the participants head. The JMD detects a unique pattern of signals based on
      displacement of the skull from changes in blood flow during individual heartbeats. The
      athletes will be tested longitudinally to assess to changes over time, in addition to
      changes after impact

    <measure>Jan Medical's concussion algorithm</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 17 days of concusssion</time_frame>
    <description>Using SCAT 2 as the reference standard, the study sought to assess the ability of Jan Medical's concussion algorithm to detect a concussion within 17 days of onset as determined by SCAT 2 and the clinical judgment of the PI.</description>

    <time_frame>Individual assessments were made within 2 days of recording</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects recordings for this measure were those from the preseason when concussion free status was presumed and from several players at the end of the season who did not suffer a concussion.</description>
