  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      adenocarcinoma who have had tumor progression after first-line treatment with platinum and
      fluoropyrimidine doublet therapy. The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab
      prolongs progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for participants with
      tumors that show positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.
