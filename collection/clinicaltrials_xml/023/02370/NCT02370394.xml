  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will develop and assess an innovative, high-reach, easily implementable, low-cost
      computer-delivered intervention (Reach out for a Safe Environment; ROSE Program) that will
      address known barriers in early identification and intervention with perinatal women with
      IPV seeking treatment for mental illness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant social and public health problem among
      perinatal women. Research suggests that from 21% to 33% of perinatal women report IPV and
      there is an enormous amount of morbidity associated with IPV. Moreover, IPV places a woman
      at high risk for several psychiatric disorders, which transforms the perinatal period from
      an already challenging process into a potentially overwhelming one. Further, IPV and
      untreated mental illness during the perinatal period pose a dual risk of adverse physical
      and emotional outcomes for women and their developing fetus/infant. Experts in the field
      advocate for more IPV screening and intervention to take place among women who are at
      high-risk for IPV. Given the high rates of IPV among women who seek mental health treatment,
      mental health clinics compared to other medical settings (e.g. primary care) are more
      effective sites for focused case finding and intervention. Further, the presence of IPV
      increases the likelihood of disengagement from treatment, which could compromise the ability
      of women with IPV to effectively use important shelter and community resources necessary for
      establishing safety for themselves and their children. A timely intervention might reduce
      the risk of future IPV, improve treatment utilization, and reduce mental health symptoms. A
      brief intervention that is designed specifically for the unique needs of perinatal women
      with IPV seeking mental health treatment provides a tremendous opportunity to intervene with
      a group of women who are particularly vulnerable and who might be unusually open to making
      changes to their lives.

      The proposed study is the first step towards developing a computer-based brief intervention
      (&quot;Reach Out for a Safe Environment&quot;) that targets intimate partner violence in perinatal
      women in mental health treatment and constitutes the developmental aims of a larger study.
      The aims are to perform a small open trial (n = 8) of the Reach Out for a Safe Environment
      (ROSE) intervention to assess feasibility of recruitment of target population and
      acceptability of intervention and study procedures. Also, to conduct a randomized controlled
      pilot study in a sample of 50 perinatal women seeking mental health treatment who screen
      positive for recent IPV to demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of the ROSE
      intervention via participant report of ease of use, helpfulness, and overall satisfaction.

      We will collect several measures on the feasibility of the research design, the
      acceptability of ROSE, and on intervention effects for IPV severity and level of self-care
      strategies (primary outcomes), motivation and self efficacy (secondary outcomes), and use of
      recommended mental health treatment services (tertiary outcome). This phase uses a
      two-group, randomized, controlled design with an initial session for both conditions plus
      booster session one month later for the intervention condition. The initial intervention
      session will be conducted close to an intake visit for mental health difficulties, with a
      booster session within one month following baseline. There will be a 3-month follow up
      assessment. Assessments and the booster session will be conducted in a private room or at a
      location that is a convenient location for the woman and one that will provide a
      confidential, safe, and comfortable environment for the participant.

    <measure>Composite Abuse Scale (CAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and again three months later</time_frame>
    <description>A widely used self-report of behaviors that includes a 30-item scale with 4 subscales that measure severe, combined abuse, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and harassment. The CAS has recently been published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compendium of intimate partner violence measures. Items are presented in a six point format requiring respondents to answer &quot;never&quot;, &quot;only once&quot;, &quot;several times&quot;, &quot;monthly&quot;, &quot;weekly&quot; or &quot;daily&quot; in a three month period. The CAS will also be used to assess whether women have engaged in abusive behaviors towards their partners.</description>

    <description>The ROSE Program will be specifically tailored, innovative and relevant to diverse, racial and ethnic perinatal women in a number of ways including the images and content used in the intervention and coordinating study appointments with treatment visits. It will also be tailored on the current IPV risk assessment, pregnancy or postpartum status of each participant, will be designed to reach participants across levels of motivation for change. The content of ROSE will be theory-driven, consistent with the Motivational Interviewing model of behavior, and consistent with the literature on effective interventions that address IPV.</description>
