  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy may cause distressing symptoms which can impact on patients' quality of life.
      Chemotherapy is frequently given on an outpatient basis therefore patients are often
      required to manage the symptoms they experience at home without direct supervision from
      healthcare professionals. This study aims to evaluate the impact of a mobile phone based,
      remote monitoring, symptom management system (ASyMS) on the delivery of care to people with
      nonmetastatic breast, colorectal or haematological cancer during chemotherapy and for one
      year following treatment. The study aims to compare a number of outcomes of patients using
      the ASyMS intervention with outcomes of patients who receive normal care at their hospital.
      Throughout chemotherapy treatment, once a day and any other time they feel unwell, patients
      allocated to the mobile phone group will enter information on the phone regarding any
      symptoms they are experiencing, take their temperature and enter this on the phone. The
      information is sent via secure connection to a computer, which assesses the information and
      sends an alert to their health care professional in the hospital, who will call the patient
      at home if the patient has reported problematic symptoms. Patients in the normal care group
      will receive care as normal at their hospital. Both groups of patients will be asked to
      complete a series of questionnaires before they start treatment, after each chemotherapy
      cycle and at 3, 6, 9, 12 months after treatment completion (a subset of patients will also
      be asked to complete midcycle symptom assessments). The study will also evaluate the cost
      benefit of ASyMS, assess changes in clinical practice as a result of ASyMS and develop a
      predictive risk model (statistical model) for use in future care of patients receiving
      chemotherapy for these cancers. This multicentre study is taking place across a number of
      European countries.

             (for breast and colorectal cancers) and the Ann Arbor Staging System (for NHL/HD).
             Patients with metastatic disease will be excluded because of differences in symptom
             profiles experienced by people who have localised compared to advanced disease [42].
