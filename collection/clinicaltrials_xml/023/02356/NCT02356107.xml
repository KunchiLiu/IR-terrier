  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the administration of two widely available, naturally
      occurring dietary supplements, 5 hydroxytryptophan and creatine monohydrate, will reduce the
      severity of depression in individuals exposed to chronic hypoxia by living at altitude. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if 8 weeks of dietary augmentation with oral 5 g
      creatine daily and 100 mg 5-HTP twice daily reduces hypoxia-related depressive symptoms
      measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) in women with SSRI or
      SNRI-resistant depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serotonin and creatine are processed separately in the brain, and deficits in these brain
      biochemicals lead to distinct clinical problems. Therefore, investigators believe that
      treatment with a combination therapy, which could correct both deficits, would have a
      synergistic effect in the treatment of hypoxia-related depression and possibly other forms
      of treatment-resistant depression. Thus, investigators propose to investigate antidepressant
      efficacy of dietary 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and creatine, as a means to restore the
      brain neurotransmitter and metabolic imbalances linked to chronic hypoxia caused by high
      altitude residence.
