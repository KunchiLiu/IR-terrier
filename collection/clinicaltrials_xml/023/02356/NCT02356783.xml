  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim is to assess usability and compliance of a wireless pedometer for monitoring step
      count after a lumbar epidural steroid injection for the treatment of radicular pain in low
      back pain patients. Our main hypothesis is to demonstrate pedometer measured step count can
      be used to measure efficacy of pain interventions.
