  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failed fusion and failure to relieve back pain following spinal fusion are still frequent,
      irrespective of the type of procedures or grafts used by the surgeon. Moreover, revision
      surgeries are unfortunately associated with higher procedure-related complication rates,
      technical difficulties, longer operative time, and quite disappointing and unreliable
      success rates for both fusion and clinical results.

      The present Phase 2a study aims at demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ALLOB®, a
      proprietary population of allogeneic osteoblastic cells, in rescue interbody fusion.
