  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental healthcare is severely neglected in resource-limited countries, including Nepal.
      Nepali clinicians typically spend little time during their clinical education on mental
      diseases. The authors conducted a needs assessment of Primary Care Providers (PCPs) at a
      district level hospital in Nepal using focus group discussions, which revealed clinical
      deficiencies in providing mental healthcare. The authors will develop and implement
      computer-based educational modules to provide training in mental health for Nepali PCPs.
      Effectiveness of PCPs' comfort level, knowledge and skills in evaluating, diagnosing and
      managing mental illness will be assessed by administering pre- and post-tests.
      Acceptability, feasibility and PCPs' comfort-level with the educational modality will also
      be assessed. Data from the tests will be analyzed using paired t-tests. Additionally, data
      from the focus group discussions will be further analyzed to assess for themes that might be
      common among PCPs in other parts of rural Nepal, or regions where access to psychiatrists is
      very limited.
