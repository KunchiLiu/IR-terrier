  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trials are critical to informing the care of patients with cancer. However, only
      3-5% of patients with cancer enroll in clinical trials. Poor accrual to trials has major
      implications with regards to the pace of progress, the cost of clinical cancer research, and
      the generalizability of results. The investigators have recently shown in an analysis of
      7,776 cancer clinical trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov that approximately 20% of
      cancer clinical trials fail to complete enrollment at all; the most often cited reason was
      poor accrual.

      Prior research has identified barriers to cancer clinical trial accrual that can be
      generally categorized in the domains of availability, awareness, and acceptance. Much
      attention has been paid to the barriers involvement awareness and acceptance - however,
      trial availability is likely a &quot;rate limiting step&quot;. This pilot study is the first in a
      series of planned steps to attempt to shift the current paradigm of &quot;bringing patients to
      trials&quot; to &quot;bringing trials to patients.&quot; With the integration of telemedicine visits, the
      investigators aim to decrease the burden of participation for patients, begin to address
      geographic barriers, and ultimately improve trial accrual. In this study, men with
      biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (a rising PSA after definitive local therapy) will
      receive the antidiabetic drug, metformin. Patients will require a single on-site visit for
      study enrollment. The remainder of the 6 month study will be conducted via a HIPPA secure
      telemonitoring system (monthly visits conducted via telemedicine with tablet computers
      provided to each patients).

    <textblock>
      Men with an isolated PSA recurrence after local therapy are an ideal population for the
      evaluation of novel therapies given the minimal disease burden, generally indolent natural
      history, and patients' preference to avoid the adverse effects of androgen deprivation
      therapy. Metformin has shown anti-prostate cancer activity in preclinical models and cohort
      studies. Metformin, a biguanide oral antihyperglycemic agent, abrogates hyperinsulinemia in
      individuals with and without diabetes and has shown promising anti-prostate cancer activity
      in preclinical models, epidemiologic studies, and retrospective cohorts. Several
      epidemiologic/retrospective studies have shown that metformin has a positive impact on
      overall survival among men with prostate cancer.

      These nonclinical and clinical studies have led to calls for prospective studies of
      metformin in patients with prostate cancer. This is a pilot telemedicine study of metformin
      in patients with a rising PSA (&quot;biochemical recurrence&quot;) after definitive local therapy for
      prostate cancer.

      The current study is supported by the following rationale:

        -  A large proportion of clinical trials close prematurely due to poor accrual.

        -  Geographic inaccessibility is a barrier to clinical trial participation.

        -  Metformin is a safe and inexpensive medication that has demonstrated anti-prostate
           cancer activity in nonclinical and epidemiologic studies. Importantly, metformin has
           been shown to be safe in non-diabetic patients (e.g., patients with polycystic ovary
           disease) and does not cause hypoglycemia.

        -  Use of novel technologies may facilitate clinical trial accrual and minimize the burden
           of participation for patients. Ultimately, these approaches may also decrease the cost
           of drug development and increase the pace of progress.

      In the absence of prohibitive toxicities or disease progression (defined in 4.4), patients
      may continue treatment for the 6-month study period. This study will include a baseline
      visit for study enrollment at Mount Sinai. The remainder of the visits will be telemedicine
      visits conducted using secure video conferencing.
