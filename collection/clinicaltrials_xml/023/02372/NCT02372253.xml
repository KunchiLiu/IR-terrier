  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of using oral
      verapamil in subjects with recent onset T1D in order to downregulate TXNIP and enhance the
      patients' endogenous beta cell mass and insulin production. The objectives are therefore to
      assess parameters of beta cell survival (including new biomarkers), insulin production and
      glucose control and the feasibility of this approach and thereby provide the basis for
      future, larger/expanded, longer-term verapamil studies and the off-label use of this
      approved drug for T1D.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loss of pancreatic beta-cell mass is a key factor in T1D, but therapies to halt this process
      are not available. The investigators have discovered thioredoxin-interacting protein
      (TXNIP), as a promising target in this regard and have now found that the commonly used
      anti-hypertensive drug and calcium channel-blocker, verapamil, effectively lowers beta-cell
      TXNIP expression in rodent beta-cells and human islets, promotes beta-cell survival and
      rescues mice from T1D. This makes verapamil a potentially attractive drug for T1D, but
      prospective clinical data are lacking. The investigators primary objective is therefore to
      conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of
      verapamil in adults with recent-onset T1D and to demonstrate that subjects on oral verapamil
      daily for 12 months will have improved insulin production (as an indirect measure of
      beta-cell mass). The investigators preliminary specific aims include: #1 Assessment of
      remaining endogenous beta-cell mass/insulin production as measured by the change from
      baseline in mixed meal-stimulated C peptide, and by exogenous insulin requirements in
      verapamil and placebo treated subjects at Week 12 and Month 12. #2 Assessment of glycemic
      control as measured by mean amplitude glycemic excursions and hypoglycemic event rate (CGMS
      and subject-reported) and HbA1c at Week 12 and Month 12. #3 Evaluation of non-invasive
      markers for therapeutic follow-up and beta-cell mass, i.e. TXNIP expression in peripheral
      blood monocytes at baseline, Week 12 and Month 12, and collection of serum for future
      assessment of potential beta-cell markers (proinsulin/C-peptide ratio, demethylated insulin
      DNA, and microRNAs). Results will have major translational implications with potential
      immediate impact on clinical care, encourage large clinical follow-up trials, evaluate
      markers of beta cell health and ultimately help develop a novel therapy that enhances the
      patient's own beta-cell mass and function.

    <description>TXNIP expression in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs). Since TXNIP is ubiquitously expressed and we already have observed that verapamil is capable of downregulating TXNIP in non-pancreatic tissues we will use this measurement as a marker of the verapamil effects</description>
