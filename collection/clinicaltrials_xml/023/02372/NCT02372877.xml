  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the AMICUS Red Blood Cell
      Exchange (RBCx) System (Exchange and Depletion/Exchange procedures) in patients with sickle
      cell disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of Red Blood Cell Exchange is to remove a patient's red blood cells (RBCs) and
      replace the blood volume removed with either healthy donor RBCs and/or colloid/crystalloid
      solutions. Depending on the RF used, the procedure can be considered an RBC Exchange or RBC
      Depletion/Exchange procedure. The RBC Depletion/Exchange procedure is a modification of the
      RBC Exchange procedure. The AMICUS RBCx protocol provides the ability to use various RFs
      including healthy donor RBCs or a combination of fluids, such as saline followed by RBCs. In
      RBC Exchange and the exchange portion of the RBC Depletion/Exchange procedures, RBC units
      are used as the RF, while colloid and/or crystalloid solutions are used as the RF in the
      depletion portion of the RBC Depletion/Exchange procedures. A new operating protocol on the
      AMICUS Separator that enables the device to perform Red Blood Cell Exchange (RBCx)
      procedures in accordance with the replacement fluid(s) (RF) prescribed by a physician for
      patients with sickle cell disease

          -  Subjects â‰¥18 years old.

          -  Subjects with documented diagnosis of a type of sickle cell disorder who require RBC
             Exchange or RBC Depletion/Exchange treatment.

          -  Medically stable subjects who have been previously treated for sickle cell disease
             with RBC Exchange or RBC Depletion/Exchange.

          -  Subjects, or subject's legal representative, who have provided signed informed
             consent, and assent when applicable, prior to participation.
