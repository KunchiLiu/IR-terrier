  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is very common in persons with a history of addiction, but few studies have examined
      the best treatment of pain in this population. This is a study to determine the pain relief
      provided by intravenous hydromorphone (Dilaudid) or buprenorphine given to persons
      maintained on stable doses of methadone or buprenorphine who have chronic musculoskeletal
      pain. Experimental sessions will require overnight stays on a residential research unit. In
      these sessions, persons will be exposed to standard experimental pain techniques at baseline
      and then rate the relief (if any) provided by the study medication when exposed to the same
      techniques. Persons will be asked to participate in 3 sessions, each separated by at least 7
      days.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cold pressor test</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured 7 times during each 40-hour session. On average, all sessions will be completed within 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The participant places a hand up to the wrist in a circulating water bath maintained at approximately 4 degrees Celsius (up to 5 minutes). The time at which pain develops is the threshold. The time a volunteer's hand remains underwater before pain is unbearable is tolerance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured 7 times during each 40-hour session. On average, all sessions will be completed within 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>An electronic algometer (Somedic; Horby, Sweden) with a 1cm2 hard rubber probe will be used to assess responses to noxious mechanical pressure on the trapezius and forearm. Pressure is gradually increased at a constant rate (30kPA/sec); the average threshold and tolerance across 2 trials will be calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Thermal pain</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured 7 times during each 40-hour session. On average, all sessions will be completed within 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>All contact heat stimuli will be delivered using the FDA approved Medoc thermal stimulator (Ramat Yishai, Israel) on the dorsal forearm or dorsum of the foot. The thermode's temperature gradually increases (0.5oC/sec) until no longer tolerated (max 51 degrees Celsius). The average threshold and tolerance across 2 trials will be calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Temporal summation</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured 7 times during each 40-hour session. On average, all sessions will be completed within 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Temporal summation involves rapidly applying a series of identical noxious stimuli in the same area to determine the increase in pain across trials. For temporal summation of mechanical pain, pain ratings in response to a single punctuate noxious stimulus will be compared to pain ratings in response to a sequence of identical punctuate noxious stimuli. A weighted pinprick stimulator with a flat contact area of 0.2 mm diameter and a force of 256 mN will be used to deliver, to the dorsal surface of the hand, either a single pinprick stimulus or a train of 10 pinprick stimuli repeated at a 1/s rate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured 7 times during each 40-hour session. On average, all sessions will be completed within 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>DNIC refers to the phenomenon of one noxious stimulus inhibiting the pain of a second noxious stimulus. Baseline responses to a brief painful stimulus (e.g., algometer on right trapezius) are evaluated and then re-assessed during application of a tonic noxious stimulus (e.g., cold pressor test with left hand).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scales (VAS) of subjective drug effects</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured 7 times during each 40-hour session. On average, all sessions will be completed within 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>VAS are single item questions that assessed subjective drug effects at the time of scale completion. Ratings are entered into a computer by the participant positioning an arrow along a 100 mm line marked at either end with &quot;none&quot; (0) and &quot;extremely&quot; (100).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pupil diameter</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured 13 times during each 40-hour session. On average, all sessions will be completed within 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed with a digital pupillometer (Neuroptics, Inc.) in constant room lighting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured 7 times during each 40-hour session. On average, all sessions will be completed within 4 weeks.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Profile of mood states (POMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured 7 times during each 40-hour session. On average, all sessions will be completed within 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of 72 adjectives commonly used to describe momentary mood states. Participants rate from 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vital signs</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at baseline and every 15 minutes during experimental pain testing. Testing will occur during 10 hours of each 40-hour session. Sessions will be separated by at least 7 days.</time_frame>
    <description>These include blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and oxygen saturation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trait pain catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured once during the screening visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) will be administered at screening to measure trait levels of catastrophizing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Money versus drug questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>This question will be asked once at the end of the session and again on the following day.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to indicate on a sliding scale a monetary value above which they would prefer money and below which they would prefer the drug they received during the experimental session.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>End of session questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>This question will be asked once at the end of the session and again on the following day.</time_frame>
    <description>the participants will be asked to reflect on their experience and answer a series of questions on the subjective effects of the study drug, the degree to which they would take the drug again, and to estimate the amount of money the drug effect would be worth on the street.</description>
