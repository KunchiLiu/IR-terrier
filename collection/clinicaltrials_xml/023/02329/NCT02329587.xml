    <textblock>
      This study is investigating whether combining noninvasive brain stimulation with behavior
      therapy can help to improve outcomes for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Exposure and
      response prevention (ERP) -- a specific type of behavior therapy -- is a first line
      treatment for OCD. This study will test whether a form of noninvasive brain stimulation
      called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), can help ERP work better.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current primary OCD diagnosis and current Y-BOCS total score of â‰¥16

          -  18-65 years of age

          -  Ability to speak, read, write, and understand English sufficiently well to complete
             study procedures and provide informed consent

             of 6 week prior to study entry. Psychiatric medications will be limited to the
             following: serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI; including clomipramine), combination
             antidepressants (including bupropion and SNRIs), buspirone, benzodiazepines, and/or
             stimulants (standing doses)

          -  Naive to tDCS

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active substance use disorder

          -  Lifetime diagnosis of psychotic or bipolar mood disorder

          -  Previous minimally adequate trial of ERP (e.g., at least 16 sessions including both
             therapist and self-directed exposure and response prevention)

          -  Therapy outside the study protocol which has evidence for efficacy with OCD during
             the study intervention period

          -  Active suicidal or homicidal ideation

          -  Organic brain disease or injury

          -  Any health problems that would interfere with study participation, including
             contraindications to tDCS (e.g., skin condition, mental implant in skull)

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. All women participants of child-bearing age
             are required to have a negative pregnancy test prior to treatment, and must use
             medically acceptable birth control during study participation. Medically acceptable
             birth control includes: established oral, injected, implanted, or vaginal ring
             hormonal contraception, an intrauterine device (IUD), two barrier contraception
             methods (condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository),
             or having a vasectomized partner

          -  Use of anticonvulsant medications (including depakote, gabapentin, tegretol,
             dilantin, lamictal) and/or glutamate-acting agents (including n-acetylcysteine,
             riluzole, amantadine, memantine).
