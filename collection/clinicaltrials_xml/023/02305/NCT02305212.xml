    <textblock>
      This study will examine a cognitive rehabilitation protocol targeted at working memory
      deficits for adults and children with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). In this randomized
      clinical trial, the efficacy of Cogmed, a cognitive rehabilitation protocol designed to
      improve working memory, will be examined in children with TBI. Neuropsychological and daily
      life functioning will be measured. Participants will be children (N=20) and adults (N=20)
      with a documented history of TBI. Participants will be randomized to a treatment group or a
      wait list control group. The Experimental Group will receive the Cogmed working memory
      training program 30-40 minutes per day, 5 days a week for 5 weeks for a total training time
      of approximately 15 hours. The Control Group will be a wait list control group that will
      cross over into treatment after the follow-up assessment. All subjects will undergo repeat
      assessments following completion of the working memory training protocol after the 7th week
      and again at 13 weeks to document changes in working memory performance.
