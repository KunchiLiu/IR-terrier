  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to verify the efficacy of ASP015K versus placebo
      administrated in combination with methotrexate (MTX) over placebo in terms of efficacy in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had an inadequate response to MTX

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group,
      confirmatory study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP015K administered in
      combination with MTX in patients with RA who had an inadequate response to MTX.

      Subjects will orally receive ASP015K or placebo once daily (QD) in combination with MTX
      after breakfast for 52 weeks.

      At Week 12, inadequate responders in the placebo group, as determined by a &lt; 20% improvement
      from baseline (i.e., treatment initiation day) in tender or painful joint count (TJC) and
      swollen joint count (SJC), will be switched to ASP015K, and the dosage will be maintained
      until the end of treatment. In addition, subjects receiving placebo at Week 28 will be
      switched to ASP015K, and the dosage will be maintained until the end of treatment.

      The ASP015K dose that will be started for placebo group subjects at Week 12 or Week 28 will
      be randomly chosen at baseline. The dose will be switched under the blinded condition.

      Subjects who complete this study will be eligible for participation in the open-label
      extension study (015K-CL-RAJ2). Subjects will make a follow-up visit after the Week 52 visit
      if they do not enroll into the extension study on the day of the Week 52 visit
