    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study (regulatory
      post-marketing surveillance) in approximately 3,000 patients who are to receive Kadcyla
      (trastuzumab emtansine). Patients with HER2-positive, unresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer, who have received prior treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane,
      and administered Kadcyla infusion at physician's discretion will be registered for this
      surveillance in Korea. Patients will be asked to provide informed consent; data will be
      collected by electronic Case Report Forms for approximately 6 years.
