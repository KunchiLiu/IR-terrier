  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mepolizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that exhibits
      dose proportional and time-independent pharmacokinetics. The study will be conducted in 2
      parts. Part A: it will be pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study conducted to
      support the use of mepolizumab in children aged 6 to 11 years with severe eosinophilic
      asthma and characterize the PK/PD of mepolizumab 40 milligrams (mg) or 100 mg administered
      subcutaneously depending on participant body weight. Part B: It is a long-term safety /
      pharmacodynamic phase in which extended treatment for a further 52 weeks will be offered on
      an optional basis to those subjects eligible for continued treatment. Participants with
      bodyweight &lt;40 kilogram (kg) will be dosed with mepolizumab 40 mg and participants with body
      weight &gt;=40 kg will be dosed with mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously in upper arm or thigh at
      Visit 2 (Week 0). Approximately 40 male or female participants aged 6 to 11 years will be
      screened to achieve approximately 28 eligible participants entering the treatment phase to
      allow availability of 20 evaluable participants, with a minimum of six participants enrolled
      in the &lt;40 kg bodyweight group. The total duration of the study will be 22 weeks and will
      include a run-in period of 1-2 weeks, a treatment period of 12 weeks and a follow-up phase
      of 8 weeks. A participant will be considered having completed the study if the participant
      completes all phases of the study including the follow-up phase (Week 20 [visit 8]).

          -  Diagnosis of severe asthma, defined by the regional asthma guidelines (i.e., National
             Institute of Health (NIH), Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), etc.), for at least
             12 months prior to Visit 1. If the participant is naïve to the study site, the
             participant/guardian must self-report a physician diagnosis of asthma and the
             investigator must confirm by review of medical history with the participant/guardian.

          -  Eosinophilic airway inflammation that is related to asthma characterized as
             eosinophilic in nature as indicated by: elevated peripheral blood eosinophil count of
             &gt;=300 cells per microliter (cells/μL) demonstrated in the past 12 months OR elevated
             peripheral blood eosinophil count of &gt;=150/μL at visit 1.

          -  A well-documented requirement for regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroid (&gt;200
             μg/day fluticasone propionate drug powder inhaler [DPI] or equivalent daily) in the
             12 months prior to Visit 1 with or without maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS).
             The ICS dose should represent medium or high dose in children aged 6-11 years of age
             [GINA, 2015].

          -  Current treatment with an additional controller medication for at least 3 months or a
             documented failure in the past 12 months of an additional controller medication for
             at least 3 successive months. [e.g., long-acting beta-2-agonist (LABA), leukotriene
             receptor antagonist (LTRA), or theophylline.]

          -  Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1): Persistent airflow obstruction at
             either Visit 1 or Visit 2 (FEV1 performed prior to first dose of study medication) as
             indicated by: A pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt;110% predicted (Quanjer, 2012) OR FEV1:
             Forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt;0.8.

          -  Previously confirmed history of two or more exacerbations requiring treatment with
             systemic corticosteroids (CS) (intramuscular [IM], intravenous, or oral), in the 12
             months prior to visit 1, despite the use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).
             For participants receiving maintenance CS, the CS treatment for the exacerbations
             must have been a two-fold increase or greater in the dose.

          -  No changes in the dose or regimen of baseline ICS and/or additional controller
             medication during the run-in period.

          -  Male or female: Females of childbearing potential must commit to consistent and
             correct use of an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the trial
             and for 4 months after the last dose of investigational product. A urine pregnancy
             test is required of girls of childbearing potential. This test will be performed at
             the initial screening visit (visit 1) and will be performed at each scheduled study
             visit prior to the administration of investigational product, and during the early
             withdrawal and follow-up visits.

          -  Parent(s)/guardian able to give written informed consent prior to participation in
             the study, which will include the ability to comply with the requirements and
             restrictions listed in the consent form. If applicable, the participant must be able
             and willing to give assent to take part in the study according to the local
             requirement.

          -  For Part B: The subject has completed all study assessments up-to and including Visit
             8 and received all 3 doses of investigational product (IP) in Part A

          -  For Part B: The Principal Investigator (PI) has performed a benefit/risk assessment
             and this assessment supports continued therapy with mepolizumab.

          -  The subject's parents (or guardian) have given consent and the subject has given
             assent for continued treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with any medical condition or circumstance making the volunteer
             unsuitable for participation in the study.

          -  Significant abnormality of rate, interval, conduction or rhythm in the 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG), determined by the investigator in conjunction with the age
             and gender of the child at Visit 1.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and bilirubin &gt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN)

             substance abuse, or other condition (e.g. inability to read, comprehend and write)
             which will limit the validity of consent to participate in this study.

          -  Unwillingness or inability of the participant or parent/guardian to follow the
             procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Participant who is mentally or legally incapacitated.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Hypersensitivity: Participants with allergy/intolerance to a monoclonal antibody or
             biologic.

          -  The participant has participated in a clinical trial and has received an
