    <measure>Change in ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>AISRS: an 18-item scale administered by the investigator. It included 9 items that evaluated symptoms of inattention and 9 items that evaluated symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity. Each item was rated from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). AISRS total score was calculated as sum of all the items on the scale and ranged from 0 to 54. A higher score corresponded to a worse severity of ADHD</description>

    <measure>Overall functioning: Change in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS comprises a series of patient rated scales designed to measure impairment. The patient rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities and 3) home life or family responsibilities are impaired on a 10-point visual analogue scale, on which 0 = normal functioning and 10 = severe functional impairment. A higher score represents more severe functional impairment.</description>

    <measure>Productivity: Change in Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ) using the Productivity Loss score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ) is a patient self-rated scale designed to assess on-the-job impact of chronic health problems and/or treatment. The WLQ consists of 25 items in 4 dimensions: limitations handling time (5 items), physical work demands (6 items), mental-interpersonal work demands (9 items), and output demands (5 items). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale from All of the Time to None of the Time, or Does Not Apply to My Job. Each dimension is scored on a scale of 0 (limited at work none of the time) to 100 (limited at work all of the time) based on a converted mean score. A higher score indicates more work limitation.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) provides the clinician's impression of the patient's current state of mental illness.

             disorders or systemic medical diseases that are, in the investigator's opinion,
