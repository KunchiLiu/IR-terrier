  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral Mucositis (OM) is a painful and debilitating side effect of many of the drug/radiation
      regimens used to treat cancer. This study examines the investigational drug brilacidin and
      its possible application in prevention of oral mucositis in patients undergoing
      chemoradiation for treatment of head and neck cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether daily oral rinses with a solution containing brilacidin will
      prevent the occurrences of OM or lessen the severity of OM if it occurs. Patients will use
      an oral rinse 3 times daily for up to seven weeks during chemoradiation for head and neck
      cancer.

          1. Willing and able to read, understand and sign an informed consent form (ICF)

          2. Have recently diagnosed (within previous 6 months) pathologically confirmed,
             non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx,
             or supraglottic larynx that will be treated with CRT therapy as first line
             non-surgical treatment. Scans (CT, PET, and/or MRI) obtained within 120 days prior to
             consent for screening can be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          3. Have a plan to receive a continuous course of conventional external beam irradiation
             delivered by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as single daily fractions of 2.0
             Gy to 2.2 Gy with a cumulative radiation dose ≥55 Gy and ≤72 Gy. Planned radiation
             treatment fields must include at least two oral sites (buccal mucosa, floor of mouth,
             ventral/lateral tongue, soft palate). [Note: the independent RTQA consultant must
             confirm that the planned radiation treatment meets the protocol criteria]

          4. Have a plan to receive a standard cisplatin chemotherapy regimen administered weekly
             (30-40 mg/m2) or approximately every 21 days (80-100 mg/m2)

          5. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.
             However, potential subjects with an ECOG of 3 may be enrolled provided their
             condition does not preclude performing the actions required by study participation

          7. Urine or serum pregnancy test: negative for female patients of childbearing potential

          8. Agree to utilize medically accepted methods of birth control during study
             participation and for 90 days following the last treatment with study drug if a
             female subject is of childbearing potential or if a male subject has an opposite sex
             partner of child bearing potential.

          9. Males or females aged ≥18 years on day of consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has tumor(s) of the lips, sinuses, salivary glands, nasopharynx, glottic larynx,
             subglottic larynx or unknown primary tumor

          2. Has metastatic disease (M1) Stage IV C

          6. Has a history of other malignant tumors within the last 5 years, except non melanoma
             skin cancer or in situ cervical carcinoma curatively excised

          7. Has had a major surgical procedure, other than for HNC, or significant traumatic
             injury within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of RT; anticipation of need for major
             surgical procedure during the course of the study

          8. Has incompletely healed sites of dental extractions

             abnormality(ies) (e.g. left bundle branch block, frequent premature ventricular
             contractions, QTc interval prolongation &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 msec for
             females)

         10. Has untreated hypertension or has hypertension under treatment that meets protocol

         15. Use of any investigational agent within 30 days of randomization

         16. Is pregnant or breastfeeding

             requirements for follow-up visits.

         20. Is unwilling or unable to agree to swish and spit the study oral rinse three times
