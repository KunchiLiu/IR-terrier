  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical
      study of single-agent RO6958688 in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic
      CEA-positive solid tumors who have progressed on standard treatment, are intolerant to
      standard of care (SOC), and/or are non-amenable to SOC. The study will be conducted in two
      parts. Part 1 will investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of RO6958688
      in single patient cohorts. Part 2 will establish the appropriate therapeutic dose(s) based
      on safety, pharmacokinetics, and the maximum tolerated dose of RO6958688 for the weekly
      schedule. The anticipated time on treatment is a maximum of 24 months. The overall target
      sample size is 90.
