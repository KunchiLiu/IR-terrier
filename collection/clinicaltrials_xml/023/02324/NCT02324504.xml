    <textblock>
      This study will enroll up to 192 children less than 18 years of age, who will receive
      electrocardiographic guidance for placement of a PICC in addition to radiography done as
      standard care. The investigators will determine the location of the PICC tip from both ECG
      and radiograph, and then measure the degree of correlation between the two methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The placement of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) is an important component
      of medical care for a variety of patients. Current practice requires radiographic
      confirmation of catheter tip placement prior to use of the line for administration of
      medications. Often the final catheter tip position may be uncertain based on radiographic
      imaging. Other times, the catheter is malpositioned and requires adjustment and repeat
      radiographic imaging. In adult patients, a system of confirmation that is based on
      electrocardiographic activity has been implemented and is FDA approved. This study will
      enroll up to 192 children less than 18 years of age, who will receive electrocardiographic
      guidance for placement of a PICC, in addition to radiography done as standard care. The
      investigators will determine the location of the PICC tip from both ECG and radiograph, and
      then measure the degree of correlation between the two methods.

    <description>The C3 Wave PICC tip detection system will be used to identify catheter tip location during the procedural placement of the catheter. This system includes an ECG monitor that will connected to the guidewire used for catheter placement. The changes in the ECG tracing will guide correct catheter placement.</description>
