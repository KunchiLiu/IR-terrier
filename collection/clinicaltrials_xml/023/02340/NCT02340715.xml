  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it would be helpful to use advanced MRI imaging
      techniques to take additional views of the tumor target for radiation treatment planning or
      treatment follow-up MRI.

      The results of this research project will be used to establish a standard MRI protocol
      specific to each tumor or disease site. An MRI protocol is a list of MR image types that are
      acquired for each disease site. These images are used to generate the patient's treatment
      plan.
