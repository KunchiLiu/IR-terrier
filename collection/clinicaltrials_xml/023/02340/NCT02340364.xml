    <textblock>
      The investigators are asking subjects to take part in the Patient NAVIgation to Reduce
      Readmissions among Black Men with Heart Failure (NAVI-HF) research study. This research
      study will test how well trained laypeople working as patient navigators will help patients
      recently hospitalized for heart failure avoid future hospitalizations. NAVI-HF is a new
      program sponsored by funding from the National Institute of Minority Health and Health
      Disparities. People who enter into the study will work with a patient navigator to undergo
      the full program or work with a trained layperson to receive general education on heart
      disease treatment and prevention. The purpose of the study is to determine whether a patient
      navigation program will be effective in reducing the number of hospitalizations in the
      future for program participants. This study will enroll 416 participants from UAB.

      Therefore, in the Patient NAVIgation to Reduce Readmissions among Black Men with Heart
      Failure (NAVI-HF) study, the investigators propose to recruit 416 AA men with HF receiving
      inpatient care at UAB Hospital and randomize them either to HF self-care education plus a
      patient navigator-delivered self-care plan (Education + PN arm) or to HF self-care education
      alone (Educational Control arm). The investigators will compare participant outcomes such as
      all-cause and HF readmission rates, HF self-care adherence as well as cost effectiveness
      across the two intervention arms. Our Specific Aims are:

        1. To assess the 30-day all-cause readmission rates among male African American HF
           patients receiving HF self-care education plus a patient navigator-delivered self-care
           plan versus HF self-care education alone

        2. To assess the HF self-efficacy and heart failure self-care adherence among male African
           American HF patients receiving HF self-care education plus a patient
           navigator-delivered self-care plan versus HF self-care education alone

        3. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HF self-care education plus a patient
           navigator-delivered self-care plan versus HF self-care education alone
