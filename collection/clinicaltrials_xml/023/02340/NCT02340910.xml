      This study will enroll people with SCI who are receiving physical therapy/exercise training.
      The goal is to understand if standing on a platform and receiving WBV prior to training
      results in decreased spasticity and improved walking ability compared to training alone.

      Phase 1 of this study has been successfully completed. The results of Phase 1 indicate that
      the combination of high-frequency (50Hz) and long duration 6 minutes (delivered in eight
      45-sec bouts) of WBV was associated with the largest change in spasticity (as measured by
      the pendulum test). It also seems feasible that WBV would serve as a priming stimulus to
      increase responsiveness to training.

      The goal for Phase 2 is to understand if adding WBV to physical therapy/exercise training
      results in decreased spasticity and improved walking ability compared to the training alone.
      Two different doses of WBV, a short dose and a long dose will be tested.

    <description>During each WBV repetition, subjects will stand on the vibration platform of the WBV device with knees slightly bent (approximately 30 degrees flexion). The subject will hold the handrails for balance and the WBV device will be turned on. The subject will receive a total of 6 minutes of WBV at a frequency of 50 Hz. Interventions will occur prior to either physical therapy training (in the Shepherd STEP program) for 5 days a week for 2 weeks or to exercise training (in the Shepherd Beyond Therapy program) for 3 days a week for 2 weeks.</description>

The subject will hold the handrails for balance and the WBV device will be turned on. The subject will receive a total of 12 minutes of WBV at a frequency of 50 Hz.

          -  be between the ages of 16 - 65 years old.

          -  be able to stand for at least one minute using the upper extremities for balance
             only.

          -  be able to move one leg at least a small amount using whatever devices are most
             helpful for you.

          -  have at least mild spasticity affecting the lower extremity muscles.

          -  be able to transfer from sit to stand requiring no more than moderate assistance of
             one person.

          -  be able to understand and provide own consent

          -  You may participate if you use prescription medications, including baclofen pump for
             control of spasticity, as the dosage is stable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  progressive or potentially progressive spinal lesions, including degenerative, or
             progressive vascular disorders of the spine and/or spinal cord.

          -  neurologic level below spinal level T12

          -  history of cardiovascular irregularities

          -  problems following instructions

          -  orthopedic problems that would limit your participation in the protocol (e.g. knee or
             hip flexion contractures of greater than 10 degrees).
