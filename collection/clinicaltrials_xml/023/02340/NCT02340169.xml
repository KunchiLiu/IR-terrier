    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of Topicort® (desoximetasone)
      Topical Spray, 0.25% to suppress hypothalmic pituitary adrenal axis function. The secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the efficacy parameters, pharmacokinetics and adverse event
      profile.
