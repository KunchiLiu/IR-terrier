    <textblock>
      As part of mandatory on-going nursing education, the investigators have incorporated
      identical information into two distinct web-based learning formats - the traditional linear
      PowerPoint format (with voice-over) and a new interactive format developed with central
      nursing education.

      The investigators will cluster randomize nurses by floor to receive either the traditional
      education or the new interactive education, and evaluate the impact on administration of VTE
      prophylaxis doses administered by nurses before and after education. All nurses on a floor
      will receive the same educational format. If one method of education results in
      statistically significant improvement in VTE prophylaxis administration, the investigators
      will cross over to deliver the superior education format to all nurses who originally were
      given the less effective method.

      BACKGROUND

        -  In an attempt to improve venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis adherence we carried
           out qualitative studies to obtain patients' viewpoints on how nurses should be educated
           about VTE prevention and to assess nurses' beliefs and perceptions about pharmacologic
           VTE prophylaxis

        -  We observed deficiencies in nurses' knowledge and misconceptions about VTE prophylaxis
           that likely lowers adherence to administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis doses

        -  As a part of our original Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)
           proposal, we planned to educate nurses to address the observed deficiencies and
           misconceptions and improve their ability to communicate effectively with patients

             -  Historically, nurse education has been done via a linear, PowerPoint-based
                platform with voice-over but with no interactive component (TRADITIONAL)

             -  A newer platform for nurse education became available for use and includes
                scenario-based teaching, ongoing assessment, and immediate remediation. Most
                importantly, it is a highly interactive product (CONTEMPORARY)

      STUDY DESIGN AND ANALYTIC PLAN

        -  Research hypotheses

             -  Primary: Nurse participants who receive either of these interventions will improve
                administration of prescribed VTE prophylaxis evidenced by a decrease in frequency
                of non-administered doses of VTE prophylaxis, compared with their frequency at
                baseline.

             -  Secondary: Nurse participants who receive the contemporary education format will
                have a larger decrease in frequency of missed doses of VTE prophylaxis compared
                with those who participate in the traditional education format.

        -  Study Design

             -  Cluster Randomized Trial 21 floors, block randomized by floor type (medicine
                [n=11] vs. surgery [n=10]) and (ICU [n=5] vs. non-ICU [n=16]) All nurses on each
                floor are assigned the same education type to mitigate issues related to
                contamination if nurses discuss the education with their colleagues

        -  Primary Outcome measure: Proportion of non-administered doses of pharmacological VTE
           prophylaxis (dose level)

        -  Secondary Outcome Measures:

             -  Proportion of doses documented as missed due to patient refusal (dose level)

             -  Proportion of patients with any VTE (patient level)

             -  Proportion of patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) (patient level)

             -  Proportion of patients with Pulmonary Embolism (PE) (patient level)

        -  Analytic methods

             -  Primary analyses - Intention-to-treat (includes all nurses assigned, whether or
                not they completed the education) Is there a difference between units allocated to
                either of the interventions comparing their outcome measure to their baseline
                measure? Is there a difference comparing those who received the contemporary
                education format vs. the traditional education format?

             -  Secondary analysis - Per protocol (includes only nurses who completed the
                education) Do nurses who receive education perform better (improved administration
                of prescribed VTE prophylaxis) than those who did not? Do nurses who received the
                education in the contemporary format perform better than those who received it in
                the traditional format
