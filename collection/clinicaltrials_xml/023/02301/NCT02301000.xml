      This is a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of a 10-day course of per oral
      Metronidazole versus a one-time rectal instillation of an anaerobically cultivated human
      intestinal microbiota for the treatment of a first occurrence of clostridium difficile
      infection (CDI). Recurrent CDI is common after standard antibiotic treatment. We hypothesize
      that the instillation of a healthy intestinal microbiota will be more effective in inducing
      a durable cure than Metronidazole for primary CDI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to one third of patients with clostridium difficile infection treated with antibiotics
      experience recurrent or relapsing symptoms within a few weeks. Even with subsequent
      antibiotic treatment, multiple recurrences/relapses are frequent. Fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be significantly more effective in curing recurrent
      CDI than repeated antibiotic treatment. In current guidelines, FMT is proposed as a
      treatment option after multiple recurrences/relapses of CDI. The rationale to reserve
      transplantation of donor feces for recurrent and difficult cases of CDI is a possible risk
      of pathogen transmittance and the cumbersome and costly process of finding a donor and
      screen for communicable disease. The effect of FMT for recurrent CDI, however, suggests that
      this therapy may be more effective than antibiotics in inducing a durable cure also for
      primary CDI.

      We aim to use an anaerobically cultivated human intestinal microbiota (ACHIM) that has been
      extensively tested for pathogens, from a donor screened for communicable diseases, to avoid
      the need for a case-by-case donor screening. The term Intestinal Microbiota Therapy (IMT)
      will be used to describe the ACHIM treatment.

      Patients with a first occurrence of CDI defined by diarrhea, as defined by the World Health
      Organization, and a positive stool test for Clostridium difficile toxin A or B will be
      randomized 1:1 to either a 10-day course of Metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d. or a rectal
      instillation of 60 ml ACHIM suspension.

      Patients will be contacted on day 4 by an unblinded study investigator and on days 35 and 70
      by a blinded study investigator to evaluate the treatment effect. In addition, the patients
      will register the frequency of bowel movements on days 1-4, 7, 14 and 21.

      In the case of clinical deterioration, appropriate measures will be undertaken according to
      current guidelines.

      A second instillation of ACHIM suspension will be considered on day 4 in the absence of
      clinical improvement.

      The primary endpoint is the rate of primary cure from CDI and no sign of relapse/recurrence
      within 70 days, or persistent diarrhea that could be explained by other causes with three
      consecutive negative stool tests for C. difficile toxin A or B.

      Treatment failure is defined as persistent diarrhea with a positive stool test for C.
      difficile toxin A or B.

      Relapsing or recurrent CDI is defined as diarrhea and a positive stool test for C. difficile
      toxin within 70 days of treatment initiation after an initial resolution of diarrhea.

      Preliminary sample size is estimated from a hypothesis of a primary cure rate without
      recurrence within 70 days of 75 % with Metronidazole vs. 87.5 % with IMT.

      An interim analysis is planned after inclusion of the first 40 patients to guide the final
      sample size estimation.

      Patients will be recruited at six hospitals in South-East Norway.
