  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the addition of a medication called
      epinephrine to spinal medications prolongs the duration of the anesthesia. The medication
      standardly used in spinal anesthesia is a local anesthetic (bupivacaine) and an opiate pain
      medication (morphine). These medications typically last about 2 hours. The investigators
      want to determine if adding epinephrine to the spinal medications prolongs the anesthetic
      without side effects. A longer duration of anesthesia may be useful in prolonged repeat
      cesarean section. Epinephrine is known to prolong the action of some local anesthetics, but
      the investigators want to specifically study combining it with the medications the
      investigators use regularly for cesarean section.

      You may qualify to take part in this research study because you are having a repeat cesarean
      section. Repeat cesarean sections sometimes last longer than 2 hours. The investigators want
      to determine if epinephrine will prolong the anesthetic.

      Spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine is a commonly used anesthetic in the obstetric
      population. It is most frequently carried out as a single shot intrathecal injection. This
      method can be utilized for both labor analgesia and surgical anesthesia for cesarean
      section. One of the concerns in using a single shot spinal injection for surgical anesthesia
      is the duration of adequate surgical conditions. This concern is especially relevant to
      repeat cesarean sections, as each subsequent procedure has the potential to be more complex
      than the prior and, therefore, prolonged. A reliable way to prolong surgical anesthesia
      provided by single shot spinal injection of bupivacaine could prove invaluable in the
      setting of repeat cesarean section. It has been well documented that adding epinephrine to
      intrathecal lidocaine will increase its duration1, but the evidence for augmenting the
      duration of anesthesia provided by adding epinephrine to bupivacaine is much more equivocal
      and less robust. This is a randomized control trial investigating whether or not adding
      epinephrine to a standard single intrathecal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine for repeat
      cesarean will prolong its duration. It will be investigated using women who are undergoing
      scheduled repeat cesarean section in whom neuraxial anesthesia is the appropriate primary
      anesthetic. The investigators will compare the onset, quality and duration of both sensory
      and motor components of the spinal block as well as the incidence of known side effects.
