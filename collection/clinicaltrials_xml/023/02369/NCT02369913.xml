      This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that humans shift to reliance on ketone
      bodies as a cardiac fuel source during the development of HF. The investigator also propose
      that this shift to ketone utilization can be detected by metabolomic profiling of blood.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine if the failing human heart exhibits increased extraction of
      blood-borne ketone bodies. Ketone bodies will be measured in coronary sinus, arterial, and
      central venous blood samples to determine AV differences. The HF group will be comprised of
      patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy with an implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator. The Control group will be compromised of patients without
      evidence of structural heart disease who are undergoing catheter ablation for
      supraventricular tachycardia.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine whether blood samples from humans with HF display metabolomic
      signatures indicative of increased myocardial ketone body utilization. Quantitative targeted
      metabolomics will be performed on the samples described in Aim 1 to determine if metabolite
      markers (e.g. C4-OH acylcarnitine, acetylcarnitine, succinate) found to be associated with
      increased myocardial ketone body oxidation in animal models are increased in the human HF
      group compared to the controls.

      After subjects agree to participate in this study and are scheduled to have cardiac
      resynchronization therapy, the research personnel will take 1 teaspoon of blood before and
      after the scheduled cardiac procedure for comparison.

      Once subjects agree to participate in this study and are scheduled to have a catheter
      ablation procedure, research personnel will take 1 teaspoon of blood during the scheduled
      cardiac procedure.

      These samples will be taken from catheters already placed during the scheduled cardiac
      procedure.

      Blood will be sent to a lab at the Sanford-Burnham Metabolomics Core Facility in Orlando,
      Florida for analysis.
