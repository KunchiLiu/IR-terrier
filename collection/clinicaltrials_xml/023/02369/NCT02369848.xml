  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shockwave Medical, Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, clinical
      study designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Shockwave Lithoplasty™ System
      in subjects with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries with 3.50mm to 7.0mm
      reference vessel diameter at the target site. The Shockwave Lithoplasty™ System is indicated
      to generate sonic shockwave energy within the target treatment site and disrupt calcium
      within the lesion to allow for subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low
      balloon pressure. Up to sixty (60) subjects will be enrolled and treated with Lithoplasty to
      yield thirty (51) evaluable subjects complete the study assuming a 15% lost to follow-up
      rate.

      Shockwave Medical, Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, clinical
      study designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Shockwave Lithoplasty™ System
      in subjects with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries with 3.50mm to 7.0mm
      reference vessel diameter at the target site. The Shockwave Lithoplasty™ System is indicated
      for lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilation of calcified, stenotic peripheral
      arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous therapy. Up to sixty (60) subjects
      will be enrolled at up to 8 centers in Europe and New Zealand to yield at least 51 evaluable
      subjects (assuming a lost-to-follow up rate of 15%).

      Subjects will be evaluated at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after
      enrollment/index procedure.

      Primary endpoints include safety and efficacy. Safety is a composite of new-onset Major
      Adverse Events through 30 days. Efficacy is target lesion patency at 12 months by duplex
      ultrasound defined as freedom from ≥50% restenosis.
