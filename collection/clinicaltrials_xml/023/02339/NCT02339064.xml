  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, safety and efficacy study of continuous infusion
      apomorphine in subjects with advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) who are unable to achieve
      adequate control despite optimized noninvasive therapy.

    <textblock>
      This Phase 3, multi center, open-label study will assess the long-term safety of continuous
      infusion apomorphine in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are unable to achieve
      adequate control despite optimized noninvasive therapy. Further, this study will assess the
      clinical effectiveness of continuous infusion apomorphine in reducing &quot;off&quot; time in advanced
      Parkinson's disease patients and to assess the clinical effectiveness of continuous infusion
      apomorphine in improving &quot;on&quot; time without troublesome dyskinesias.
