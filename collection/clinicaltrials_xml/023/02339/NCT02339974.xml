  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the short term safety (&lt;30 days) and mid and long
      term efficacy (6 months and &gt;1-year) of the heterotopic implantation of the Edwards-Sapien
      XT valve in the inferior vena cava for the treatment of severe tricuspid regurgitation in
      patients who are inoperable or at a very high surgical risk for tricuspid valve replacement.

      This is a prospective single center non-blinded (open label), non-randomized safety and
      feasibility study enrolling patients who have symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation and
      whom are at extremely high risk for standard tricuspid valve surgery. These patients will
      undergo inferior vena cava (IVC) stenting with an Edwards-Sapien Transcatheter valve for
      amelioration of their symptoms. In those patients with favorable anatomic substrate,
      pre-stenting will be performed at the right atrial (RA) IVC junction to provide a stable
      scaffold for the transcatheter valve implant

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be at least 22 years old.

          2. The patient must have severe, symptomatic (ACC/AHA Stage D symptoms) tricuspid
             regurgitation as assessed by 2D echocardiogram, and or evidenced by right heart
             catheterization of ventricular v-wave transmission into the inferior vena cava, with
             evidence of peripheral and central venous congestion. TR should be functional in
             nature, without anatomical abnormalities of the tricuspid valve leaflets themselves.

          3. The patient must be evaluated by a &quot;heart team&quot; of physicians including an
             interventional cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, and heart failure specialist and
             presented for review at a multi-disciplinary conference. By consensus, the heart team
             must agree (and verify in the case review process) that valve implantation will
             likely benefit the patient.

          4. The heart team agrees that medical factors preclude operation, based on a conclusion
             that the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity exceeds the
             probability of meaningful improvement. Specifically the probability of death or
             serious, irreversible morbidity is ≥ 50%. Also, other factors which may increase the
             patients perceived surgical risk for inclusion in the trial will be clearly
             delineated if they are present. The surgeons' consultation notes shall specify the
             medical or anatomic factors leading to that conclusion. At least one of the cardiac
             surgeon assessors must have interviewed and examined the patient.

          5. The study patient agrees to comply with all required post-procedure follow-up visits
             including annual visits through 5 years and analysis close date visits, which will be
             conducted as a phone follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Heart Team assessment of operability (the heart team considers the patient to be a
             good surgical candidate).

          2. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction ≤ 1 month (30 days) before the intended
             treatment [defined as: Q wave MI, or non-Q wave MI with total CK elevation of CK-MB ≥
             twice normal in the presence of MB elevation and/or troponin level elevation (WHO
             definition)].

          3. Untreated, severe, left sided valvular heart disease including mitral regurgitation
             or stenosis, and aortic regurgitation or stenosis.

          4. Mean pulmonary artery pressures ≥40mmHG and PVR &gt;4 woods units as assessed by right
             heart catheterization.

          5. Any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure resulting in a permanent implant that is
             performed within 30 days of the index procedure. Implantation of a permanent
             pacemaker is excluded.

          6. Patients with planned concomitant surgical or transcatheter ablation for Atrial
             Fibrillation.

          7. Leukopenia (WBC &lt; 3000 cell/mL), acute anemia (Hgb &lt; 9 g/dL), Thrombocytopenia (Plt &lt;
             50,000 cell/mL).

          8. Hemodynamic or respiratory instability requiring inotropic support, mechanical
             ventilation or mechanical heart assistance within 30 days of screening evaluation.

          9. Need for emergency surgery for any reason.

         10. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%.

         11. Echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation.

         12. Active upper GI bleeding within 3 months (90 days) prior to procedure.

         13. A known contraindication or hypersensitivity to all anticoagulation regimens, or
             inability to be anticoagulated for the study procedure.

         14. Recent CVA clinically confirmed (by neurologist) or neuroimaging confirmed stroke or
             transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months (180 days) of the procedure.

         15. Estimated life expectancy &lt; 1 year

         16. Expectation that patient will not improve despite treatment of tricuspid
             regurgitation

         17. Currently participating in another investigational cardiac device study. Note: Trials
             requiring extended follow-up for products that were investigational, but have since
             become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials.

        18 .Active bacterial endocarditis within 6 months (180 days) of procedure. 19. Patients
        with TR secondary to trauma of the tricuspid valve, a history of tricuspid valve
        endocarditis or carcinoid syndrome.

        20. Patients with signs or symptoms of SVC syndrome, or hepatic cirrhosis not felt due to
        passive congestion from TR.
