    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the fixed combination (BID) [Brinzolamide 10 mg/mL /
      Brimonidine 2 mg/mL eyes drops, suspension] to the unfixed combination (BID) [Brinzolamide
      10 mg/mL eye drops, suspension plus Brimonidine 2 mg/mL eyes drops, solution] with respect
      to intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy. This study will take place in China,
      Taiwan, and Russia.

      This study is divided into 2 phases conducted in sequence for a total of 6 visits: Phase I
      (Screening/Eligibility) which includes a Screening Visit, followed by 2 Eligibility Visits
      (E1 and E2) and Phase II (Treatment/Follow-up) which includes 3 visits at Week 2, Week 6,
      and Month 3. Following washout of any IOP-lowering medication, subjects who meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria at both Eligibility visits and had IOP measurements within the
      specified range during this period will be randomized to Phase II.

    <description>Diurnal IOP (mean of the three timepoints measured: 9 AM, +2 Hrs and +7Hrs), is measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. One eye from each subject will be chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye will be used for analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension insufficiently controlled on
             monotherapy or currently on multiple IOP-lowering medications;

          -  Mean IOP measurements within guidelines specified in the protocol. Must not be &gt; 36
             mmHg at any time point;

          -  Able to understand and sign an informed consent form;

          -  Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI);

          -  Concurrent use of glucocorticoids administered by any route;

             derivatives, or to any component of the study medications;

          -  Less than 30 days stable dosing regimen before the Screening Visit of any medications
             (excluding IOP-lowering treatments) or substances administered by any route and used
             on a chronic basis that may affect IOP, including but not limited to β-adrenergic

          -  Use of any additional topical or systemic ocular hypotensive medication during the
