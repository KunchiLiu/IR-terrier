  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, as a post-marketing commitment to the Food and Drug Administration, is designed
      to detect the effect of raxibacumab on anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) immunogenicity in a
      healthy volunteer population. This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, two arm
      study to compare the immunogenicity of AVA at 4 weeks after the first AVA dose, when AVA is
      administered alone or concomitantly with raxibacumab. The study is planned to enroll
      approximately 30 to 534 subjects in up to 3 cohorts. The total duration of the study will be
      approximately 26 weeks. The dates reflect cohort 1.

             dose of study medication until completion of the follow-up visit, unless in the
