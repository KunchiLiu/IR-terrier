      The goal of this study is to determine whether Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter or
      Centrally Inserted Venous Catheters have lower complication rates in the Neuroscience
      Intensive Care Unit. After admission to the Neuroscience ICU and if they require central
      access, patients will be randomized to receive a PICC or CVC and complications (such as
      pneumothorax, deep venous thrombosis, infection, etc.) will be tracked and compared between
      the two interventions.
