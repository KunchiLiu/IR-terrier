        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infected children weighing ≥ 17 kg at the screening visit

          -  Parents or guardians, and children where appropriate, willing and able to give
             informed consent and to adhere to the protocol

          -  Children must have all HIV-1 RNA viral load &lt;50c/mL for at least 12 months with a
             minimum of two separate results before screening.

          -  Children on a 3-drug PI/r or NNRTI containing regimen for at least 6 months.

          -  Children/parents/guardians prepared to switch if randomised to elvitegravir +
             darunavir/ritonavir arm

          -  Children and parents prepared to restart the current ART regimen after simplification
             if viral load restart criteria are met (see Section 5.5)

          -  For children aged 6-12 either: children and caregivers are willing to participate in
             the lead-in PK study if the child is aged 6-12 and the PK study is still enrolling
             children in their weight band* OR Data from the lead-in PK study have been analysed
             and children aged 6-12 can be enrolled directly into the main study * only children
             randomised to Arm 1 will take part

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving or requiring agents with interactions with darunavir, RTV, or EVG

          -  Evidence of resistance to DRV or integrase inhibitors (for participants in clinical
             sites where resistance testing is standard of care)

          -  Previous exposure to integrase inhibitors for more than 2 weeks

          -  History of previous encephalopathy

          -  Intercurrent illness (randomisation can take place after the illness resolves)

          -  Creatinine, AST or ALT of grade 3 or above at screening.

          -  Diagnosis of tuberculosis and on anti-tuberculosis treatment (children can be
             enrolled after successful tuberculosis treatment)

          -  Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C co-infection

          -  Pregnancy or risk of pregnancy in girls of child-bearing potential unless committed
             to taking effective contraception
