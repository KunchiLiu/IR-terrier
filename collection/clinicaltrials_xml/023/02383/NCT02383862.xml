  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of providing PROMIS Profile
      Scale scores (e.g., sleep, pain, anxiety, depression, energy/fatigue) to physicians on
      patients' symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SPADE symptoms (sleep, pain, anxiety, depression, and energy/fatigue) are the most
      common yet undertreated symptoms in clinical practice. Using the PROMIS Profile Scales as a
      measure of SPADE symptoms, this study will determine the effectiveness of providing patient
      symptom scores to clinicians, identify barriers and facilitators to the clinical use of such
      scores, and evaluate the psychometric properties of the PROMIS Profile Scales in a primary
      care population.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in PROMIS Composite Score at 3-Month Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>PROMIS Composite Scores of the 5 SPADE symptoms (sleep, pain, anxiety, depression, and energy/fatigue) will be computed at baseline and at 3 month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS symptom measures will be administered at baseline and at 3 month follow-up. To assess the effects of feedback on sleep, pain, anxiety, depression and energy/fatigue, group differences in the change in PROMIS composite scores from baseline to 3 month follow up will be calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Patients' satisfaction with treatment will be assessed at 3 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>At 3-month follow-up, treatment satisfaction will be assessed for any symptom that was at a moderate level (PROMIS T-score greater than or equal to 55) at baseline using a 3-item symptom specific treatment satisfaction scale.</description>
