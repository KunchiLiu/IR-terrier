      This Phase II study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib in
      subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic, relapsed and/or refractory
      tumors that carry HRAS mutations and for whom there is no curative therapy available.
      Subject with information available on tumor HRAS status previously generated are eligible.
      All subjects must consent to provide at least 10 tumor slides from a prior diagnostic biopsy
      for a retrospective testing of RAS gene status at a central facility.

      Subjects will be enrolled into two nonrandomized cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: Malignant thyroid tumors with HRAS mutations.

        -  Cohort 2: Squamous Head and Neck Cancer with HRAS mutations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of thyroid cancer (cohort 1) or
