    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct a small, self-contained project to test the hypothesis
      that tDCS will augment SOP cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) in older HIV+ adults. The
      investigators will randomly assign 60 HIV+ older adults (i.e., â‰¥ 50 years old) to 10-hours
      in either a SOP CRT + sham tDCS condition (n=30) or SOP CRT + active tDCS condition (n=30)
      and examine neurocognitive functioning at baseline and 6 weeks post-intervention. Hypothesis
      1: The SOP CRT + active tDCS condition will show larger proximal (i.e., SOP) gains than the
      SOP CRT + sham tDCS condition. Hypothesis 2: The active tDCS condition will demonstrate
      generalization to secondary neurocognitive domains compared to the sham tDCS condition.

    <description>Subjects in the sham arm will be administered sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (i.e., tDCS will be administered for 30 seconds and then will automatically turn off). Sham group will have identical intervention of engagement in 10 1-hour computerized cognitive remediation therapy sessions during sham tDCS as with the active tDCS condition.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects in the active arm will be administered active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (i.e., 2.0 mA tDCS will be administered for 20 minutes and then will automatically turn off). Active group will have identical intervention engagement in 10 1-hour computerized cognitive remediation therapy sessions during active tDCS as with the sham tDCS condition.</description>

    <description>tDCS is a low level electrical stimulation that will be applied to F10. The sham group will receive 2 mA (milliamps) for 30 seconds, while the experimental group will receive 2 mA for 20 minutes. Both groups will have 10, 1 hour sessions of playing cognitive remediation games, while receiving the respective level of tDCS for sham vs experimental conditions.</description>
