      The current pilot study aims to close the existing gap in our knowledge about effective
      psychosocial treatments for Latino families by providing preliminary data regarding the
      acceptability and efficacy of a culturally-modified ADHD treatment and possible moderators
      that will support a future R01. Specifically, the current pilot study is the first step in a
      larger program of research aimed at definitively determining if culturally-modified ADHD
      treatment outperforms standard treatment when examining engagement and acceptability
      outcomes, as well as symptomatology and parental functioning, and if so, which treatment
      modifications are necessary and for whom. The following study aims will be examined.

        1. Aim 1 is to explore if the culturally-modified treatment results in better engagement
           and acceptability outcomes (i.e., parental attendance, retention, engagement, and
           satisfaction) than standard treatment and to determine the strength of these effects.

        2. Aim 2 is to explore if the culturally-modified treatment results in improvements in
           ADHD symptomatology, as well as parental functioning (i.e., parenting stress and
           efficacy), to explore if the modified treatment results in similar or greater
           improvements than standard treatment, and to determine the strength of these effects.

        3. Aim 3 is to explore possible moderators (i.e., socioeconomic status (SES) and
           behavioral and cognitive acculturation) that may explain the relationship between
           treatment type (i.e., standard versus culturally-modified) and outcomes and to
           determine the strength of these interactions.
