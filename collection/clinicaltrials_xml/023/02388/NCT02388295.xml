        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, age 30-80 years, inclusive, at screen.

          2. Meet criteria for diagnosis of probable or possible MSA according to the consensus
             criteria (Gilman et al. 2008 ).

          3. &quot;High-affinity binder&quot; or &quot;mixed-affinity binder&quot; for TSPO, as confirmed by
             prospective genotyping of TSPO polymorphism during screen.

          4. Subjects must understand the nature of the study and must provide signed and dated
             written informed consent in accordance with local regulations before the conduct of
             any study-related procedures. The informed consent should reflect the protocol
             stipulations concerning the use of contraception.

          5. Medical treatment of MSA and co-morbid medical conditions must be stable for at least
             30 days prior to screen and between screen and baseline.

          7. Able and willing to participate in all scheduled evaluations, abide by all study
             restrictions, and complete all required tests and procedures.

          8. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject must be considered likely to comply

             measurements) or a family history of long-QT syndrome.

         19. Uncontrolled hypertension

         20. History or presence of diabetes, unless glucose levels have been well controlled and

             screen and baseline (Day -1).

         21. History of cancer within the last 5 years, with the exception of nonmetastatic basal
             cell carcinoma of the skin.

         22. Any clinically important abnormality, as determined by the investigator, on physical
             examination or vital signs, ECG, or clinical laboratory test results other than
             abnormality due to a stable, well-controlled medical condition; or any abnormality
             that could be detrimental to the subject or could compromise the study.

         23. Use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, Use of potent inducers of CYP3A4 and/or Use of
