    <textblock>
      This is a comparative study of vonoprazan (TAK-438) (10 mg or 20 mg) in participants in whom
      endoscopic healing of erosive esophagitis has been confirmed with vonoprazan or adequate
      treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), to demonstrate the non-inferiority of
      vonoprazan to lansoprazole in their maintenance treatment (6 months or 24 weeks) as well as
      to determine the clinically recommended dose for vonoprazan for maintenance therapy in
      erosive esophagitis.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vonoprazan. Vonoprazan is being tested as a
      maintenance treatment for people with healed erosive esophagitis (EE). This study will look
      at participants in whom endoscopic healing of erosive esophagitis has been confirmed with
      vonoprazan or adequate treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), to demonstrate the
      non-inferiority of vonoprazan to Lansoprazole in their maintenance treatment (6 months or 24
      weeks) as well as to determine the clinically recommended dose for vonoprazan for
      maintenance therapy in erosive esophagitis.

      The study will enroll approximately 693 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groupsâ€”which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  TAK-438 10 mg

        -  TAK-438 20 mg

        -  Lansoprazole 15 mg

      Participants with ongoing erosive esophagitis (EE) will receive lansoprazole 30 mg once
      daily for 4 or 8 weeks (the Healing phase) until healing of EE is confirmed by endoscopy
      performed at either Week -4 and/or Day 1 before eligible for randomization to maintenance
      phase. In Maintenance phase, participants with confirming EE healing will be asked to take 2
      tablets and a capsule at the same time each morning after breakfast throughout the study.
      All participants will be asked to record daytime and nighttime (during sleep) subjective
      symptoms in a diary on a daily basis.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 8 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 7-14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
