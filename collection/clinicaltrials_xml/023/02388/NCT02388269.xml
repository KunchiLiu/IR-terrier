      This study, in subjects with FGIDs, is a , randomized, sham-controlled, single-centre pilot
      investigation designed to compare two parallel groups, gammaCore®-G (active treatment) and a
      sham, (inactive) treatment. The study period will begin with a two-week run-in period,
      followed by a four week comparative period when the subjects will randomized (1:1) to either
      active treatment or sham (inactive) treatment. The comparative period will be followed by an
      open label four week period, where the subjects in the sham treatment group will switch in
      treatment assignment to receive active treatment and the active group will continue to
      receive an active treatment.

    <description>The user/operator applies the gammaCore®-G device to the skin on the right side and left side of the neck. The 2 stimulations should be performed on the same side of the neck before stimulating the other side. This is also applies with the doses increase in the open label phase. The user applies conductive gel to the stimulation surfaces to maintain an uninterrupted conductive path from the stimulation surfaces to the skin.
The device is capable of delivering multiple patient treatments (doses). Each dose consists of 90 seconds of stimulation; for each dose, the device is active for 120 seconds before automatically stopping stimulation.The extra 30 seconds allows .</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The sham device is a hand-held portable device that appears identical to the gammaCore®-G, in look, weight, visual and audible feedback, user application and control. It passes a low frequency (0.1 Hz) biphasic DC signal into the tissue, which can be felt as a tingling sensation but does not stimulate the vagus nerve or cause muscle contraction. Similar to the active device, the sensation becomes more pronounced as the amplitude is increased, until it is uncomfortable, at which point the amplitude is decreased slightly until tolerable.
Like the active device, the sham device is a multi-use device capable programmed to deliver up to 150, 90-second &quot;treatments&quot; with a 30-second margin for set-up and operator adjustment of the &quot;stimulation intensity&quot;.</description>

    <description>The gammaCore®-G device is a reusable, hand-held, portable device consisting of two 3.0 VDC batteries (not replaceable or user serviceable), signal generating and amplifying electronics, and two buttons for operator control of the signal amplitude. The device provides visible (light display) and audible feedback on device and stimulation status</description>
