    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, as documented by a rapid HIV test or any FDA-approved HIV-1 Enzyme
             or Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit and confirmed by Western blot at
             any time prior to study entry or HIV antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA, or second antibody
             test by a method other than rapid HIV and E/CIA. Alternatively, if a rapid HIV test
             or any FDA-approved HIV-1 Enzyme or Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit is
             not available, two HIV-1 RNA values ≥ 2000 copies/mL at least 24 hours apart
             performed by any laboratory that has CLIA certification, or its equivalent, may be
             used to document infection.

          -  On a stable antiretroviral medication (no changes to treatment within 4 weeks of
             screening visit) and be willing to continue on current antiretroviral therapy for the
             duration of the study except for the duration of the 16 week analytical treatment
             interruption. NOTE: Subject's ART regimen must be in accordance with the Department
             of Health and Human Services Document &quot;Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral
             Agents in HIV-1 Infected Adults and Adolescents.&quot;

          -  CD4+ T cell count of ≥450 cells/mm3 at screen; and a documented CD4 nadir of not
             lower than 200 cells/mm3.

          -  HIV-1 RNA undetectable by ultrasensitive assay copies/ml obtained at study screening
             visit or within 60 days prior to study screening visit performed with an
             ultrasensitive HIV-1 PCR assay.

          -  All subjects must have received at least 18 months of therapy, and have had
             undetectable viral loads by ultrasensitive assay since month 6 of therapy. Subjects
             who had intermittent isolated episodes of detectable low-level viremia (detectable
             but &lt; 500 copies RNA/mL; blips) will remain eligible.

          -  Adequate venous access and no other contraindications for leukapheresis.

          -  Laboratory values obtained at screen:

               1. Hemoglobin: ≥ 10.0 (males); ≥ 9.5 (females) g/dL

               2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC): ≥ 1000/mm3

               3. Platelet count: ≥ 100,000/mm3

               4. Serum creatinine: ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (133μ mol/L)

               5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT): ≤ 2.5 times
                  the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Subjects must be willing to comply with study-mandated evaluations; including not
             changing their antiretroviral regimen (unless medically indicated) for 2 months in
             step 2 or until undergoing the analytical treatment interruption.

          -  Be male or female, 18 years of age and older.

          -  Ability and willingness of subject to provide informed consent.

          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Score of 70 or higher.

          -  Have no polymorphisms in the CCR5 ZFN target region as determined by Cel I snp assay
             at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection (as further defined in section
             6.3.4 and 6.3.8 of this protocol)

          -  Current or prior AIDS diagnosis.

          -  History of cancer or malignancy, with the exception of successfully treated basal
             cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

          -  History or any features on physical examination indicative of active or unstable
             cardiac disease or hemodynamic instability. NOTE: subjects with a history of cardiac
             disease may participate with a physician's approval.

          -  History or any features on physical examination indicative of a bleeding diathesis.

          -  Have been previously treated with any HIV experimental vaccine within 6 months prior
             to screening, or any previous gene therapy using an integrating vector. Note:
             Subjects treated with placebo in an HIV vaccine study will not be excluded if
             documentation that they received placebo is provided.

          -  Use of chronic systemic corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, or immunomodulating agents
             (e.g., interleukin-2, interferon-alpha or gamma, granulocyte colony stimulating
             factors, etc.) within 30 days prior to study screening visit. NOTE: Recent or current
             use of inhaled steroids is not exclusionary. If subjects are prescribed a brief
             course of oral corticosteroids, the use should be limited to less than 7 days. Use of
             steroids before apheresis and immune assessment blood draws should be discouraged as
             it will affect white blood cell function.

          -  Breast-feeding, pregnant, or unwilling to use acceptable methods of birth control.

          -  Use of aspirin, dyprydamole, warfarin or any other medication that is likely to
             affect platelet function or other aspects of blood coagulation during the 2-week
             period prior to leukapheresis.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          -  Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days
             prior to study screening visit.

          -  Asymptomatic baseline serum chemistry elevations in LFTs, bilirubin, lipase and serum
             creatinine due to HAART medication are not exclusionary, when in the opinion of the
             investigator, the abnormalities are not attributable to intrinsic hepatorenal
             disease. Such baseline elevations must be due to HAART.

          -  Receipt of vaccination within 30 days prior to study screening visit. NOTE: It is
             recommended that subjects enrolling into this study should have completed their
             routine vaccinations (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, and tetanus diphtheria
             booster) at least 30 days prior to screening for the study.

          -  Have an allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum albumin,
             DMSO and Dextran 40).

          -  CXCR4-tropic or R5/X4 dual-tropic HIV identified at screening using DNA tropism
             assay.
