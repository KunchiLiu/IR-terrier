  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose conducting a pilot study to identify 6 worksites (2 India, 2 Sri
      Lanka, 2 Bangladesh) explore barriers to optimum cardiovascular disease(CVD) care at these
      worksites, quantify risk factor level in worksite populations and identify and train peer
      mentors to deliver an educational intervention to improve life style and enhance medication
      adherence among those at moderate to high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

      Eligibility Criteria -

      All employees aged above 35 years at selected workplaces.

      Study design - Mixed methods methods Phase 1 - Qualitative study; Phase 2 - Quantitative -
      Single group, non-randomized before-after comparison study + KAP survey

      Sample size - Approximately 3000 participants.

      The study entails the following steps -

      Step 1 - An evaluation for knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to
      cardiovascular health/ disease at worksites.

      Step 2 - A qualitative study for barriers and facilitators of behaviors associated with
      optimal cardiovascular health

      Step 3 - Baseline assessment of cardiovascular risk using a non-lab based risk assessment
      score

      Step 4 - Piloting a trained peer mentored educational/ intensive follow-up intervention for
      3 month with a re-assessment at 3 months.

    <description>Employees above the age of 35 years will be rise stratified into moderate or high risk of developing cardiovascular disease using a simple non-lab based risk scoring system, they will be invited to participate in the pilot intervention study. This is a single arm before-after study.subject education will focus on life style medication and adherence to medication (if applicable).importantly the peer mentor will try to identify barriers to adopting a healthy lifestyle(tobacco, physical acitivity, diet, alcohol and strees) and adherence to cardiovascular disease prevention medication. peer mentors will be trained to interpret blood glucose and lipids, recognize abnormal valves, provide lifestyle counseling and refer to treating physician when appropriate.</description>
