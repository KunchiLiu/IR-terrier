    <textblock>
      This is an interventional pilot study of 40 burn inpatients. Specific aims of the proposed
      pilot study are to use bedside blood analysis with rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in
      severe burn patients to provide preliminary information on the nature of coagulation
      abnormalities and compare subject ROTEM coagulation profiles within 24 hours of burn injury
      (day 1) and on days 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 after burn injury.

      Specific aims of this pilot study are to use bedside blood analysis with ROTEM in severe
      burn patients to provide preliminary information on the nature of coagulation abnormalities
      and to compare subject ROTEM coagulation profiles within 24 hours of burn injury (day 1) and
      on days 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 after burn injury. Investigators hypothesize that ROTEM
      analysis will detect a pattern of impaired coagulation in severely burned patients.

      ROTEM analysis:

      A blood sample and reagents are placed into a small cup. A pin suspended from a wire is
      immersed into the sample. The pin rotates back and forth at a fixed angle. The movement of
      the pin is optically monitored and converted into a real time measurement that is
      represented graphically. Prior to clot formation, pin rotation is unhindered and is
      graphically represented as a straight line. As the subject's blood sample starts to clot,
      strands of clot form between the pin and the cup wall, restricting the movement of the pin
      depending on the strength of the clot. Graphically, this is represented as a symmetrical
      widening of the curve. Blood will be obtained for ROTEM/ fibrinogen levels from each subject
      seven times during their hospital admission: once within 24 hours of burn injury (day 1),
      and on days 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21. For each sample, 5.4 mL of whole blood will be collected
      into 2 citrated tubes (2.7 mL in each tube). For all subjects, both pediatric and adult,
      blood will be collected via an indwelling catheter (arterial or central line). One 2.7 ml
      tube will be used for ROTEM analysis. The amount of blood is in accordance with the
      acceptable limit of ROTEM analysis. ROTEM testing will be performed according to the
      manufacturer's instructions using test kit reagents. Members of the clinical research team
      who have been trained and certified to use the ROTEM device will perform the appropriate
      ROTEM tests. The second 2.7 mL citrated tube will be used to measure fibrinogen level, using
      the automated central laboratory device in hospital.

      In this interventional study, the ROTEM data will be blinded to the treating Burn ICU
      physicians and will have no effect on standard perioperative and ICU treatment. The ROTEM
      machine will be located in a designated spot outside of the ICU, out of view of the treating
      clinicians. Thus, volume replacement, thrombosis prophylaxis, and other management
      (including blood product transfusions) will be performed according to existing protocols.

      Demographic information will be de-identified, but will include demographics (age, sex) and
      each subject's medical and surgical history, burn injury type (thermal, chemical,
      electrical, inhalational, plus/minus additional injury - i.e. Trauma/TBI, etc) and percent
      Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) as diagrammed by the Burn ICU on admission, medications
      (specifically, form of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis as prescribed by ICU physicians
      during the study period), weight, vital signs, dates of surgical intervention (bedside
      escharotomies and OR procedures), dates and types of blood product administration, fluid
      balance per day, number of days intubated, number of ICU days, hospital LOS, mortality, and
      ISS. Laboratory values: (on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21) will include fibrinogen, PT,
      INR, aPTT, and CBC when available as standard of care.
