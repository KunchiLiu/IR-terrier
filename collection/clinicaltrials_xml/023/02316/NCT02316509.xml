  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-finding study of SRN-927 administered orally on a continuous
      daily dosing regimen with a PK lead-in period (dose escalation period only). The incidence
      of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated from Day -7 through the first cycle (28
      days) of treatment (35 days total). Depending on safety and tolerability, patients will be
      assigned sequentially to escalating doses of SRN-927 using standard 3+3 design. All patients
      will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal of
      consent.
