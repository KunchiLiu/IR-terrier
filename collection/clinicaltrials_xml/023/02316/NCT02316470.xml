      Phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centric study including 4
      parallel study groups.

      500 Subjects (thereof, 250 aged 50 - 64 years and 250 aged 65 years and older) will be
      randomized in a (3:3:3:1) ratio to receive either VLA84 75 µg w/o (without) Alum, VLA84 200
      µg w/o Alum, VLA84 200 µg w/ (with) Alum (150 subjects each), or placebo (50 subjects), as
      i.m. (intramuscular) vaccinations into alternating arms, on Days 0, 7 and 28

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, observer-blind Phase 2 study which aims to confirm the
      optimal dose and formulation of VLA84 in healthy adults aged ≥ 50 years of age. The study
      will be enrolled in two age strata, subjects aged 50 - 64 years and subjects aged 65 years
      and older, in a 1:1 ratio.

      500 subjects (thereof, 250 aged 50 - 64 years and 250 aged 65 years and older) will be
      randomized in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to receive either VLA84 75 µg w/o Alum, VLA84 200 µg w/o Alum,
      VLA84 200 µg w/ Alum (150 subjects each), or placebo (50 subjects). Vaccinations consist of
      two i.m. injections administered in close proximity to each other in the deltoid region at
      Day 0, 7 and 28, starting with the non-dominant arm and alternating arms between the
      vaccination days.

      The study will investigate the immunogenicity and safety of VLA84 up to six months after the
      last vaccination, i.e. 210 days per subject. The study includes eight outpatient visits on
      days 0, 7, 14, 28, 35, 56, 120 and 210. Serum will be collected to assess humoral immunity
      at days 0, 7, 14, 28, 35, 56, 120 and 210.

      The study is OBSERVER blind. This means only pre-defined study staff will be unblinded,
      e.g., staff responsible for IMP accountability, preparation and administration, monitor
      responsible IMP accountability, or safety staff in case of safety reasons. All other persons
      involved in study conduct will remain blinded.

             episode

          -  Previous vaccination against Clostridium difficile with any (investigational) vaccine
             or receipt of (investigational) monoclonal antibodies against Clostridium difficile
             toxins

          -  Use of any other investigational or non-registered medicinal product within 30 days
             prior to VLA84 vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 0) and throughout the entire study period.

          -  Active or passive vaccination four weeks before first vaccination at Visit 1 and
             during the entire study period, except for influenza (seasonal or pandemic) and

             to VLA84 vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 0) and during the study until Visit 5 (Day 35).
             For corticosteroids this means prednisone or equivalent ≥ 0.05 mg/kg/day; topical and
             inhaled steroids are allowed. Periodic steroid injections, e.g., intra-articular, are
             not allowed within 30 days prior to first VLA84 vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 0) and
             until Visit 5 (Day 35)

          -  History of autoimmune disease, including Type I Diabetes mellitus. Subjects with
             vitiligo or thyroid disease taking thyroid hormone replacement are not excluded

          -  Any malignancy in the past 5 years. If treatment for cancer was successfully
