      The main objective is to study the epigenetic contribution to the pathophysiology of
      diabetic nephropathy in Qatari population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common vascular complication of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) that is
      associated with increased mortality and poor quality of life.In industrialized countries, DN
      ranges first among other etiologies of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).Diabetes in Qatar is a
      serious health issue for the Qatari population since approximately 1/5 of the population has
      T2D, which is 2-3 times higher than the world average. As observed in other Gulf cooperation
      council (GCC) countries, obesity and sedentary lifestyle are cornerstones in the development
      of T2D. Additionally, consanguineous marriages in Qatar contribute to this high prevalence.
      As a consequence, DN has an enormous burden in terms of management, treatment and especially
      in renal replacement therapy (RRT) in ESRD in Qatari Population.DN is a glomerular disease
      defined by increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE), hypertension and decline in the
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR), all induced by chronic hyperglycemia. However, there are
      other contributing factors such as genetic predisposition, systemic and intra-renal
      hemodynamic disturbances, all leading to glomerulosclerosis. All of the known pathways do
      not explain the complex pathophysiology behind DN. Even different variants of genes
      described in major GWAS studies have little impact in terms of risk prevention or prognosis
      of DN. Over the last decade, epigenetics have initiated a new era in Genetic Medicine
      capable of giving a different approach to human disease.
