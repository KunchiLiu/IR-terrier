    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills Therapy (CBCST) is a commonly utilized, evidence-based
      psychosocial therapy (talk therapy) for alcohol dependence. By identifying the neural
      mechanisms through which CBCST changes drinking behavior, it may be possible to improve its
      efficacy. CBCST promotes abstinence by teaching &quot;coping skills&quot; for managing alcohol-related
      thoughts and emotions. In this pilot study, the investigators examine the neural systems
      that play a role in the learning of coping skills through CBCST, specifically focusing on
      the role of emotion regulation systems.

      The study combines 1) a 12-week clinical trial of CBCST in currently drinking alcohol
      dependent patients (target N=25) who are seeking treatment to reduce their drinking with 2)
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments that probe neural activity related
      to the utilization of copings skills taught in CBCST. The fMRI studies will be performed
      both before and after treatment with CBCST, with the goal of determining 1) the pattern of
      neural activity that is related to coping skills utilization prior to undergoing CBCST, with
      particular focus on neural systems known to play a role in emotion regulation; 2) how CBCST
      changes this pattern of neural activity; and 3) how these changes in neural activity predict
      changes in alcohol use during CBCST.
