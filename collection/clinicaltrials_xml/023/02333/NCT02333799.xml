    <description>Bacteriologic failure: During the treatment period, failure to attain culture conversion to negative.
Bacteriologic relapse: During the follow-up period, failure to maintain culture conversion to negative status in culture, with culture conversion to positive status with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.) strain that is genetically identical to the infecting strain at baseline.
