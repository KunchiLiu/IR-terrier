    <textblock>
      This is a study assessing safety and efficacy of current national guidelines for the
      treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Bangladesh as well as to assess the G6PD status among
      the enrolled patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The national guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Bangladesh currently
      recommend a standard dose of artemether-lumefantrine followed by a single dose of primaquine
      for P. falciparum malaria and a three day course of chloroquine followed by 14 days of
      primaquine for vivax malaria.Currently the national treatment guidelines do not include any
      testing for G6PD deficiency before treatment with primaquine. In order to guarantee safe and
      efficacious treatment for all patients diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria in Bangladesh,
      it is essential to monitor the effectiveness and safety of the recommended treatment
      guidelines. This trial therefore evaluates the local efficacy and safety of the current
      first line treatment and assesses the G6PD status of the enrolled patients.

      Patients with uncomplicated malaria attending the health care center, who meet the study
      inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site and followed up for 28 days. The
      follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and
      laboratory examinations. The study will provide efficacy data for both
      artemether-lumefantrine and chloroquine and will generate data on G6PD status in the region,
      which will provide vital information for policy makers in regards to the wider roll out of
      primaquine for the radical cure of vivax malaria.
