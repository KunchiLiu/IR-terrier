Participants entering the study on LANTUS®, insulin detemir or neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) QD will begin the study at their current dose SC. Participants will self titrate LY2963016 based on fasting blood glucose (FBG). Participants entering on insulin detemir or NPH twice a day will be started at 80% of the total daily dose SC. Participants will continue oral antihyperglycemic medication (OAM).</description>
