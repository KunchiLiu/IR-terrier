    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the antibiotic Flomoxef performs as well as
      Cefepime for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) in Russian
      adults.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Flomoxef. Flomoxef is being tested in people
      with a complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) including a kidney infection. This study
      will compare Flomoxef to Cefepime, another antibiotic. The study will enroll approximately
      80 participants.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of two
      treatment groups:

        -  Flomoxef - intravenous infusion 2g twice daily (every 12 hours); or

        -  Cefepime - intravenous infusion 1g twice daily (every 12 hours).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted at ten sites in the Russian Federation. The
      overall time to participate in this study is maximum 34 days. Participants will make six
      visits to the clinic.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve Resolution of all Clinical Symptoms of a Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (cUTI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 to 14</time_frame>
    <description>At the End of Treatment (EOT) visit (Day 7 to 14), the Investigator will collect information about each symptom and perform a judgement about the participant's status. Clinical symptoms present at trial entry are considered to be resolved if the participant has no pyuria; no fever; no malaise, flank pain, back pain, and/or costo-vertebral angle pain or tenderness; and no symptoms of dysuria, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, suprapubic discomfort, new urinary incontinence, or worsening of pre-existing incontinence.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Microbiological Success at the EOT and Test-of-Cure (TOC) visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 to 14, Day 14 to 21</time_frame>
    <description>A urine sample will be collected from the participants at the EOT and TOC (Day 14-21) visits to determine the level of uropathogen. Cultures of the urine sample will be processed by using a calibrated loop to identify a quantitative count of bacteria, with a lower limit of 10^4 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). Microbiological success is defined as a bacterial uropathogen level of less than 10^4 CFU/mL on urine culture. Microbiological response at the TOC visit will be based on the same grades as for the EOT visit.</description>

    <description>At Visit 3 (Day 3) and at the TOC (Day 14-21) and Late Follow-up Visit (LFU) visits (Day 30), the Investigator will collect information about each symptom and perform a judgement about the participant's status. Clinical symptoms present at trial entry are considered to be resolved if the participant has no pyuria; no fever; no malaise, flank pain, back pain, and/or costo-vertebral angle pain or tenderness; and no symptoms of dysuria, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, suprapubic discomfort, new urinary incontinence, or worsening of pre-existing incontinence.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Microbiologic Eradication of the Original Pathogen at the EOT and TOC visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 to 14, Day 14-21</time_frame>
    <description>A urine sample will be collected from the participants at the EOT and TOC visits to determine the level of uropathogen. Cultures of the urine sample will be processed by using a calibrated loop to identify a quantitative count of bacteria, with a lower limit of 10^4 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). Microbiological response at the TOC visit will be based on the same grades as for the EOT visit. The infection is considered to be eradicated if all uropathogens isolated at study entry at a level equal to or greater than 10^4 CFU/mL have decreased to less than 10^4 CFU/mL.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Microbiologic Persistence of the Original Pathogen at the EOT and TOC visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 to 14, Day 14-21</time_frame>
    <description>A urine sample will be collected from the participants at the EOT and TOC visits to determine the level of uropathogen. Cultures of the urine sample will be processed by using a calibrated loop to identify a quantitative count of bacteria, with a lower limit of 10^4 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). Microbiological response at the TOC visit will be based on the same grades as for the EOT visit. The infection is considered to be persistent if the level of the uropathogen has increased by greater than or equal to 10^4 CFU/mL from the time of study entry to that of the EOT and TOC visits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with a New Infection at the EOT and TOC Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 to 14, Day 14-21</time_frame>
    <description>A urine sample will be collected from the participants at the EOT and TOC visits to determine the level of uropathogen. Cultures of the urine sample will be processed by using a calibrated loop to identify a quantitative count of bacteria, with a lower limit of 10^4 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). A new infection is defined as the isolation and growth of a uropathogen other than the original pathogen.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with a Superinfection at the EOT and TOC Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 to 14, Day 14-21</time_frame>
    <description>A urine sample will be collected from the participants at the EOT and TOC visits to determine the level of uropathogen. Cultures of the urine sample will be processed by using a calibrated loop to identify a quantitative count of bacteria, with a lower limit of 10^4 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL). A superinfection is defined as growth of a uropathogen other than the original pathogen at a level greater than or equal to 10^4 CFU/mL at any time during the course of active therapy.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug.</description>
