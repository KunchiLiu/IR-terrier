    <textblock>
      Prospective, 3-cohort interventional study evaluating autologous tumor infiltrating
      lymphocyte (TIL) infusion (LN-144) followed by IL-2 after a non-myeloablative chemotherapy
      preparative regimen for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LN-144 is an autologous adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL
      manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients
      with metastatic melanoma. The cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients
      receiving a lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL
      followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
