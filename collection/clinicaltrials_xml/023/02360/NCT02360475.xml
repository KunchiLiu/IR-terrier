      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      different formulations of a single intramuscular dose of GSK Biologicals' investigational
      RSV vaccine, in healthy, non-pregnant women aged 18 to 45 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the

             specific procedure.

          -  Non-pregnant female between, and including, 18 and 45 years of age at the time of
             study vaccination.

             entering into the study.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the

             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/ product.

          -  Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make
             intramuscular injection unsafe.

          -  Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study
             protocol within the period starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after study

             diphtheria toxoid, or pertussis antigen-containing vaccine or to any component of
             Boostrix.

          -  History of encephalopathy of unknown aetiology occurring within 7 days following a

             months prior to study vaccination, or planned administration during the study period.
             Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/ or any blood products within the 3 months
             prior to study vaccination, or planned administration during the study period.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  History of or current autoimmune disease.
