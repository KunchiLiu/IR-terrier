    <textblock>
      This Phase I, multiple ascending dose study will seek to enroll subjects with progressive B
      cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with measurable disease (lesion &gt; 1.5 cm) (including SLL) OR
      relapsed/refractory B-cell CLL who have received standard treatment with at least one
      anti-CD20 antibody (e.g.; rituximab, ofatumumab)) containing front-line regimen that
      resulted in initial response, followed by relapse/recurrence and who are not eligible for
      any further approved biologic therapy, chemotherapy and/or autologous stem transplantation
      and/or refuse alternative approved therapies and/or are unlikely to achieve clinical benefit
      from any therapy of higher priority by Investigator assessment.

      This study is intended to provide investigators and sponsor with the following information
      regarding the investigational new drug MT-3724 in patients with relapsed/refractory
      non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma (including SLL) OR relapsed/refractory B-cell CLL:

        1. The maximum dose of a single course of MT-3724 given as intravenous (IV) infusions on
           Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 at which there are negligible side effects and/or at which
           maximum serum levels and/or at which maximum effect on blood lymphocytes are observed.
           Four dose levels will be investigated.

        2. The changes in MT-3724 serum levels and blood lymphocytes over time following IV doses
           at different points in the study.

        3. The changes and kinds of clinical and laboratory effects and side effects that may
           occur over repeated courses of MT-3724

        4. The changes in each subject's immune status and their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma following
           one or more cycles of 6 infusions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women, age 18 years or older

          -  Histologic diagnosis of B-Cell NHL. Histology based upon bone marrow biopsies and/or
             fine needle aspirates as the sole means of diagnosis are not acceptable. All patients
             must have measurable disease. Any tumor mass of at least 1.5 cm is acceptable.

          -  Presence of lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly with histopathological evaluation of
             a lymph node biopsy consistent with CLL. Clonality of the circulating B-lymphocytes
             should be confirmed at screening. Previously confirmed immunohistological diagnosis
             with a characteristic CD5+/CD20+ B--cell immunophenotype according to WHO criteria.
             CLL diagnosis requires an absolute peripheral blood monoclonal CD20+/CD5+
             B-lymphocyte count ≥ 5000 cells/μL for the duration of at least 3 months.

          -  Subject must have the following staging requirements:

               1. CLL: Rai Stage III or IV disease, or stage 0-II disease that meets National
                  Cancer Institute Working Group (NCIWG) criteria for active disease requiring
                  therapy that may include either of the following disease-related symptoms:

                    -  Progressive lymphadenopathy including bulky disease as defined by mass,

                       anticipated doubling time &lt; 6 months.

               2. NHL: Intermediate or high risk by Ann Arbor Staging with Cotswald Modifications
                  that meets criteria for active disease requiring therapy.

          -  History of at least one anti-CD20 antibody containing regimen that resulted in

             relapse/recurrence.

          -  Patients must have received all approved therapies known to provide clinical benefit
             for their disease subtype and for which they are eligible or must have refused these

             have lymphomas for which high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell
             transplantation (HD-ASCT) is considered a standard curative therapy, eligibility for
             this study requires that the patient's disease has relapsed after HD-ASCT, that the
             patient is not eligible for HD-ASCT, or that the patient has refused HD-ASCT.

          -  Patients with known central nervous system metastases may be enrolled if they have
             received radiotherapy, do not require chronic steroid therapy, have had computed
             tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain within 1 month of study entry
             that shows stable disease and they have no neurological symptoms other than low grade
             neuropathy.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &lt; 2.

          -  Patients must be at least 28 days past their last course of lymphoma or CLL
             treatment, at least 84 days past their last course of any anti-CD20 MAb treatment.
             Patients with pre-existing severe or life threatening side effects/conditions from
             prior therapy or due to other diseases may not be enrolled

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 3 days prior to initiating dosing. Male and female subjects
             with reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods while
             on study therapy and for 12 week following their last dose of study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who cannot comply with protocol requirements including clinic visits for
             intravenous infusions and birth control measures may not be enrolled.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or are breast feeding.

          -  Potential patients with a history of another cancer other than basal cell carcinoma
             or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cervical cancer in situ) may not be enrolled
             unless it is documented that their previous cancer was treated, they have been
             disease free for five or more years prior to starting this study and they are in
             their doctor's judgment at less than 30% risk of relapse of this previous malignancy.

          -  Patients with a peripheral blood total lymphocyte count of higher than 25,000/mm3 may
             not be enrolled.

          -  Patients cannot have experienced a significant (CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 with or without
             neutropenia) infection within 2 weeks of their first dose of MT-3724.

          -  Patients are not eligible if they are using any other approved or investigational
             anti-neoplastic therapies or any other investigational therapies for any other
             reason.

          -  Patients may not be receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy at a prednisone dose &gt;

             endocrine, metabolic, immunologic, hepatic or renal disease (including a history of

             affect study participation.

          -  Patients with known active Hepatitis C, HIV or a present history of Hepatitis B

          -  Patients must not have received any vaccines for 28 days prior to administration of

          -  Patients with a suspected allergy or sensitivity to any component of MT-3724 drug
             preparation based upon known allergies to compounds of a similar class who have had
             an anaphylactic or other severe infusion reaction to human immunoglobulin or
             monoclonal antibody administration are n ot eligible.

          -  Patients who have had an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are not
             eligible.
