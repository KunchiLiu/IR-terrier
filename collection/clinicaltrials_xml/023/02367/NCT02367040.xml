  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether copanlisib in combination with rituximab is
      superior to placebo in combination with rituximab in prolonging progression free survival
      (PFS) in patients with relapsed iNHL who have received one or more lines of treatment,
      including rituximab. Purpose of the study is also to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      copanlisib.

      Approximately 567 patients will be randomly assigned in in blinded treatment arms copanlisib
      plus rituximab or placebo plus rituximab.

      Copanlisib will be administered on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Placebo dosing
      will be administered on the same days as copanlisib.

      Rituximab dose is administered weekly during Cycle 1 on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22, and then on
      Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7 and 9. The maximum administration of rituximab is 8 times.

      Copanlisib or placebo treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or until another criterion is met for withdrawal from the study treatment.

      Following the end of treatment visit, patients will enter either the Safety follow-up or the
      Active follow-up period.

      The efficacy is measured by duration of progression-free survival (time between
      randomization and onset of a further progression of disease, or death from any cause).
      Progression of disease will be determined by radiologic tumor assessments to be performed at
      screening, as well as during the active follow up period tumor assessments every 8 weeks
      during Year 1, every 12 weeks during Year 2, and every 24 weeks during Year 3.

      Blood samples will be collected for safety analysis and pharmacokinetic analysis. Archival
      tumor tissue and blood samples will be collected for biomarker analysis and for central
      pathology review, fresh biopsy tissue and bone marrow will be collected but not mandatory.
