      This study is a phase I, open-label, parallel-group, comparative study to evaluate the
      effects of renal or hepatic impairment on pharmacokinetics of TAK-272 with a single oral
      administration of TAK-272 in patients with renal or hepatic impairment as compared with
      participants with normal renal and hepatic function.
