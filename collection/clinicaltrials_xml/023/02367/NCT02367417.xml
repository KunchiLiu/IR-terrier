      The objective of this study is to collect outcome information on patients requiring Total
      Knee Replacement (TKR) in primary or revision cases and therefore receiving the LINK®
      Endo-Model® SL® under routine conditions.

      Post Market Clinical Follow-ups (PMCF) through observational investigations are an important
      tool to detect infrequent complications or problems, events specific to defined patient
      populations and long term performance issues under routine condition. Against this
      background a prospective multi-center study with the LINK® Endo-Model® SL® will be
      conducted.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Patients requiring TKA and therefore receiving the LINK® Endo-Model® SL®. This
             includes patients who undergo revision surgery of prior knee arthroplasty after
             aseptic loosening, local infection, peri- or subprosthetic fracture or any other
             condition making revision of arthroplasty necessary as well as patients requiring
             primary arthroplasty with essential bone replacement.

          -  Between 18 and 70 years of age.

          -  Patient understands the conditions of the PMCF and is willing and able to comply with
             the postoperative scheduled clinical and radiographic evaluations and the prescribed
             postoperative management.

          -  Patient has signed the Informed Consent Form.

             outcome &lt; 70 points

          -  Patients with symptomatic OA of the hips, spine, ankles if it can interfere with the
             evaluation of the target knee

          -  Any current treatment for malignancy or any malignancy treatment within the previous
             2 years before the screening visit

          -  Any clinically significant pathology based on clinical history that the investigator
             feels may affect the study evaluation

          -  Any intercurrent chronic disease or condition that may interfere with the completion
             of the 5- year follow-up, such as liver disease, sever coronary disease, drug abuse,
             disordered mental state, or other clinically significant condition

          -  Patients who have significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease
             that may adversely affect gait and compromise functional recovery and evaluation

          -  Patients who have neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability
             to assess the performance of the device

          -  Patients with systemic or metabolic disorders leading to progressive bone
             deterioration

          -  Distinctive muscular, nerve, vascular or other diseases which put the affected limb
             at risk

          -  Insufficient bone integrity which prevents a stable anchorage of the prosthesis

          -  Female patient who is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the course of the
             investigation

          -  Prisoner
