    <textblock>
      This multi center randomized (1:1), double blind, placebo controlled Phase 1b/2 study is
      designed to compare the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD)
      of PF 04449913 or placebo when combined with azacitidine in patients with previously
      untreated Intermediate 2 or High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Acute Myeloid Leukemia
      (AML) with 20-30% blasts and multi lineage dysplasia, and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
      (CMML). This clinical study includes two components: (a) a Phase 1b safety lead in and (b) a
      randomized Phase 2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into
        the study:

          1. Morphologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following:

               1. MDS according to the WHO 2008 classification and bone marrow blasts &gt; or = 5%

               2. AML with 20-30 % BM blasts and multi lineage dysplasia, according to WHO 2008
                  classification and WBC &lt; 20x109/L

               3. CMML according to the WHO 2008 classification (Appendix 1) and BM blasts between
                  10% 19% and WBC &lt; 13x109/L

          2. MDS patients must have Intermediate 2 (1.5 to 2.0 points) or High Risk (≥2.5 points)
             disease according to the International Prognostic Scoring System 1997 (IPSS).

          3. MDS patients must have normal levels of vitamin B12 within the institutional range of
             normal as determined within 28 days of study entry.

          4. AML patients with 20- 30% BM blasts and multi lineage dysplasia, must have stable
             blast counts per Investigator's judgment.

          5. Clinical indication for treatment with azacitidine for MDS, AML or CMML.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with any of the following may not be included in the study:

          1. Patients with AML who are candidates for standard induction chemotherapy as first
             line treatment.

          2. Therapy related (secondary to radiation or chemotherapy) MDS or AML.

          3. Prior hypomethylating agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy for MDS, AML or CMML (prior
             immunosuppressive therapy and hydroxyurea are permitted provided that treatment is
             stopped within 8 and 2 weeks from study entry, respectively).

          4. Previous hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

          5. Prior treatment with a licensed or experimental smoothened inhibitor (SMOi) and/or
             hypomethylating agent (HMA).
