    <textblock>
      Participants will be inducted with sublingual film strip. This is a 24-week non-residential
      study with participants being randomized after meeting criteria. On Day 1 and Day 29 (± 2
      days) participants will receive subcutaneous injections of high dose or placebo. Thereafter,
      participants will receive 4 injections (once every 28 days ± 2 days) of high or low doses or
      placebo.
