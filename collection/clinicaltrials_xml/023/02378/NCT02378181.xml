  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study deploys a strategy to develop and evaluate a training-efficient, multimedia
      patient-centered Health Education Toolkit to promote shared decision making between
      counselors and patients. An existing evidence-based toolkit intervention will be adapted and
      redesigned by a patient and provider team into an engaging, narrative graphic novel
      curriculum useful in group and individual counseling. The proven behavioral interventions
      will be augmented with health education material focused on medication assisted treatment
      (MAT) and HIV risk reduction. We will test whether exposure to the Toolkit (TK) can reduce
      substance use and HIV risk, while increasing engagement with MAT.

      An existing evidence-based toolkit intervention will be adapted and redesigned by a patient
      and provider team into an engaging, narrative graphic novel curriculum useful in group and
      individual counseling. The proven behavioral interventions will be augmented with health
      education material focused on medication assisted treatment (MAT) and HIV risk reduction.
      Together, these materials will comprise the Health Education Toolkit. The Health Education
      Toolkit (TK) will employ a shared decision making model to encourage 1) increased recovery
      engagement by patients, and 2) patient engagement in deciding whether to initiate and adhere
      to MAT. We will conduct a two-year, randomized controlled trial of 350 patients with active
      alcohol substance use disorders (SUDs) enrolled in outpatient treatment and will follow them
      over 6 months. We will test whether patients randomized to receive the TK curriculum will
      demonstrate larger reductions in substance use (drug and alcohol) and increases in
      abstinence, b) more attendance at specialty substance abuse intervention and treatment
      sessions, c) greater rates of initiating MAT for alcohol dependence, and d) reduced HIV
      transmission risk behaviors and greater rates of HIV testing over the 6-month follow-up
      period as compared to patients receiving treatment-as-usual (TAU).
