    <textblock>
      A group of freshman volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Both groups were
      given an internet based scale (Withings). The experimental group was asked to weigh
      themselves daily. The controls were asked to weigh themselves three times within one week
      every six months in response to being contacted by our researchers.
