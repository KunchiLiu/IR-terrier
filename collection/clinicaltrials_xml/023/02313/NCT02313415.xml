      Study of the treatment of infertility caused by severe intrauterine adhesions or endometrial
      dysplasia by collagen scaffold loaded with umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem
      cells, and to provide clinical evidence for the treatment of uterine infertility.

    <textblock>
      Infertility is defined as a women fails to become pregnant after having a normal sex life
      for two years without contraception. There is no effective treatment to the infertility
      caused by severe intrauterine adhesions or endometrial dysplasia which affects embryos
      implantation. The existing drugs, physical or surgical treatments had no significant effects
      to severe intrauterine adhesions.Collagen is the main component of the extracellular matrix
      with good biocompatibility, and it has been approved for the reparation of skin and oral
      mucosa by State Food and Drug Administration. umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem
      cells have been used in the clinical treatment of diseases, and achieved good results. In
      this study, collagen scaffold and umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells are
      combined, and they showed good biological safety

    <description>Before considering whether patients meet the inclusion criteria, they are diagnosed with severe intrauterine adhesions uterus, endometrial dysplasia. And after that there will be history taking, physical examination, chromosome examination, B-ultrasound examination, hysteroscopy examination and so on.
If they agree to participate, they will receive separation of adhesions by hysteroscopy surgery and collagen scaffold loaded with umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells will be putted in the uterine cavity. Postoperative observation period is about three months, including B-ultrasound examination once a month and hysteroscopy after 3 months. The doctor will select an appropriate time for pregnancy and follow-up including requiring patients to do some unscheduled visits.</description>
