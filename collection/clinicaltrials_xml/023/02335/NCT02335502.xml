          4. Failed conservative treatments for chronic pain including but not limited to
             pharmacological therapy, physical therapy and interventional pain procedures for
             chronic pain

          5. Minimum baseline pain rating of 60 mm on the Visual Analog Scale in the primary
             region of pain

          6. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is psychologically appropriate for
             the implantation for an active implantable medical device

          7. Subject is able to provide written informed consent

          8. Subject speaks Dutch or English

        Exclusion Criteria:

             pregnant or is unwilling to use approved birth control

          2. Escalating or changing pain condition within the past month as evidenced by
             investigator examination

          3. Subject has had corticosteroid therapy at an intended site of stimulation within the
             past 30 days

          4. Subject has had radiofrequency treatment of an intended target Dorsal Root Ganglion
             within the past 3 months

          5. Subject currently has an active implantable device including implantable cardioverter
             defibrillator, pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator or intrathecal drug pump

          6. Patient has pain only or primarily within a cervical dermatomal distribution

          7. Subject is unable to operate the device

          8. Subjects with indwelling devices that may pose an increased risk of infection
