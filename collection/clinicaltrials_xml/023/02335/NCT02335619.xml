  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently at the BC Cancer Agency, oncologists decide when to refer a patient to the Pain
      and Symptom Management/Palliative Care (PSMPC) team, and their decisions are made
      subjectively and without standard guidelines/symptom assessment tools. Patients are often
      referred late in their treatment. The PSMPC team sees patients in their own clinic,
      separately from the oncologists, and do not often collaborate in a patient's care.

      Early integration of palliative care into oncological care has been shown to improve quality
      of life and to prolong survival, as well as to reduce inappropriately aggressive oncological
      care at end of life, and reduce costs of care. We will test an early oncology-integrated
      palliative care model, with the aims of determining whether 1) the introduction of PSMPC
      support at the time of diagnosis leads to better symptom management and quality of life of
      patients, 2) early integration of palliative care into medical oncology care reduces
      aggressiveness of cancer treatment near end of life, and 3) a fully integrated service
      delivery model is sustainable.

      Gastrointestinal (GI) medical oncologists will be assigned to intervention or control
      groups, according to whether or not they have clinics scheduled on 2 specific half days each
      week, to coincide with PSMPC clinics. New patients attending the specified clinics under
      each oncologist will be automatically fall under whichever group their oncologist has been
      assigned. Control patients will be those seen at clinics other than the 2 specified
      intervention clinics.

      Patients will be approached for study participation in the waiting room of the GI clinic as
      they await their first oncology appointment. Those who agree to participate will be asked to
      complete a symptom assessment questionnaire at baseline and once a month for 4 months. This
      timing is meant to coincide with their regularly scheduled follow up appointments with the
      GI oncologist.

      Symptom scores from the completed assessment forms will be entered into a study database,
      created with the BC Cancer Agency IDs of the study participants alongside an anonymized
      study ID.
