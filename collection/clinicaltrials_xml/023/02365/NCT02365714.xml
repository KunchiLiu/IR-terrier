    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively evaluate the technical feasibility, acute toxicity, late
      effects and oncologic outcomes of CyberKnife Stereotactic Accelerated Partial Breast
      Irradiation (CK-SAPBI) in early stage breast cancer. It will evaluate quality of life (QOL)
      issues as they relate to treatment-related side effects and cosmetic results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  -Newly diagnosed Stage 0 or I breast cancer.

          -  On histological examination, the tumor must be DCIS or invasive non-lobular carcinoma
             of the breast

          -  Surgical treatment of the breast must have been wide excision, lumpectomy or partial
             mastectomy

          -  Age 50 years or greater

          -  ER positive: (≥1% of breast tumor cells express ER in their nuclei)

          -  PR (progesterone receptor) positive: (≥ 1% of breast tumor cells express PR in their
             nuclei)

          -  Her2 negative (IHC 0-1+; for IHC 2+, FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) must
             be non-amplified)

          -  Subjects with invasive tumors should undergo axillary sentinel lymph node evaluation
             or axillary lymph node dissection.

          -  Negative inked surgical margins of excision or re-excision, clear of invasive tumor
             (no cells on ink) and DCIS by at least 1 mm

          -  Negative post-excision or post-reexcision mammography if cancer presented with
             malignancy-associated microcalcifications with no remaining suspicious calcifications
             in the breast before radiotherapy. Alternatively, a specimen radiograph can be
             obtained showing all the suspicious calcifications.

          -  No involved axillary lymph nodes, N0(i+) allowed

          -  Enrollment and the plan to initiate of CyberKnife therapy within 12 weeks of the last
             breast cancer surgery.

          -  Target lumpectomy cavity/whole breast reference volume must be &lt;30% based on
             treatment planning CT

          -  Signed study-specific informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  -Patients with invasive lobular carcinoma or nonepithelial breast malignancies such
             as sarcoma or lymphoma.

          -  Patients with tumors greater than 2 cm

          -  Patients with surgical margins which cannot be microscopically assessed or not
             cleared by at least 2mm at pathological evaluation.

          -  Patients with multicentric carcinoma or with other clinically or radiographically
             suspicious areas in the ipsilateral breast unless confirmed to be negative for
             malignancy by biopsy. Breast MRI will be recommended to exclude multicentric disease
             and additional suspicious areas will require biopsy to exclude malignancy.

          -  Patient with lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI).

          -  Patients with involved axillary nodes.

          -  Patients with collagen vascular diseases.

          -  Patient with known deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations or known mutations in other high
             penetrance genes (TP53, STK11, PTEN-phosphatase and tensin homolog, CDH1)

          -  Patients with prior ipsilateral breast irradiation.

          -  Patients with prior ipsilateral thoracic irradiation.

          -  Patients with Paget's disease of the nipple.

          -  Patients with diffuse suspicious microcalcifications.

          -  Patients with suspicious microcalcifications remaining on the post-excision
             mammogram.

          -  Patients receiving (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy other than hormonal therapy

          -  Patients with oncoplastic reconstruction and absence of surgical clips
