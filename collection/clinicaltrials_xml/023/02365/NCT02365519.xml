    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LME636 compared to vehicle in the
      reduction of ocular symptoms and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LME636, when
      administered topically for up to 42 days, in subjects with severe dry eye disease.

      This study is organized into 2 phases. Following a 2-week identification phase, eligible
      subjects with severe dry eye disease (DED) will be randomized into the treatment phase and
      will be dispensed study treatment for 10 weeks.
