      The purpose of this study is to image human prostate tissue using a new transrectal
      photoacoustic imaging probe and correlate this with ultrasound and MRI imaging performed
      once the specimen has been surgically removed. We hope to see what we can visualize with our
      device as this has never been done before. Eventually, we hope to use a similar device to
      image the prostate in men being seen by their doctor for prostate cancer.
