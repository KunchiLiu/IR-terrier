      The purpose of the Feasibility study is to characterize the safety of the Valiant Mona LSA
      Thoracic Stent Graft System, including an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the
      device acutely and at the 30 day visit in the identified subject population. This study will
      also evaluate the current instructions for use and may direct changes to the delivery and
      deployment steps.

      The purpose of the expansion to the Feasibility Study is to characterize the Valiant Mona
      LSA Thoracic Stent Graft System, in particular to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      device acutely and at the 30 day visit, in subjects enrolled with chronic, Type B
      dissections.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subject understands and has signed an Informed Consent approved by the Sponsor and by
             the IRB for this study.

          -  Subject must be considered a candidate for revascularization of the LSA.

          -  Subject must be able to tolerate a surgical revascularization of the LSA.

          -  Subject has a DTA which will require coverage of the LSA and is:

        a fusiform aneurysm with diameter of ≥ 5.5 cm OR is &gt; 2 times the diameter of the
        non-aneurysmal thoracic aorta; AND/OR a saccular aneurysm or penetrating atherosclerotic
        ulcer (ulcer defined as ≥ 10 mm in depth and 20 mm in diameter) OR a chronic type B
        dissection defined as &gt; 30 days from symptom onset and is complicated with an aortic
        diameter ≥ 5.5 cm or has progressive aortic enlargement (&gt; 5 mm/year).

          -  Subject has a healthy, non-diseased aortic proximal seal zone of at least 10 mm from
             the LCC to the LSA and at least 5 mm landing zone distal to the LSA and proximal to
             the start of the aneurysm/ulcer or 5 mm landing zone distal to the LSA to the
             proximal entry tear for dissection.

          -  Subject has a non-diseased aortic diameter between 25 mm and 42 mm (fusiform/saccular
             aneurysms or penetrating ulcers) or 28 mm to 44 mm (chronic type B dissections);

          -  Subject has a LSA with a diameter between 8 mm and 13 mm.

          -  Subject has sufficient landing zone within the LSA to accommodate the BSG without
             occlusion of any significant vessels

          -  Subject has patent brachial arteries, iliac or femoral arteries, or can tolerate a
             conduit that will allow endovascular access to the aneurysmal site with the delivery
             system of the appropriate sized device chosen for treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        •Subject has a condition requiring prospective revascularization of the LSA, including:

          -  Subject has significant and/or circumferential aortic mural thrombus at either the
             proximal or distal attachment sites that would compromise fixation and seal of the

          -  Subject has a known allergy or intolerance to the device components.

          -  Subject has a body habitus which prevents adequate visualization of the aorta.

          -  Subject has coronary artery disease with unstable angina and has not received
             treatment.

          -  Subject has a connective tissue disease (e.g. Marfan's syndrome, medial
             degeneration).

          -  Subject has active systemic infection and/or a mycotic aneurysm.

          -  Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or device clinical
             trial that would interfere with the observations of this study.

          -  Subject has other medical, social, or psychological problems that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, will interfere with treatment and follow-up procedures.

          -  Subject has a life expectancy of less than 1 year.

          -  Subject requires treatment of an infrarenal aneurysm at the time of the implantation.

          -  Subject has had previous surgical or endovascular treatment of an infra-renal aortic
             aneurysm.

          -  Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy, or refuses blood
             transfusion.

          -  Subject has had a cerebral vascular accident (CVA) within the prior 3 months.

          -  Subject has had a myocardial infarction (MI) within the prior 3 months.
