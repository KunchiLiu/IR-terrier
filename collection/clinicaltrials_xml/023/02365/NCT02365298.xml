  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vitro studies show that some hydrogel materials uptake more lysozyme than other hydrogel
      materials and that this protein remains largely active and promotes reduced cytokine
      response in an in vitro culture of human corneal epithelial cells. This study investigates
      whether these data transfer to the in vivo situation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the Statement of Informed Consent and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             the clinical protocol.

          3. The subject must be willing to follow instructions and maintain the appointment
             schedule.

          4. The subject must be between 18 and 40 years of age (inclusive).

          5. The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in

          6. The subject's refractive cylinder must not exceed -1.25DC in each eye after vertexing
             to the corneal plane.

          7. The subject must be a current wearer of spherical, soft contact lenses (no toric,
             bifocal or multifocal contact lenses, no extended wear or monovision) for at least 5
             days/week and at least 8 hours/day during to month prior to enrollment.

          8. The subject must own a wearable pair of spectacles and wear them the day of the
             initial visit.

          9. The subject must be an existing wearer of spherical soft contact lenses in both eyes.

         10. The subject must have normal eye (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

         11. The subject must be able to wear the study lenses for a minimum seven hours per day.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact
             lens wear; clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar
             injection which might interfere with contact lens wear.

         10. Any know hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to study products.

         11. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within seven
             days prior to study enrollment.

         12. Employee or family member of the Center for Contact Lens Research (e.g.,
             Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).
