  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to identify the most appropriate smoking cessation treatments for smokers based
      on genetic information. Smokers try to quit smoking but relapses are common.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to determine whether genetic markers can be used to optimize smoking cessation
      pharmacotherapy to enhance efficacy, medication adherence, and reduce side effects. Smoking
      is a leading cause of preventable death and disability, and smoking cessation reverses the
      risk of mortality. However, cessation failure is common despite available cessation
      medications, which are associated with different efficacy, side effects, adherence, use
      constraints, and costs. This challenge can be addressed by improving current treatments via
      personalized medicine based on individual genetic markers to maximize efficacy and minimize
      side effects.

      We propose a prospective, genotype-based stratified randomization trial to compare two
      smoking cessation medications (combination NRT [patch and lozenge], varenicline vs. placebo)
      for 3 months in 720 smokers with known genotypes. This study uses a stratified randomization
      trial design based on a subject's pertinent genotype for smoking cessation. Specifically, in
      Aim 1, we will determine if CHRNA5 genotype moderates the effect of medication (combination
      NRT, varenicline, vs. placebo) on abstinence. In Aim 2, we will determine if CHRNA5 genotype
      predicts medication adherence and side effects. In Aim 3, we will incorporate multiple
      genotypes and other predictors in order to develop a clinical treatment assignment algorithm
      for cessation success. This work can result in improved physician care of patients who
      smoke, overall smoking cessation success, and prevention of cancer, heart, and lung disease.
