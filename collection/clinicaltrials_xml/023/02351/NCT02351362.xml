  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given there is substantial loss to follow-up soon after delivery among HIV-positive pregnant
      women in South Africa, we will conduct a pilot study of an innovative approach to improve
      retention in care targeted to this specific population at high risk of drop-out. The problem
      of poor retention in care is well documented, but interventions to address the issue are
      lacking. In order to design an effective intervention that will be tested in a future
      randomized controlled trial, we will first complete preliminary research via a pilot study
      in order to determine the feasibility and acceptability of an incentive program (i.e., a
      supermarket voucher) to reduce loss to follow-up among HIV-positive women after delivery.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of a voucher incentive
      intervention aimed at improving retention in postpartum HIV care

      Secondary objectives include: a) to determine the efficacy of the intervention at increasing
      postpartum retention; b) to determine the acceptability of the intervention in terms of
      women's preferences for the intervention compared to other possible interventions; c) to
      assess differences in patient retention among women newly diagnosed with HIV vs. those who
      knew their HIV-positive status before pregnancy; and d) to assess differences in patient
      retention among women who initiated ART during pregnancy vs. those who were on ART before
      becoming pregnant.

      We will enroll up to 200 adult (≥18 years), pregnant, HIV-positive women attending antenatal
      care who have not previously enrolled in the study at Hikhensile Clinic, Johannesburg, South
      Africa. The study will be a prospective intervention cohort study with historical controls.
      Intervention subjects will receive a one-time supermarket voucher of R50 (about $5.00) for
      participants who return for at least one postpartum visit at the study clinic within 10
      weeks of delivery.
