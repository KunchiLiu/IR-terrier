    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of symptom control in
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) participants following treatment with
      dexlansoprazole.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. A dual delayed release
      formulation of dexlansoprazole, referred to as dexlansoprazole Modified Release
      (dexlansoprazole MR) is being tested to treat people who have gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD). This study will look at the healing of the esophageal lining of the GERD
      patients who take dexlansoprazole MR.

      Participants will be assigned to two study groups based on the endoscopy screening
      procedures to receive treatments as follows:

        1. a non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) group; dexlansoprazole 30 mg QD for 4 weeks.

        2. an erosive esophagitis (EE) study group; dexlansoprazole 60 mg QD for 8 weeks, with an
           interim clinical evaluation at Week 4 and a clinical evaluation and endoscopy at week
           8.

      The study will enroll approximately 300 patients; 200 in the dexlansoprazole 30 mg QD and
      100 in the dexlansoprazole 60 mg groups.

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule in the morning each day throughout the
      study. All participants will be asked to record the presence and maximum severity of daytime
      and nighttime heartburn and regurgitation symptoms during screening and, if assigned to a
      treatment group, throughout the duration of the study using the supplied paper diary.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea). The
      overall time to participate in this study is up to 8 weeks. Participants will make up to 3
      visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after the last dose of
      study drug for a follow-up assessment.
