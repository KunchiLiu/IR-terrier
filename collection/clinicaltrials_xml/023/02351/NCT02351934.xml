      This study will assess if administration of a loop diuretic, specifically furosemide, to
      achieve euvolemia can safely reduce length of stay following colorectal surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  All elective colorectal surgeries (CRS) utilizing the enhanced recovery pathway (ERP)

          -  The surgery involves resection

        Exclusion Criteria

        Exclusion Criteria for Randomization:

          -  Surgeries involving intraoperative radiation

          -  Ileostomy closures, when performed as the only surgical intervention

          -  Surgeries involving multiple disciplines (e.g., colorectal plus general surgery,
             colorectal plus gynecology surgery) except for colorectal surgeries plus ureteral
             stent placements.

          -  Chronic loop diuretic therapy (i.e., bumetanide, torsemide, furosemide, ethacrynic
             acid) including as needed administration of such therapy

          -  Patients receiving dialysis

          -  Creatinine clearance, calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation, less than 30
             mL/min.

          -  Inpatient prior to surgery

          -  Allergy to furosemide

          -  Allergy to sulfa drugs if the allergy involves anaphylactic reaction

          -  Lack of serum creatinine concentration within 3 months preceding the surgery AND
             diagnosis of chronic kidney disease

        Exclusion Criteria for Intervention (applies to both the intervention and control arm):

          -  Patient's weight on POD #1 and POD #2 is less than preoperative weight.

          -  Blood pressure criteria: systolic blood pressure criteria less than 90 mmHg or
             greater than 30 mmHg below baseline on POD #1 and/or POD #2 immediately prior to
             administration of study drug.

          -  Complications within 48 hours of surgery

          -  Abscess (infected fluid collection, treated with CT drainage)

          -  Leak (defined by CT drainage or reoperation)

          -  Wound infection (treated with either antibiotics and/or open packing)

          -  Bowel obstruction (treated with reoperation)

          -  Reoperation

          -  Hemorrhage

          -  Weight change since admission on POD #1: &gt; 5 kg

          -  Acute kidney injury on POD #1 and POD#2 defined as SCr increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or
             increase to ≥ 150% to 200% (1.5- to 2-fold) from baseline
