  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Funded by the Patient Centered Outcome Research Institute (PCORI), nationally recognized
      leaders in health care and research methods are partnering with patients and caregivers to
      evaluate the effectiveness of current efforts at improving care transitions and develop
      recommendations on best practices for patient-centered care transitions and guidance for
      spreading them across the U.S.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the U.S. suffer harm too often as they move between sites of health care, and
      their caregivers experience significant burden. Unfortunately, the usual approach to health
      care does not support continuity and coordination during such &quot;care transitions&quot; between
      hospitals, clinics, home or nursing homes. Poorly managed patient care transitions can lead
      to worsening symptoms, adverse effects from medications, unaddressed test results, failed
      follow-up testing, and excess rehospitalizations and ER visits.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Identify the transitional care outcomes and components that matter most to patients and
           caregivers.

        2. Determine which evidence-based transitional care components (TCCs) or clusters most
           effectively yield patient and caregiver desired outcomes overall and among diverse
           patient and caregiver populations in different types of care settings and communities.

        3. Identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of specific TCCs or clusters
           of TCCs for different types of care settings and communities.

        4. Develop recommendations for dissemination and implementation of the findings on the
           best evidence regarding how to achieve optimal TC services and outcomes for patients,
           caregivers and providers.

      Study Design:

      Capitalizing on the opportunity for a natural experiment observational study, the research
      team will conduct qualitative and quantitative studies. This three-year study is divided
      into two distinct phases. During the first phase, Project ACHIEVE will use focus groups,
      with patients, caregivers, providers, and site visits to identify the transitional care
      outcomes and service components that matter most to patients. In this first phase, the team
      will refine and validate outcome assessment instruments and secure commitments from
      institutions and community based organizations participating in the study. During the second
      phase, the team will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of multi-component care
      transitions programs occurring across the U.S.

      Outcomes and Impact:

      Through rigorous study and evaluation, Project ACHIEVE will:

        1. Identify best practices in care transitions that matter most to patients and their
           caregivers, and reduce excess emergency department and hospital utilization.

        2. Develop a toolkit to guide informed decisions and spread these best practices across
           the U.S.

        3. Develop Care Transitions Surveys that can standardize evaluation of patients' and
           caregivers' experience with care transitions.
