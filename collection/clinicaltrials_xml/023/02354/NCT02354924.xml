  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the VISCO (Olifilcon A) soft contact lens
      could be prescribed as a supportive care for myopic persons.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study will involve at least 50 evaluable subjects divided evenly
      among 5 study sites in Taiwan. Each study site will enroll 12 subjects at least. The ration
      of evaluable test subjects to control subjects will be 2 to 1. Subjects who have normal
      ocular health and conform to a set of standard criteria will wear one of the study lenses on
      two eyes and follow up for 3 months (90 days). Lenses will be assigned to subject according
      to a predetermined randomized order. It is necessary to remove contact lenses every day and
      replace after 30 days. Any unscheduled visit will be allowed when there is a medication
      necessary. The data for slit lamp findings, symptoms/problems/complaints, keratometry (K)
      reading, refractive changes (absolute value), visual acuity data, average wear time (AWT),
      discontinuations, and lens replacement will be collected to claim that the VISCO Soft
      Contact Lens is as safe and effective as BIOFINITY (comfilcon A) Soft Contact Lens
      (CooperVision).

    <description>Any slit lamp finding &gt; Grade 2; Measured on a scale of 0-4 with 0=no findings and 4=severe findings. Edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, Injection, tarsal abnormalities, and other complications were measured.</description>

    <description>Incident rate for Subjective Responses to comfort/symptoms/complaints were measured at every visit. Questionnaire for subjective comfort is assessed at final visit for comfort, watery, photophobia, halos, itchy/burning, spectacle blur, variable vision, blurred vision, lens needs cleaning and over all lens preference. The scale for questionnaire is 1=Severe Burning to 10=No Burning for each eye; 10 represented the least favorable rating and 100 represented the most favorable rating.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject should have normal eyes and use no ocular medications

          -  Subject with -1.00 to -10.00 D myopia, less than -1.25 D astigmatism

          -  VA correctable to 20/25 or better.

          -  Willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the
