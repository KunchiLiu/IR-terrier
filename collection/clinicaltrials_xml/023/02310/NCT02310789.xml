  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies of lumacaftor + ivacaftor (combo therapy) produced better FEV1 (forced
      expiratory volume in 1 second) improvements than ivacaftor alone, without further
      improvement in sweat chloride results.

      To help understand why sweat chloride was unresponsive, the investigators will use a newly
      developed sweat secretion test that provides accurate, in vivo readout of CFTR (cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) function in the sweat gland secretory coil.

      The investigators devised a protocol to determine if short courses of ivacaftor (3.5 days)
      will produce significant increases in WT (Wild-Type, i.e. normal) CFTR open probability by
      measuring CFTR-dependent sweating (C-sweat) in subjects with WT CFTR.

    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by malfunctioning of a protein called CFTR.

      CF affects various organs including the sweat glands and the lungs. An FDA approved drug
      called ivacaftor helps some people with CF, and laboratory tests show that it produces
      further improvement when combined with an investigational drug called lumacaftor. However,
      results from clinical tests of the two drugs used together gave mixed results: lung function
      improved but sweat gland function did not improve. This study will measure CFTR-dependent
      sweat rate to test the hypothesis that CFTR in the normal sweat glands might be functioning
      at peak efficiency, and so can't be improved further with ivacaftor, thus accounting for the
      apparent discrepancy between lung function and sweat gland results. CFTR-dependent sweat
      rate is important to understanding CF because it is a very accurate measure of CFTR
      function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults without a Cystic Fibrosis (CF) mutation

          -  Carriers with a known CF mutation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented liver disease

          2. Participants should not be taking:

               -  medicines that are strong CYP3A (Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A)
                  inducers, such as:

                    -  the antibiotics rifampin and rifabutin;

                    -  seizure medications (phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin); and

                    -  the herbal supplement St. John's Wort, substantially decreases exposure of
                       ivacaftor and may diminish effectiveness.
