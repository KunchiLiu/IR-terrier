  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the clinical trial is to investigate safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of OBI-833/OBI-821 in subjects with metastatic incurable solid tumors, such
      as gastric, lung,colorectal or breast cancer. Meanwhile, the tumor response and humoral
      immune responses, i.e.,anti-Globo H IgG and IgM production following administration of
      OBI-833/OBI-821 will be assessed as the secondary objective of this study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The First-In-Human clinical trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of three doses
      of OBI-833 (10,30 and 100μg) along with a fixed dose of 100μg OBI-821 adjuvant in a small
      number of patients (N=26) with late stage gastric, colorectal, breast and lung cancers.
      Patients will receive a total 10 doses subcutaneously over 24 weeks, and will be evaluated
      for safety and immune response during the 24 week treatment period and subsequently observed
      for additional 12 weeks post-treatment. In addition to the standard battery of safety tests,
      evaluations will also include immunological response, tumor markers and clinical endpoints
      such as disease or progression free survival (RECIST 1.1).

    <description>Single Arm. Each subject will be given a total of 10 doses of OBI-833/OBI-821 subcutaneously at weeks 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,20,and 24 (Visits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10, respectively). Post treatment, subjects will be continually evaluated for safety and immune response every 4 weeks until the end of study, which is 12 weeks after the last dose, i.e., week 36. Subsequently, subjects will be followed for survival every 8 weeks up to 12 months after the end of study.</description>

             breast cancer on file

          3. Subjects with recurrent or metastatic incurable disease that failed to respond to at
             least one line of anticancer standard therapy and for which standard treatment is no
             longer effective or tolerable.

          4. Measurable disease (i.e., present with at least one measurable lesion per RECIST,
             version 1.1.

          5. Performance status: ECOG ≤ 1

          6. Organ Function Requirements - Subjects must have adequate organ functions as defined
             below:
