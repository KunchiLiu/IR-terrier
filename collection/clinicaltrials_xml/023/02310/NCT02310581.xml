  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of up to 3 dosing regimens of
      Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray and/or matching placebo in subjects with moderate to severe
      postoperative pain after bunionectomy. The study will comprise 4 periods: the Screening
      Period, the Surgical Period, the Treatment Period, and the Follow-up Period.

      Subjects will be admitted to the study site on the morning of the scheduled surgery, will
      remain at the study site until postoperative Day 3 (a total of 3 nights at the study site),
      and will return for the Follow-up Visit 5 to 9 days after surgery.
