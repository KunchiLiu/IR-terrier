  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Powered exoskeletons have emerged recently, promising to offer walking to individuals with
      severe spinal cord injury who are unable to walk. We will use the ReWalk exoskeleton to
      train walking in individuals with chronic, severe spinal cord injury. We will determine the
      characteristics of individuals who most benefit from such training, and identify the
      neuroplasticity induced by the training. We will further determine the feasibility of the
      ReWalk for home and community ambulation.

      A prospective, pilot, cohort study design will recruit participants to train intensively for
      a 3 month period. The training sessions will be documented in detail, including number of
      steps taken, speed of walking, distance of walking. Once walking speed has plateaued, we
      will evaluate the feasibility of using the device in a home-like environment and in the
      community.

      At the end of this study, we will have a good idea of the capability of the ReWalk to assist
      walking in those with severe SCI. We will better understand which individuals are most
      likely to benefit from the ReWalk. We will know how training in the ReWalk changes the
      neural connections between the brain and the spinal cord so that we can better guide the
      training protocol. Finally, we will identify limitations of the ReWalk for home and
      community use, so that exoskeletons can be improved in the future to maximize their benefit
      to people with SCI.
