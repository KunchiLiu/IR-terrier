  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HCV antiviral therapy has evolved rapidly in recent years and access to these medications
      has improved. While SVR is associated with improved liver outcomes, the rate of liver
      fibrosis regression with SVR is variable and predictors of regression are not well
      established. In addition, achieving SVR in patients with cirrhosis does not necessarily
      prevent decompensation or eliminate the risk of HCC. A better understanding of the role
      insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism have on these outcomes in HCV patients
      who achieve SVR are needed.

      Identifying and targeting potentially modifiable risk factors such as IR may be of
      significant importance in preventing progression of and promoting regression of liver
      fibrosis, reducing mortality and improving outcomes for HCV-HIV co-infected and
      HCV-mono-infected patients.

      This proposed pilot study will be the first to evaluate the role of Metformin on liver
      fibrosis in HCV-HIV co-infected and HCV mono-infected patients with IR receiving DAA HCV
      treatment.

      If Metformin is effective in reducing liver fibrosis in this patient population, this will
      represent a well-tolerated, easy to administer, inexpensive therapy that will protect
      against negative HCV outcomes. This study will also be an opportunity to evaluate the impact
      of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia have on viral clearance HCV-infected patients
      treated with interferon-free regimens. In addition, the study will further explore the
      relationship between HCV, insulin resistance and AFP levels.
