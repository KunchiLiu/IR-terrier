      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate the effectiveness of a manualized, 20-week
      group cognitive rehabilitation (CR) and exposure therapy (ET) course for compulsive
      hoarding. The overarching aim is to understand whether this course will decrease the core
      symptoms of hoarding and associated features.

                  relevant symptoms of hoarding as indicated by scores on the Hoarding Rating
                  Scale Interview (HRS-I) and/or on the Saving Inventory-Revised (SIR).

               -  Comorbid mood and anxiety disorders are permitted.

               -  English-speaking
