  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the safety &amp; efficacy of low dose ketamine and morphine
      versus morphine alone for acute generalized pain in the Emergency Department (ED). The
      investigators are also interested to investigate whether low-dose ketamine is a safe and
      effective alternative option to opioids for the acute treatment of pain in the Emergency
      Department.

      The agents that are available in the department includes acetaminophen, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory (NSAIDS) and opioids. In most cases, acetaminophen and NSAIDS are not
      adequate to manage acute pain crisis. There is also heightening concerns for increased
      opioid use or abuse by patients. Since the HCAPHS survey includes various questions which
      inquires about patient perception of pain management in the department, the investigators
      are interested in investigating the safety and efficacy of low-dose ketamine to as an
      alternative method to opioids for the acute management of pain. There has been limited,
      mostly observational pilot studies, published in the literature. Limited data in the
      literature have reported the incidence of nausea and vomiting ranged from 3-13%. All
      published literature administered low-dose ketamine as an intravenous push. To the best of
      our knowledge our study would be the first study to administer low-dose ketamine as a short
      bolus infusion to mitigate the incidence of nausea and vomiting. The investigators believe
      our study would provide important scientific data to fill the theoretical gap that low-dose
      ketamine at 0.3mg/kg/dose may be a safe and effective agent for acute pain management in an
      ED that is located in the center of a densely populated urban area.

      The aim of the study is to compare the safety &amp; efficacy of low dose ketamine and morphine
      versus morphine alone for acute generalized pain in the Emergency Department (ED). The is a
      randomized double blind placebo controlled trial to investigate the effects of low dose
      ketamine and morphine versus placebo and morphine for the management of acute pain in the
      ED.
