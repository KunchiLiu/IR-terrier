    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Miglustat restores the function of the
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in adult patients with cystic
      fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. To determine whether Miglustat can restore the function of the CFTR protein in adult
           patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation

        2. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Miglustat in adult
           patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.

        3. To investigate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic of Miglustat in adult patients with
           cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del mutation.
