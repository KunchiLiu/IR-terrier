    <description>Dose Escalation: Entospletinib up to 400 mg for 14 days and then entospletinib up to 400 mg in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine for up to two 14-day cycles.
Dose Expansion: Entospletinib 400 mg for 14 days and then entospletinib 400 mg in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine for up to two 14-day cycles. Some participants will have the option to receive post-induction therapy with entospletinib 400 mg in combination with cytarabine/cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). If participant remains to have minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive marrow at the completion of 4 cycles of post-induction therapy, participants may receive maintenance therapy with 28-day cycles of entospletinib 400 mg for up to twelve 28-day cycles, if the participant is not eligible for stem cell transplant.</description>

    <description>Dose Escalation: Entospletinib 400 mg for 14 days and then entospletinib 400 mg in combination with decitabine for 10 days beginning on Day 1 of every 28-day cycle (at least 2 cycles of induction therapy but no more than 4 cycles). Participants who are intolerant of decitabine may switch to entospletinib monotherapy maintenance at any time after completing the first 2 cycles.
Dose Expansion: Entospletinib 400 mg for 14 days and then entospletinib 400 mg in combination with decitabine or azacitidine (at least 2 cycles of induction therapy but no more than 4 cycles). Some participants will have the option to receive maintenance therapy with entospletinib in combination with decitabine or azacitidine. Participants who are intolerant of decitabine or azacitidine may switch to entospletinib monotherapy maintenance at any time after completing the first 2 cycles.</description>

Dose Expansion: Entospletinib 400 mg for 28-day cycles until the participant meets criteria for study treatment discontinuation per the protocol. Some participants may receive entospletinib in combination with 1 cycle of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) for 28-day cycles until the participant meets criteria for study treatment discontinuation per the protocol.</description>
