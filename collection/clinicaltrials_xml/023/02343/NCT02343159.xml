      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether a MEMS速 cap with a LCD reader (a
      &quot;smart&quot; cap) along with additional patient counseling intervention (Arm 3) can improve
      adherence to dimethyl fumarate (DMF) treatment in MS patients as compared to a MEMS
      (Medication Event Monitoring System) cap without a LCD reader (a &quot;standard&quot; cap) and no
      patient counseling intervention (standard of care, Arm 1) at Month 12.

      The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are: To determine if data
      display on a smart MEMS cap with a LCD reader (Arm 2) can improve adherence as compared to a
      standard MEMS cap without a LCD reader (Arm 1) at Month 12; To determine whether the
      addition of patient counseling intervention based on MEMS data (Arm 3), or data display from
      a MEMS cap with LCD reader (Arm 2) can improve adherence compared to standard MEMS cap
      without a LCD reader (Arm 1) at Month 6; To assess persistence and compliance at Months 6
      and 12 for all arms; To assess the association between adherence and patient reported
      outcomes (PROs) for all arms including Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and the
      Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI): MS v2.0.

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measurements for Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29 score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) is a patient-reported outcome measure to assess the impact of MS on day-to-day life during the past 2 weeks from a patient's perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items. The physical score is generated by summing individual items and then transforming to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where high scores indicate worse health.</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measurements for Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI: MS v2.0 score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
