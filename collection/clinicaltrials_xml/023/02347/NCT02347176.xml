  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Total Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>EASI evaluates 4 natural anatomical regions for severity and extent of key disease signs and focuses on the key acute and chronic signs of inflammation (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification). The maximum total score is 72, with higher values indicating more severe disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Response of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) and at Least a 2-Grade Reduction From Baseline at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA allows investigators to assess overall disease severity at one given time point and consists of a 6-point severity scale from clear to very severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease, and 5 = very severe disease). A participant has IGA response if they achieve a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and at least a 2-grade reduction from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Study Drug Administration to Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of investigational product or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug until Week 22. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening situation (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant who received Tralokinumab. Treatment-emergent adverse events between administration of investigational product and Week 22 that are absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Vital Signs and Physical Examination Abnormalities Reported as Treatment Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From Study Drug Administration to Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>Vital sign parameters are included blood pressure, temperature, pulse rate, and respiratory rate. TEAEs are present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug until Week 22.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Reported as Treatment Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From Study Drug Administration to Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>An abnormal laboratory finding which required an action or intervention by the investigator, or a finding judged by the investigator to represent a change beyond the range of normal physiologic fluctuation are to be reported as an adverse event. Treatment-emergent adverse events between first dose of study drug and 10 weeks after the last dose that are absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Laboratory evaluations (haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis) of blood and urine samples are to be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Electrocardiogram (ECG) Abnormalities Reported as Treatment Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From Study Drug Administration to Week 22</time_frame>
    <description>AEs observed in participants with clinically significant ECG abnormalities are assessed. ECG parameters included heart rate, RR, PR, QRS and QT intervals. Treatment-emergent adverse events between administration of investigational product and Week 22 that are absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 50 percent (%) Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>EASI50 responder is defined as a participant who achieves at least a 50% reduction in EASI score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SCORAD is a clinical tool for assessing the severity (that is, extent, intensity) of AD. The tool evaluates the extent and intensity of the AD lesions, along with participant symptoms. The maximum total score is 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 50 percent (%) Reduction From Baseline in SCORAD at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>SCORAD50 responder is defined as a participant who achieves at least a 50% reduction in SCORAD score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (7-day mean score) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus will be assessed using an NRS (0 - 10) with 0= no itch and 10= worst imaginable itch. Daily pruritus assessments will be summarized as weekly peak score and a change from baseline in weekly peak score will be calculated.</description>
