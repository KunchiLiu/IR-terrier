  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will test the effectiveness of a multi-modal behavioral intervention (the
      Oral Health 4 Life program) targeted to smokers who are ready to quit smoking and seeking
      services through tobacco quitlines.

      The investigators hypothesize that, compared to people in the control arm, participants in
      the enhanced intervention will:

        1. Be more likely to quit smoking as evidenced by 7 day point prevalent abstinence rates
           at 6 month follow-up [primary outcome] and at 2 month follow-up [secondary outcome].

        2. Be more likely to see a dental care professional in the past 6 months at 6 month
           follow-up [primary outcome] or at least be more likely to have scheduled a future
           appointment [secondary outcome].

        3. Exhibit more positive change in relevant oral health knowledge/beliefs and attitudes
           (e.g., self-efficacy, motivation) that could influence future behavior change.

      Smokers (n = 722; 10 pilot participants and 712 main trial participants) will be recruited
      when they call to enroll in services with their state-supported tobacco quitline program.
      Eligible smokers who provide consent and complete the baseline assessment will be randomized
      to either usual care quitline intervention plus attention-matched text messaging or an
      enhanced program which integrates standard tobacco cessation counseling with a multi-modal,
      behavioral oral health promotion program.

      Follow-up assessments will be conducted by phone at 2 and 6 months post-enrollment. In
      addition to examing primary and secondary outcomes of interest (focused on tobacco cessation
      and utilization of professional dental care), change in potentially relevant intermediate
      process measures and the incremental cost of delivering the Oral Health 4 Life program will
      be examined.
