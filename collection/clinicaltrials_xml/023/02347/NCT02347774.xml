      This is a trial of 12 weeks of treatment with nebulized SUN-101 using an Investigational
      eFlow® Closed System (CS) nebulizer in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2014)
      guidelines.

      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      multicenter, efficacy and safety trial of 12 weeks of treatment with nebulized SUN-101 using
      an Investigational eFlow® Closed System (CS) nebulizer in approximately 645 subjects with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic
      Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2014) guidelines.

      SUN-101 or placebo will be administered twice daily as an oral inhalation using the
      investigational eFlow CS nebulizer.

             least 1 pack/day for 10 years, or equivalent)

          4. Post-bronchodilator (following inhalation of ipratropium bromide) FEV1 &lt; 80% of
             predicted normal and &gt; 0.7 L during Screening (Visit 1)

          5. Post-bronchodilator (following inhalation of ipratropium bromide) FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;
             0.70 during Screening (Visit 1)

          6. Ability to perform reproducible spirometry according to the American Thoracic Society
             (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines (2005)

          7. Subject, if female ≤ 65 years of age and of child bearing potential, must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test at Visit 1. Females of childbearing potential must be

             acceptable method of birth control: a) an oral contraceptive, an intrauterine device
             (IUD), implantable contraceptive, transdermal or injectable contraceptive for at
             least 1 month prior to entering the study with continued use throughout the study and
             for thirty days following participation; b) barrier method of contraception, eg,
             condom and /or diaphragm with spermicide while participating in the study; and/or c)

             medical conditions that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude the
             subject from safely completing the required tests or the study, or is likely to
             result in disease progression that would require withdrawal of the subject

          2. Concomitant clinically significant respiratory disease other than COPD (eg, asthma,
             tuberculosis, bronchiectasis or other non-specific pulmonary disease).

          3. Recent history of COPD exacerbation requiring hospitalization or need for increased
             treatments for COPD within 6 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1).

             history of long QT syndrome

          9. History of or clinically significant on-going bladder outflow obstruction or history
             of catheterization for relief of bladder outflow obstruction within the previous 6

         10. History of narrow angle glaucoma

         11. History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to aerosol medications

         12. Recent documented history (within the previous 3 months) of substance abuse

         13. Significant psychiatric disease that would likely result in the subject not being
             able to complete the study, in the opinion of the Investigator

         14. Participation in another investigational drug study where drug was received within 30
             days prior to Screening (Visit 1) or current participation in another investigational
             drug trial, including a SUN-101 study

         15. Previously received SUN-101 (active treatment; formerly known as EP-101)

         16. Contraindicated for treatment with, or having a history of reactions/hypersensitivity
