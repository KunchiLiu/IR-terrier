      This is a trial of 12 weeks of treatment with nebulized SUN-101 using an Investigational
      eFlow® Closed System (CS) nebulizer in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2014)
      guidelines.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      multicenter, efficacy and safety trial of 12 weeks of treatment with nebulized SUN-101 using
      an Investigational eFlow® Closed System (CS) nebulizer in approximately 645 subjects with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic
      Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2014) guidelines.

      SUN-101 or placebo will be administered twice daily as an oral inhalation using the
      investigational eFlow CS nebulizer. Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in the
      substudy (at selected sites only). These subjects will be required to participate in serial
      spirometry, vital signs, ECGs, and an additional Holter monitor assessment at Visit 6 (Week
      12). This subset of subjects will be referred to as the Substudy Population.

          4. Post-bronchodilator (following inhalation of ipratropium bromide) FEV1 &lt; 80% of
             predicted normal and &gt; 0.7 L during Screening (Visit 1)
