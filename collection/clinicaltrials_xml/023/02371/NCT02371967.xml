  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of Erivedge® in patients with
      advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Gorlin syndrome. This prospective, observational,
      cohort study is designed to assess the effectiveness and safety outcomes of Erivedge® and to
      assess actual day-to-day disease and patient management by the physician.
