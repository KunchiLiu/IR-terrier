    <textblock>
      Depression during pregnancy is prevalent (15-20%) and has an adverse impact on fetal
      outcomes including preterm delivery (PTD) and low birthweight (LBW). Currently, significant
      confusion exists about if and how depression during pregnancy should be treated, given the
      unknown risk-benefit profiles of various treatments. We propose to conduct a two-stage
      prospective cohort study to determine if treating depression in pregnancy is effective in
      improving fetal outcomes, and which treatment is most effective: pharmacotherapy,
      psychotherapy or a combination. The risk-benefit of the treatments will be examined
      separately for two depression types: pregnant women with depression only and those with
      other psychiatric comorbidities to evaluate possible differences in treatment effectiveness
      between the two groups. Findings will provide answers to long standing stakeholder questions
      of how to treat depression in pregnancy and which treatment is most effective with the best
      risk-benefit profile in improving fetal outcomes. Selecting an effective treatment could
      reduce PTD or LBW, thus, reducing infant mortality and morbidity, and medical costs.

      Depression during pregnancy is prevalent (15-20%) and has an adverse impact on fetal
      outcomes including preterm delivery (PTD) and low birthweight (LBW). Currently, significant
      confusion exists about if and how depression during pregnancy should be treated, given the
      unknown risk-benefit profiles of various treatments. Kaiser Permanente Northern California
      has implemented a large scale universal peripartum depression screening program, annually
      screening more than 35,000 pregnant women. Taking advantage of this unique infrastructure,
      we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study to determine if treating
      depression in pregnancy is effective in improving fetal outcomes, and which treatment is
      most effective: pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy or a combination. The risk-benefit of the
      treatments will be examined separately for two depression types: pregnant women with
      depression only and those with other psychiatric comorbidities to evaluate possible
      differences in treatment effectiveness between the two groups. Stakeholders (patients,
      advocacy groups, and providers) are an integral part of the research team. Four cohorts with
      different treatment options including untreated will be formed within each depression type
      (with or without comorbidity): (A) &quot;Antidepressant only&quot;: screen positive for depression and
      use only antidepressants during pregnancy; (B) &quot;Psychotherapy only&quot;: screen positive and
      receive psychotherapy only; (C) &quot;Combination therapy&quot;: screen positive and receive both
      antidepressants and psychotherapy; (D)&quot;Untreated depression&quot;: screen positive and receive no
      treatment. A total of eight cohorts will be formed. A final cohort (E) &quot;No depression&quot;:
      screen negative and receive no treatment, will be examined for baseline comparison.
      Information on depression treatment and PTD and LBW will be available for all participating
      women who will be followed until the end of pregnancy. Within each depression category,
      comparison of Cohort A, B &amp; C to D, respectively, will determine if treating depression is
      effective. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts A, B &amp; C will determine the comparative
      effectiveness of treatment regimens. Comparison of Cohort D to E provides baseline fetal
      risks of untreated depression. Findings will provide answers to long standing stakeholder
      questions of how to treat depression in pregnancy and which treatment is most effective with
      the best risk-benefit profile in improving fetal outcomes. Selecting an effective treatment
      could reduce PTD or LBW, thus, reducing infant mortality and morbidity, and medical costs.
