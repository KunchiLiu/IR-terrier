    <textblock>
      An 8 week clinical study to evaluate the ability of an experimental dentifrice containing
      calcium sodium phosphosilicate and sodium fluoride to provide relief from dentine
      hypersensitivity compared to a marketed dentifrice containing calcium sodium phosphosilicate
      and sodium monofluorophosphate.

    <textblock>
      A single centre, multi-site, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment, parallel group,
      non-inferiority design clinical study conducted in healthy subjects with self-reported and
      clinically diagnosed dentine hypersensitivity (DH). This study will compare the
      effectiveness of a test dentifrice containing 5% w/w calcium sodium phosphosilicate and
      fluoride as sodium fluoride to a commercially available dentifrice containing 5% w/w calcium
      sodium phosphosilicate and fluoride as sodium monofluorophosphate, in providing relief from
      DH after 4 and 8 weeks twice daily treatment.

    <measure>Tactile sensitivity measured by Tactile threshold (Yeaple probe) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Upper force setting will be 80g. Testing will begin at 10g and increase by 10g, with each successive challenge, until either a &quot;yes&quot; response is recorded or the maximum force has been reached. The force setting which elicited the &quot;yes&quot; response will be repeated. The gram setting which elicits two consecutive &quot;yes&quot; responses will be recorded as tactile threshold. If a second &quot;yes&quot; is not obtained, the force setting will be increased by 10g and the examiner will continue until a force is found which elicits two consecutive &quot;yes&quot; responses. If no sensitivity is found below the session maximum, the threshold will be recorded as &gt;80g</description>
