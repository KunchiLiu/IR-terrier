      This will be an open label clinical trial with all subjects receiving both lorcaserin and
      varenicline. The investigators will obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of lorcaserin
      (10 mg twice daily) for 12 weeks in 20 adult weight-concerned cigarette smokers with a BMI
      of 27 to 40 simultaneously receiving 12 weeks of open-label varenicline and a behavioral
      intervention to assist with stopping smoking. Secondary aims will be weight, waist
      circumference, and smoking cessation.
