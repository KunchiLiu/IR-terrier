    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a Phase IV, single center, placebo-controlled, parallel study design
      conducted using the Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU). The study will aim to be determine
      whether there are any benefits from Grastek® for the treatment of birch-pollen induced
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Grastek® is a Health Canada and FDA approved sublingual
      immunotherapy (SLIT) for the treatment of grass-pollen induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.
      The EEU provides a closed environment in which participants are exposed to a predetermined,
      controlled, constant level of airborne pollen. 96 participants will complete this study and
      will either receive Grastek® or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The study will consist of a
      screening visit, a pre-treatment pollen exposure visit, 60 days of treatment with Grastek®
      or placebo, two treatment visits and a follow-up pollen exposure visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant demonstrates understanding and has provided an appropriately signed and
             dated informed consent.

          2. Male or Female, 18 to 65 years of age, at time of the Screening visit.

          3. Participant has a history of at least moderate allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to
             hypersensitivity to birch pollen for a minimum of 2 years.

          4. Participant responds to the birch pollen and timothy grass pollen through a standard
             skin prick test administered at the Screening visit. A positive test will be defined
             as a wheal diameter at least 5mm or larger than the negative control (normal saline)
             wheal. A historical skin-prick test performed within three-hundred sixty-five (365)
             days or one (1) year at the site will be accepted in lieu of performing a new skin
             prick test.

          5. Participant understands and is willing, able and likely to comply with study
             procedures and restrictions.

          6. Participant, if female, has a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 and is willing
             to use a medically acceptable form of birth control. Acceptable methods of birth
             control for this study include:

               -  oral, patch, or intra-vaginal hormonal contraceptives

             surgical history or presence of other respiratory disease (exceptions made for asthma
             and allergic rhinitis as defined in further exclusion criteria), or gastrointestinal,
             renal, hepatic, hematological, lymphatic, neurological, cardiovascular, psychiatric,

             disorders, or a history of malignancy within the past 5 years, with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer.

          4. Has any significant abnormalities found during physical exam as determined by the

             short acting beta-agonist less than 3 times per week). Isolated exercise-induced
             bronchospasm is also permitted.

          6. Has received an investigational drug within the last thirty (30) days.

          7. Has had use of immunotherapy containing grass or birch within the last 3 years.

          9. Administration of adrenaline (epinephrine) is contraindicated (e.g. participants with
             acute or chronic symptomatic coronary heart disease or concomitant beta-blocker
             therapy).

         10. Is unlikely to cooperate with the requirements of the study including having the
             ability to communicate with the investigator appropriately.
