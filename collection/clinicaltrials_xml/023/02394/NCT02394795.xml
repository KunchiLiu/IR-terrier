      The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination
      therapy and mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab combination therapy in first-line treatment of
      chemotherapy-naive patients with KRAS/NRAS wild-type, incurable/unresectable,

      The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy of mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination
      therapy and mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab combination therapy in first-line treatment of
      chemotherapy-naive patients with KRAS/NRAS wild-type, incurable/unresectable,
      advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer.

      This study will enroll a total of 800 participants (400 per group). Patients will be
      randomized to either the mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab arm (Group P) or mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab arm
      (Group B) at 1:1 ratio at the time of registration.

      Group P and Group B treatment regimen shown below should be administered once every two
      weeks, following dose, schedule and route of administration.

      Group P; mFOLFOX6 + panitumumab combination therapy, once every two weeks OXA: 85 mg/m2/day
      1 LV: 200 mg/m2/day 15-FU iv: 400 mg/m2/day 1 5-FU civ: 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3 panitumumab: 6
      mg/kg

      Group B; mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab combination therapy, once every two weeks OXA: 85 mg/m2/day
      1 LV: 200 mg/m2/day 1 5-FU iv: 400 mg/m2/day 1 5-FU civ: 2400 mg/m2/day 1-3 bevacizumab: 5
      mg/kg/

      This trial is conducted by multicenter and is scheduled for 12 months as whole
      administration period. As an additional study of the main study to investigate biomarkers
      exploratory which may be predictors of Panitumumab and Bevacizumab efficacy, using tumor
      issue and blood sample before treatment.
