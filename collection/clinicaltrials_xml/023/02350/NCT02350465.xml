  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to: 1) validate a rapid, portable, cost-effective method
      for screening myosteatosis and sarcopenia using diagnostic ultrasound, and 2) investigate a
      novel approach to progressive resistance exercise involving eccentric muscle actions that
      will counter the local effects of myosteatosis and sarcopenia in African Americans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is the need to proactively address health disparities
      associated with age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction. Age-related changes in muscle may
      be characterized by sarcopenia (i.e., loss of muscle mass) and/or myosteatosis (i.e.,
      excessive intramuscular adipose tissue). These changes may result in physical impairments
      that may be exacerbated by the lack of a formal screening and diagnosis process for older
      adults in standard healthcare settings. Myosteatosis may compound the effects of sarcopenia
      and play a significant role the age-related functional decline and higher incidence of type
      2 diabetes observed in African Americans in comparison to other ethnic/racial groups. The
      initial phase of the study will involve the assessment of older African Americans (n = 70)
      to characterize muscle size and quality in comparison to a younger reference group (n = 70).
      Participants randomly selected from the older subject pool will be assigned to either the
      Eccentric Exercise Group or the Concentric Exercise Group for 12 weeks of a supervised
      strengthening exercise regimen.
