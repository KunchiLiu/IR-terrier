      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized double-arm pilot trial.

      Patients with acute ischemic stroke who meet inclusion criteria would be followed up for 90
      days upon enrollment. There will be 150 intervention patients enrolled. Patients who agree
      to participate in observation but refuse intervention for various reasons will be assigned
      to the medical arm. The main reason for refusal to intervention is expected to be financial,
      as the cost of the intervention devices far exceeds that of hospitalization and
      pharmaceutical agents in China. Not all patients can afford or are under insurance that pay
      for these devices. We expect two thirds of the patients who agree to participate in this
      study will refuse intervention. These patients are expected to be similar in demographics to
      the intervention patients. Although patient selection bias is inevitable with this design,
      we believe this design is appropriate for a pilot study and is critical to provide the
      missing natural history data in Chinese population for future trial design.

      The intervention patients will be treated for mechanical recanalization with Solitaire
      within 12 hours after stroke onset plus standard medical therapy. The medical arm will be
      treated with standard medical therapy alone. During the trial, multiple indicators will be
      assessed in all patients at baseline, 24hours,14days(or at discharge, whichever occurs
      first)and 90 days. Primary efficacy endpoint will be functional independence as defined by
      modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤ 2 at 90 days or function improvement by mRS shift
      analysis.Primary procedure efficacy endpoint will be arterial recanalization of the occluded
      target vessel measured by Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score equal or superior
      to 2b right following the use of the Study Device. Primary safety endpoint is systematicICH
      with 24 ±3hrs post procedure.The secondary endpoints include: rate of device-related and
      procedure related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) at 14 days or discharge; volume of cerebral
      infarction as measured by a CT scan at 24 ±3hrs post procedure; arterial reperfusion
      measured by reperfusion ratio on CT scan 24 ±3hrs post procedure; infarction in subjects who
      achieved TICI 2b‐3 reperfusion without intracranial hemorrhage;death due to any cause at
      14days or discharge and at 90 days; change in NIHSSat 24±3hrs post procedure;change in NIHSS
      at 14 days or discharge post procedure; change in NIHSSat 90 ± 7days; quality of life at 90±
      7days; the proportion of patients who suffer a Safety Outcome : the proportion of patients
      with the composite of: (i) symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ii) major bleeding due to
      femoral artery access complications including groin hematoma, retroperitoneal hematoma (iii)
      contrast nephropathy;economic (cost-effectiveness) analysis;evaluation of waiver/deferral of
      consent process; the total radiation dose (CT, CTA, angiography) reported as a continuous
      measure;the proportion of patients with malignant MCA infarction;the proportion of patients
      undergoing hemicraniectomy.

      Because a substantial number of patients in the intervention group are expected to have
      intracranial atherosclerosis, subgroup analysis will also be carried out on this group of
      patient. The clinical outcomes, the final TICI score after angioplasty and possible
      stenting, and symptomatic ICH (including SAH) and immediate re-thrombosis rate will be
      included in the subgroup analysis.
