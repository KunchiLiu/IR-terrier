  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a study drug called patritumab. Patritumab may work
      when combined with other medications that are approved in the UK for treating Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN), called cetuximab, cisplatin or carboplatin. It is
      hoped that patritumab may have some benefit in treating patients with cancer. This study
      will help identify how much patritumab can be given in combination with cetuximab, and
      cisplatin or carboplatin. This study will also show how safe and how well tolerated
      patritumab is when these medications are given together.
