  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, antiviral efficacy, and pharmacokinetics
      of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) administered for 4 weeks in
      adults with genotype 1 or 4 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are undergoing primary
      liver transplantation.
