      This study is embedded in a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) (ClinicalTrials.gov ID:
      NCT02337101) from which the subjects are recruited and will separately examine the possible
      microstructural changes in the brain during recovery after mild traumatic brain injury
      (mTBI) in subjects with ongoing symptoms more than 2 month after mTBI in both groups from
      the RCT.

      Several biomarkers and brain areas has been investigated as possible sites of injury after
      mTBI. The nature of the diffuse chronic post-concussion symptoms (PCS) makes corpus callosum
      (CC), thalamus (THA) and hippocampus (HIP) interesting because of their central position and
      connection to widespread motor, sensory and cognitive processes and other brain areas. In
      most prior studies conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has failed to detect
      pathology especially in the chronic phase after mTBI. Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) and
      Diffusional Tensor Imaging (DTI) are more sensitive to microstructural changes and might
      serve as biomarkers in the brain after mTBI.

      We hypothesized that a change in symptoms (as measured by cognitive performance and self
      reported symptoms) will correlate with a change in microstructural changes (as measured with
      DKI) in thalamus, corpus callosum and hippocampus from baseline 2-6 month after mTBI to
      follow up 6 month after.

      Separate correlations will also be made for both treatment and control group within the
      cohort.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Concussion caused by a head trauma according to the diagnostic criteria recommended
             by the Danish Consensus Report on Commotio Cerebri within the last 2-6 months. The
             criteria are based on recommendations by the WHO Task Force, but with the amendment,
             that there must have been a direct contact between the head and an object in order to
             rule out pure acceleration - deceleration traumas.

          -  Age 18 to 30 years at the time of the head trauma.

          -  Able to understand, speak and read Danish.

          -  Patients with symptoms on at least three items on the Rivermead Post Concussion
             Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) rated as moderate or severe problem. PCS have to be
             subjectively rated as causing substantial impairment in daily life.

          -  Suitable for MRI examination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Objective neurological findings from neurological examination and / or acute trauma
             CT scan, indicating other neurological diseases or brain damage.

          -  Previous concussion leading to persistent PCS within the last two years.

          -  Severe abuse of alcohol, prescription drugs and / or illegal drugs.

          -  Psychiatric morbidity or severe neurological disease that impedes participation in
             the treatment, i.e. Bipolar Disorder, autism, psychotic disorder (lifetime), multiple
             sclerosis etc.
