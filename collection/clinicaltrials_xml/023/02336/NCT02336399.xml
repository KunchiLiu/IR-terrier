    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a serious liver disease worldwide, and the leading cause of
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).HBsAg loss/seroconversion is considered to be
      the ideal endpoint of antiviral therapy in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients, and
      the ultimate treatment goal in CHB. However, some patients achieved HBsAg loss would reverse
      back to HBsAg positive, even occur HBV reactive. in this study, the viral and HBsAg response
      in patients achieved HBsAg loss by interferon treatment will be observed for two years after
      completed IFN treatment.

      The patients with chronic hepatitis B and achieved HBsAg loss by interferon treatment will
      be enrolled and observed for 96 weeks. Serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe
      will be measured every 3 months during the observation period, liver function tests were
      performed every 3 months also. The liver ultrasonic examination would be taken every 3-6
      months. The primary endpoint is HBsAg reverse back to positive. The secondary endpoints is
      HBV DNA reaction.

    <description>The serum HBsAg level will be tested every 3 month for 96 weeks after completed treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B and achieved HBsAg loss by interferon treatment. The rates of sustained HBsAg and viral response defined HBsAg level maintained below the low limited value and undetectable HBV DNA load will be evaluated.</description>

        the study population in this study were composed of patients who had chronic hepatitis B
        and achieved HBsAg loss by interferon treatment, and serum HBsAg and HBV DNA would be
        tested every 3 months for 96 weeks after finished treatment.the sustained HBsAg response
        defined serum HBsAg mantaining below the low limited value would be evalued during the
        observation periad.
