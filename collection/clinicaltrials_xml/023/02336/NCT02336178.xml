      The purpose of this post-approval study is to provide supplementary information relating to
      the use of BeneFIX in Chinese subjects with hemophilia B, especially on the safety and
      efficacy in different populations of Chinese hemophilia B patients, in particular in
      pediatric patients &lt;6 years of age, pediatric patients ≥6 to ≤12 years of age, Previously
      Untreated Patients (PUPs) , subjects receiving prophylaxis treatment after enrollment in the
      study, and severe patients (FIX activity &lt;1%).
