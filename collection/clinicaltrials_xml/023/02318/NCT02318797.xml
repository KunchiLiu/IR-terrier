    <textblock>
      Adults with serious mental illness (SMI) frequently have unmet medical needs which place
      them at risk for adverse health outcomes. While there are proven ways to manage and/or
      prevent serious medical conditions common among this population, information is needed to
      understand their impact on outcomes that matter most for patients, particularly in community
      mental health centers (CMHCs) where most adults with SMI receive their care and rural areas
      where locating and receiving health care services can be challenging.

      The investigators will test two promising ways for promoting the health, wellness, and
      recovery of adults with SMI. One way will help patients manage their health and health care
      through self-management strategies, including the use of a web portal, and peer support
      (patient self-directed care) and the other through interactions with nurses during clinic
      visits (provider-supported integrated care).

      The investigators will compare the two interventions on three primary patient-centered
      outcomes (i.e. patient activation in care, health status, engagement in primary/specialty
      care). The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. Patient self-directed care will result in improvement in patient activation.

        2. Provider-supported integrated care will result in greater improvement in frequency in
           primary/specialty care visits.

        3. Both interventions will result in significant improvements in the three primary
           outcomes.

      The investigators will collect information from patients, caregivers, and clinic staff at
      different points in time during the study. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires
      and additional data on their service use will be gathered. Some patients and providers will
      also be interviewed about their experiences with care. The investigators will examine these
      data to learn if, how, and why the new services improve outcomes over time. This information
      will help us understand patient and other stakeholder views about the services and, if
      appropriate, ensure their continued and/or expanded availability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of high medical need with difficulty accessing quality medical care makes
      adults with serious mental illness (SMI) one of our nation's most medically vulnerable
      populations. While evidence-based interventions exist for managing and/or preventing high
      rates of chronic medical conditions in this population, information is needed to understand
      their impact on outcomes that matter most for patients, particularly in community mental
      health centers (CMHCs) where most adults with SMI receive their care and rural areas where
      availability of and access to health care services is limited.

      Building on the work of a multi-stakeholder collaboration in rural Pennsylvania, the UPMC
      Center for High-Value Health Care and our patient, provider, and payer partners will
      evaluate two promising interventions—patient self-directed care and provider-supported
      integrated care—for promoting the health, wellness, and recovery of adults with SMI. We will
      address four questions that patients have identified as important to them:

        1. Given my mental and physical conditions, what should I expect will happen to my overall
           health, wellness, and recovery when I engage in the new services offered by my CMHC?

        2. If I choose to participate in these services, what are the potential advantages or
           disadvantages to me?

        3. In what ways can I become more active in managing my own health and health care?

        4. Which of the services that my CMHC could make available to me will impact outcomes that
           I care about and help me make the best decisions about my health and care? Our aims
           compare the effectiveness of the interventions on patient-centered outcomes and explore
           the moderating role of patient characteristics and the mediating role of engagement in
           the interventions. By demonstrating which interventions improve outcomes for whom under
           what circumstances, we will inform positive patient heath choices and key stakeholder
           decision making to support these choices, thereby advancing health system improvement
           efforts to avoid early mortality and comorbidity in this population.

      We have enrolled 1,229 Medicaid-enrolled adults who have or are at risk for chronic medical
      conditions and receive care at rural and suburban CMHCs. Using a cluster randomized design
      with a mixed-methods approach, we randomly assigned 11 CMHCs to one of the two
      interventions. Quantitative (self-report, claims, process) and qualitative (interviews) data
      will be gathered across multiple time points from baseline through the end of the two-year
      intervention. Descriptive and multivariate analyses will be used to examine the impact of
      the interventions on outcomes over time and explore the roles of moderating and mediating
      variables. Qualitative results will be used to understand patient and other stakeholder
      perspectives and promote dissemination and sustainability.

    <description>Assessed using the PAM, a 13-item scale that renders a total activation score. This measure gauges the knowledge, skills, and confidence of patients essential to managing their own health and health care. It divides into progressively higher levels of activation: starting to take a role, building knowledge and confidences, taking action, and maintaining behaviors.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and every 6 months over 2 year active intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Patient hopefulness will be assessed using the Hope Scale, an instrument designed to measure hope that has been previously used in health services research. Twelve items are rated on a four-point response scale ranging from &quot;definitely false&quot; to &quot;definitely true&quot; and summed to produce a total score. Research has found Hope Scale scores to be positively associated with goal-related activities and coping strategies.</description>
