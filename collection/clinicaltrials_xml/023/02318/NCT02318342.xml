  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study designed to evaluate the structural and functional integrity of
      transcatheter or surgical bioprosthetic valves with multimodality imaging. The study further
      aims to confirm resolution of the early bioprosthetic valve thrombotic changes with Vitamin
      K antagonists (warfarin) mediated anticoagulation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a history of SAVR or TAVR with bioprosthetic aortic valves undergo cardiac
      contrast CT imaging and transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate structural and functional
      integrity of the aortic valves. The imaging studies will be performed at least 48-hours
      after TAVR/SAVR. Patients with prosthetic valve abnormalities suggestive of thrombus will be
      administered anticoagulation therapy with Vitamin K antagonists (Warfarin) for 3 months with
      goal International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2-3, followed by repeat contrast CT of the chest
      and transthoracic imaging. Repeat imaging following 3 months of anticoagulation therapy is
      performed to evaluate the response to anticoagulation therapy. INR levels will be monitored
      and warfarin dose adjusted to maintain target INR 2-3.
