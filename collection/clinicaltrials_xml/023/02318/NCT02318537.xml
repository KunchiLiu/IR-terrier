  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 trial will enroll participants diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) who
      are still experiencing at least 4 motor seizures involving the trunk or extremities per
      week, despite ongoing treatment with up to 3 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Following a 28-day baseline period, participants will begin an 84-day treatment period.
      Participants will be assigned to receive twice daily doses of placebo or cannabidiol oral
      solution at the highest dose determined to be safe in a previous trial.

      Following study completion, all participants will be invited to receive Cannabidiol Oral
      Solution in an open label extension study (under a separate protocol).
