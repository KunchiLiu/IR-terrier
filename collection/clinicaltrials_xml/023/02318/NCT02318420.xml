      OVERALL OBJECTIVE In an East African referral hospital, to analyze the effect on quality of
      intrapartum care when implementing first locally agreed and achievable guidelines and a
      continual in-house training program and later on converting the guidelines to an eHealth
      solution for strengthening partogram-based monitoring-to-action during labour.

      INTERVENTIONS 1. WHO paper partograms, locally developed labour management guidelines and
      continual in-house education. 2. A low-tech triage system for intrapartum care, based on the
      locally developed guidelines. 3. An eHealth solution in supportion partogram-associated
      monitoring-to-action during labour.

      OVERALL DESIGN Three intervention-based pre vs. post studies. SETTING Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar.

      POPULATION Labouring women delivering at the study site from October 2014 to April 2017 and
      their offspring, as well as health providers. Women and their offspring will be enrolled
      at/after unset of labour and followed until discharge.

      ENDPOINTS The primary endpoint is perinatal mortality occurring intra-hospital. For
      secondary outcomes, please see below.

      STUDY TIME Data collection from September 2014 to April 2017.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

      I (a) To analyze in depth current quality of intrapartum care by a mixed methods approach,
      including exploration of underlying challenges in care delivery and an association between
      suboptimal labour care and perinatal mortality. (b) To conduct a criterion-based audit of
      stillbirths investigating direct and indirect causes and related maternal risks.

      II. To develop locally achievable and agreed partogram-associated labour
      monitoring-to-action guidelines (the PartoMa guidelines) for strengthening the partogram use
      as a decision support tool, and study its acceptability by skilled birth attendants.

      III. To implement the PartoMa guidelines and low cost, low dose, high frequency, in-house
      training for strengthening the use of the partogram as a decision support tool, and study
      the effect on knowledge, skills, quality of intrapartum care, record keeping, and perinatal
      outcome.

      IV. On top of the PartoMa guidelines and the continual training package, to implement a low
      tech intrapartum triage system based on the PartoMa guidelines' colour codes and study the
      effect on timely intrapartum surveillance and actions during labour.

      V. To develop and evaluate an eHealth solution, based on the interventions above, to assist
      the skilled birth attendants to improve monitoring-to-action during labour.

      VI. To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the interventions studied (specific objectives
      III-V).

      SETTING

      The East African Mnazi Mmoja Hospital (MMH) in Zanzibar is a governmental referral facility
      serving the population of Zanzibar. As East Africa in general, the Zanzibarian archipelago
      struggles with poverty and a resource constraint health system, and half of the population
      live below the basic needs poverty line.

      At the facility's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the yearly number of deliveries
      is approximately 13,000, and the number is rising. During the past four years, approximately
      50 maternal deaths have occurred at the department yearly. In the same period, the yearly
      stillbirth rate show a tendency of increasing. In 2013, 480 stillbirths and an estimated 157
      neonatal deaths occurred at the Department.

      Maternal and perinatal death audits are not conducted routinely and little is known about
      direct and indirect causes for the perinatal deaths.

      METHODS

      This study presents a stepwise quality improvement process of intrapartum monitoring, action
      and triage. The effect of each step is evaluated by continual register-based assessments of
      outcomes, criterion-based audit of intrapartum care, knowledge of staff, and qualitative
      explorations. The overall study design is here presented in relation to the four specific
      objectives:

      I. The intervention-based study is based on an in-depth baseline quality of care assessment,
      which includes the following: a. Maternal death enquiry; b. Criterion-based audit of
      intrapartum management in cases of perinatal deaths compared to cases with Apgar scores of
      7-10; c. Qualitative exploration of contributing causes to substandard labour management
      (including participant observations and in depth interviews).

      II. Together with local doctors and nurse-midwives, international evidence-based guidelines
      are adapted to be locally achievable (the PartoMa guidelines). Additionally, they are
      internationally peer-reviewed with the aim of representing best possible care with the
      limited resources available at the facility.

      III. A concept for continual in-house training in monitoring-to-action during labour is
      developed, based on the PartoMa guidelines and implemented together with the guidelines.

      IV. On top of the PartoMa guidelines and the continual training package, a low tech
      intrapartum triage system is developed together with the local staff, based on the PartoMa
      guidelines' colour codes.

      V. An eHealth solution is developed, based on the interventions above, to improve
      monitoring-to-action during labour.

      VI. A cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention steps is carried out.
