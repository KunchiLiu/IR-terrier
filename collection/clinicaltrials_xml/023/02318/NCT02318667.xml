    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate serum soluble human Suppression of Tumorigenicity 2
      (ST2) protein, the receptor for IL-33 and a member of the proinflammatory IL-1 receptor
      superfamily, as a surrogate biological marker predictive of disease outcome and therapeutic
      response to golimumab treatment in subjects with moderate to severe UC who have failed on
      prior conventional therapies. The primary endpoints of this study are to correlate serum
      soluble ST2 levels with endoscopic activity (endoscopic subscore of the Mayo score) and
      histological activity (Geboes index) of disease.
