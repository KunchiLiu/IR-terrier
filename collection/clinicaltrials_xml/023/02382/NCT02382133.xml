  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring is the standard of care in critically ill patients in
      emergency departments, operating rooms and intensive care units. In patients with poor
      peripheral perfusion (low blood flow) due to peripheral vascular disease, low body
      temperature, or shock and the use of medications to raise the blood pressure, clinicians
      have difficulty obtaining an accurate measurement. This study compares the accuracy of
      forehead oximetry sensors to nasal alar sensors to lab oximetry measures and on the rate of
      device related pressure ulcers with both.

      Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring is the standard of care in critically ill patients in
      emergency departments, operating rooms and intensive care units. In patients with poor
      peripheral perfusion (low blood flow) due to peripheral vascular disease, low body
      temperature, or shock and the use of medications to raise the blood pressure, clinicians
      have difficulty obtaining an accurate measurement. Several studies have demonstrated the
      utility of forehead sensor measurements under these clinical conditions. Forehead sensor
      measurement is considered to be a more central measurement than with digit or ear sensors.
      However the sensor requires a head band for accurate measurement. On a regular basis, the
      forehead sensor has led to pressure ulcer development at Barnes-Jewish Hospital despite
      following vendor recommendations for alternating placement every 8 hours from one side of
      the forehead to the other. An alternate sensor placed on the nose has recently demonstrated
      rapid detection of induced drops in oxygen saturation. It has also demonstrated correlation
      with arterial oxygen saturation measured in a clinical laboratory. The oxygen saturation
      measurement from the nose is also considered a central measurement. However, studies of the
      nose sensor were conducted in healthy subjects or during anesthesia care over several hours.
      Therefore, research is needed to examine the accuracy of the nose sensor in the ICU patient
      population. In addition, due to concerns for sensor related pressure ulcers in patients with
      decreased perfusion, the sensor needs to be evaluated for extended periods of time.
