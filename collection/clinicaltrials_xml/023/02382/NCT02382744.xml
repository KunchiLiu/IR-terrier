    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery have the option of having a nerve block
      administered by their Anesthesiologist. The nerve block numbs the foot and results in less
      post-operative nausea and vomiting, and better pain control. Two different techniques for
      blocking the saphenous nerve to the foot have been described and are both commonly used at
      St. Paul's hospital. The goal of this study is to compare the success rates of these two
      techniques.

      Purpose / Hypothesis This clinical study is a prospective, controlled, randomized,
      single-blinded trial designed to investigate the hypothesis that ultrasound-guided blockade
      of the saphenous nerve in conjunction with nerve stimulation has a higher success rate when
      compared to ultrasound alone. These research interventions represent what is considered to
      be an improvement on the standard practice at St. Paul's, which is to block the saphenous
      nerve with one of any number of saphenous nerve blocks, using a number of different
      techniques (i.e. ultrasound-guided, nerve stimulation, blind field block); the effectiveness
      of which has been inconsistent. The purpose of this study is to identify if one technique
      has a great success rate over another, which would ultimately result in increased success
      rates of saphenous nerve blocks and patient care.

      Study Design The study will be a randomized, single-blinded trial of 80 subjects who are
      undergoing foot and ankle surgery. Informed consent will be obtained from all study
      subjects. Subjects will be randomized to one of two saphenous nerve block techniques to be
      administered by an experienced regional anesthesiologist at St. Paul's Hospital. Once the
      nerve block is completed the success will be evaluated by an investigator blinded to the
      procedure. Once the 30min evaluation is completed anesthetic care will be provided according
      to regular institutional practice and at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist.
      The subject will then be contacted at 2 and 7 days after block administration to assess for
      delayed complications.

      Intravenous access will be gained and non-invasive blood pressure measurements will be
      recorded every five minutes. Continuous electrocardiography and oxygen saturation monitoring
      will be maintained throughout the procedure and for at least 60 minutes afterwards. Light
      sedation will be provided, with the goal of maintaining verbal contact with the subject
      throughout the procedure. Where clinically appropriate, the study block may be preceded by
      an ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic nerve block at the discretion of the attending
      anesthesiologist.

      Saphenous nerve blockade will be preformed using a transsartorial approach. Subjects in both
      groups will be positioned prone. The ultrasound probe will be placed in the transverse plane
      on the medial aspect of the thigh 3-5cm cephalad to the superior border of the patella (area
      marked). An attempt will then be made to identify the saphenous nerve, which runs deep to
      the sartorius muscle within the subsartorial fascial plane. The nerve will appear
      hyperechoic, round or oval shaped. The anesthesiologist will have a maximum scan time of 3
      minutes prior to needle entry. Up to 5 mL of 1% Lidocaine will be used for skin infiltration
      of the injection site. The block will then be preformed as to the protocols below depending
      on group allocation. A thirty minute evaluation of the saphenous nerve block will occur
      during the normal monitoring period after the placement of a block.

      Following completion of the thirty-minute evaluation, anesthetic care will be provided
      according to regular institutional practice and at the discretion of the attending
      anesthesiologist. This may include spinal or general anesthesia.

      All subjects will be contacted by telephone at two and seven days post procedure for a
      follow up interview to assess for delayed complications associated with the procedure.

      The medications used for the nerve blocks in the study will include only ropivacaine 0.5%
      and lidocaine 1%. For subject sedation, midazolam and fentanyl will be used. None of these
      medications are considered study drugs; rather they are commonly used anesthetic
      medications. While used in the study, these drugs themselves are not being investigated. The
      same medications will be used on subjects not enrolled in the study.

      Study Treatment Group 1 - Saphenous nerve block using ultrasound guidance The needle will be
      placed with the needle tip in close proximity (1-2 mm) of the target structures (the
      saphenous nerve if visible or in the subsartorial facial plane of the sartorius muscle if
      the nerve is not visible). A total of 10 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine will be used for the block.
      Before injection of any local anesthetic a gentle aspiration will be preformed, with a
      second aspiration after 5 mL of ropivacaine has been injected. Once injection of local
      anesthetic has commenced small needle adjustments are allowed to enhance spread. This will
      be done at the discretion of the regional anesthesiologist performing the block.

      Study Treatment Group 2 - Saphenous nerve blockade using ultrasound guidance and nerve
      stimulation The needle will be place with the needle tip in close proximity (1-2 mm) of the
      target structure (the saphenous nerve if visible or in the subsartorial fascial plane if the
      nerve is not visible). The Pajunk MultiStim SENSOR nerve stimulator will then be turned on,
      starting at 1.0 milliamp (mA) until a tapping sensation is elicited in the medial or
      anterior aspect of the ankle. The amplitude of the nerve stimulator will then be gradually
      decreased with maintenance of the tapping sensation by making small adjustments in needle
      location. The end-point for nerve localization will be a tapping sensation in the area of
      the medial malleolus at ≤ 0.6 mA. The anesthesiologist will have a maximum search time of 5
      minutes from needle entry to elicitation of the tapping sensation. Once a tapping sensation
      is elicited in the ≤ 0.6 mA range, 10 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine will be injected at the site.
      If a tapping sensation is elicited but not ≤ 0.6 mA within 5 minutes then 10 mL of 0.5%
      ropivacaine will be injected at the site where the lowest amplitude tapping sensation was
      elicited. If no tapping sensation is elicited from the subject after 5 minutes, an injection
      of 10 mL of ropivacaine will be made below the Sartorius muscle in the subsartorial fascial
      plane. Before injection of any local anesthetic a gentle aspiration will be preformed, with
      a second aspiration after 5 mL of ropivacaine has been injected. Once injection of local
      anesthetic has commenced small needle adjustments are allowed to enhance spread. This will
      be done at the discretion of the regional anesthesiologist performing the block.
