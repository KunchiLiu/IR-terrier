      The purpose of the research study of the K23 award is to develop a blood test that can check
      how much alcohol a person has consumed in the past few days. We will enroll heavy social
      drinkers who do not have alcohol-related problems but used to drinking 5 or more beers on a
      single occasion. Both men and women between ages 21 and 65 years can join the study. All
      participants must be of European decent.
