  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plastic bronchitis (PB) is a rare, most often pediatric disease characterized by the
      formation of obstructive airway casts primarily composed of fibrin. There is presently no
      FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for PB, but acute exacerbations of the illness are often
      treated with inhaled tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). To date, this is done somewhat
      anecdotally because there has been no safety or efficacy testing of this treatment. In
      addition, there is presently no reliable surrogate marker of adverse drug events.
      Nevertheless, in the absence of inhaled tPA treatment, PB-induced respiratory distress can
      be severe, often warranting urgent or emergent bronchoscopy for cast removal, or can
      sometimes result in respiratory failure. As such there is a significant unmet need for
      safety and efficacy testing of inhaled tPA and for biomarkers of drug response.

      Objectives and Endpoints: The objectives of this protocol are to: 1) test the safety and
      efficacy of an inhaled tPA regimen in children with PB; and 2) identify potential candidate
      biomarkers of inhaled tPA drug response. Safety endpoints will consist of the development of
      new, active bleeding that is systemic and/or pulmonary and/or new hematuria (defined as
      gross hematuria or 2+ microscopic hematuria). Secondary endpoints of efficacy will also be
      measured (e.g., frequency of cast production). Urine and blood will also be collected for
      the development of potential biomarkers of inhaled tPA drug response.
