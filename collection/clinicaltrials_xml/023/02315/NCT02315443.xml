  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NA-1 is effective in reducing global
      disability in patients with acute cerebral ischemia if administered early after symptom
      onset.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NA-1 is being developed as an emergency drug aimed at reducing global disability in patients
      with acute cerebral ischemia if administered early after symptom onset.

      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of NA-1 in reducing global disability in
      patients with acute stroke. The secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of NA-1
      in reducing functional dependence, improving neurological outcome, increasing the proportion
      of subjects whose symptoms fully return to baseline function within 24 hours of symptom
      onset, and improving activities of daily living.The leading safety objectives are to
      determine the effect of administering a target dose of 2.60 mg/kg IV infusion of NA-1 early
      after symptom onset by paramedics in the field on serious adverse events and 90-day
      mortality.

      This trial is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose study
      initiated prehospital in the ambulance. It is being conducted using the Emergency Medical
      Services (EMS) of Toronto and Peel Region, ON and Vancouver, BC, Canada. Subjects with
      suspected acute stroke will be identified in the field by trained paramedics using the
      approved stroke protocol in use by the local EMS system, and further screened for
      eligibility and approval by an on-call trial physician. The paramedics will administer the
      study drug. Upon arrival at the emergency department, subjects will receive
      standard-of-care.

      The primary hypothesis to be tested is that administration of NA-1 will result in a lower
      proportion of subjects with global disability at Day 90 as assessed by the Modified Rankin
      Scale.

      An independent, central adjudication committee will be responsible for arriving at a final
      diagnosis of acute cerebral ischemia versus an alternate diagnosis. An Independent Data
      Monitoring Committee will perform safety reviews of the clinical data.

    <description>The mRS is a valid and reliable clinician-reported measure of global disability that has been widely applied for evaluating recovery from stroke. It is a scale used to measure functional recovery (the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities) of people who have suffered a stroke.</description>
