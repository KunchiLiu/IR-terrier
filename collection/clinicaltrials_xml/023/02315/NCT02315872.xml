  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of Acthar gel (ACTH) in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis who are
      experiencing chronic fatigue.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to demonstrate
      the safety, tolerability, and effect of ACTH on fatigue in patients with relapsing multiple
      sclerosis (RMS). The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of ACTH
      versus placebo in reducing fatigability in patients with RMS. Secondary objectives include
      assessment of the tolerability and safety of twice-weekly ACTH treatment vs. placebo and
      evaluation of ACTH on depression, sleepiness, and quality of life measures and correlations
      between these measures.

    <description>The study drug (ACTH 40 units) will be given subcutaneously twice weekly for 2 weeks. If the patient tolerates this dosage regimen, the dose will be increased to 80 units twice weekly. If the 80 unit dosage is not tolerated, the dosage will be reduced to 40 units twice weekly for the remainder of the 24 week participation. The weekly doses will be given 3 days apart, for example, on every Monday and Thursday or every Tuesday and Friday.</description>
