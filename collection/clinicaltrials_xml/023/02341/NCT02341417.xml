    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, 32-week, multicenter, single arm, open-label extension study. All
      enrolled subjects will be administered cinacalcet daily during the treatment period in
      addition to standard of care treatment which can include therapy with Vitamin D sterols,
      calcium supplementation, and phosphate binders.
