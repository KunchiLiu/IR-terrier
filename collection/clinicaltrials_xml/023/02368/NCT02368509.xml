  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on sensorial
      perception in lung cancer patients in comparison to a control group (individuals without
      lung cancer and chemotherapy treatment). We will use a longitudinal approach whereby 44
      patients and 44 controls will be tested for olfactory and gustatory abilities before and
      after treatment (for patients) and for two sessions separated by the same duration for
      controls. Primary measure outcome will be to examine the impact of treatment on the
      perception of hedonic valence of odors. Secondary measure outcome will include odor and
      taste perceptual changes and questionnaires on eating habits and behaviors, in order to
      examine the impact of treatment on odor, taste and food perception.
