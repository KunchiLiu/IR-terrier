      Background:

      - Ryanodine receptor type 1-related myopathies (RYR1-RM) are the most common muscle diseases
      that people are born with in the U.S. They affect development, muscles, and walking.
      Researchers want to test a new drug to help people with these diseases.

      Objectives:

      - To see if the drug N-acetylcysteine decreases muscle damage in people with RYR1-RM. To see
      if it improves their exercise tolerance.

      Eligibility:

      - People age 7 and older with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of RYR1 or a clinical diagnosis
      of RYR1 and a family member with a confirmed genetic diagnosis.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a checklist of criteria. They will have a muscle
           biopsy. A needle will remove a tiny piece of muscle in the lower leg.

        -  Study visits will take several days.

        -  Visit 1:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood, urine, and saliva tests

        -  Questions about symptoms and quality of life

        -  Heart, lung, and walking tests

        -  Muscle Oxygenation Capacity Test. A blood pressure cuff around the thigh will be
           tightened for up to 10 minutes.

        -  Biodex testing, stretching the leg against resistance

        -  Muscle ultrasounds. A probe will be moved over the skin.

        -  Participants may be photographed or videotaped during procedures.

        -  They may have a muscle biopsy.

        -  Six months later, visit 2 will repeat visit 1. Participants will start taking the study
           drug dissolved in water or placebo three times a day for 6 months.

        -  Participants will stay at NIH for 2 days after starting the study drug.

        -  Participants will keep an online pill diary daily and be contacted by phone during the
           study.

        -  Six months after starting the study drug, study visit 3 will repeat some or all of
           visit 1.

      Although genetic disorders of muscle that present at birth are rare, RYR1-related myopathies
      comprise the most common non-dystrophic congenital myopathy in the United States, with a
      prevalence of approximately 1/90,000 people (Amburgey et al, 2011). Causative mutations in
      the ryanodine receptor gene of skeletal muscle, RYR1, have been found in several myopathy
      subtypes, including central core disease and centronuclear myopathy. These mutations result
      in defective excitation-contraction coupling and increased mitochondrial oxidative stress.
      Most patients present in childhood with delayed motor milestones, extremity muscle weakness,
      impaired ambulation, joint contractures, progressive scoliosis, and in some cases eye
      movement paralysis, respiratory failure, or susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, an
      allelic condition. Despite these important morbidities and the risk of early mortality, no
      treatments exist to date.

      RYR1 encodes a homotetrameric transmembrane ion channel, RyR1, which resides on the terminal
      sarcoplasmic reticulum in close proximity to the T-tubule. By releasing calcium from the
      sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol in response to muscle fiber stimulation by the motor
      neuron at the neuromuscular junction, it mediates excitation-contraction coupling and
      functions as a regulator of cellular calcium concentrations and redox homeostasis. Dowling
      et al. (2012) recently elucidated the latter mechanism in zebrafish and patient myotubes,
      showing that RYR1 mutations result in increased oxidative stress and that this is rescued in
      both models by treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a known anti-oxidant. NAC functions as
      a precursor of glutathione, an endogenous antioxidant that becomes deficient during
      oxidative stress. This was substantiated by a cystic fibrosis clinical trial in which low
      glutathione levels in neutrophils undergoing oxidative stress significantly increased with
      NAC administration.

      Dowling et al. (2012) found significant changes post NAC treatment including increased
      travel distance (endurance) in zebrafish and complete protection from cell death induced by
      experimentally increasing oxidative stress in myotubes. Thus NAC was a successful treatment
      in both ex vivo and in vivo model systems. Based on these results, we plan to perform a
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial of NAC in a subgroup of
      RYR1-related myopathy patients, those with central core disease, as the first
      pathophysiologically based treatment for this devastating disorder.

      The objectives of the study are to determine if NAC reduces oxidative stress, fatigability,
      and fatigue in a study population of patients with RYR1-RM. The study population includes
      both males and females 7 years of age and older. The study design has two phases. The first
      6-month phase will be used to validate the selected outcome measures in RYR1 congenital
      myopathy. The second 6-month phase is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled drug
      intervention trial. The primary outcome measures are blood glutathione for oxidative stress
      and six minute walk test for fatigability. Healthy volunteers will be evaluated to determine
      normal values of biomarkers, muscle ultrasound, and near infrared spectroscopy in this rare
      disease, in order to develop a comparison between healthy and RYR1-RM individuals.
