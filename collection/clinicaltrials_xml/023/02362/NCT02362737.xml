    <textblock>
      This study will test ways to improve health behaviors using an intervention that has been
      specially designed for African-American men. The program, called Active &amp; Healthy
      Brotherhood (AHB), will provide information on basic health, and healthy eating, physical
      activity, stress management, and how to get medical care when needed.The AHB intervention
      will be compared to a control group that will receive basic health information in videos and
      brochures.
