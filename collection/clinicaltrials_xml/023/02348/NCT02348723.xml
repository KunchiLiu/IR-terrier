  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety of an uninterrupted dabigatran
      etexilate periprocedural anticoagulant regimen compared to an uninterrupted warfarin regimen
      in NVAF patients undergoing AF ablation in a PROBE (Prospective, randomized, open label,
      blinded end point) active controlled study.

      Secondary objectives are to assess additional safety endpoints and efficacy in this clinical
      setting.

      It is not intended to assess confirmatory hypothesis, this is an exploratory study.

          -  Patient with paroxysmal or persistent NVAF with a planned catheter ablation for AF
             unless it is performed an investigational ablation technique.

          -  AF must have been documented at least once either by ECG, Holter monitoring, loop
             recorder, telemetry, trans-telephonic monitoring, pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator
             read outs within 24 months prior to screening (Visit 1).

          -  The patient must be able to give informed consent in accordance with International
             Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and local
             legislation and/or regulations.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with permanent AF.

          -  Patients with AF felt to be secondary to an obvious reversible cause such as, but not
             limited to, an acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, recent surgery,
             pericarditis or thyrotoxicosis.

          -  Patients with LA size &gt;= 60 mm
