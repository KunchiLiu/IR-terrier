    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study to assess the ability of 11C- and 18F-choline to detect and localize
      prostate cancer within the prostate gland in patients with unfavorable intermediate to
      high-risk prostate cancer (CAPRA 5-10). Secondary objectives will assess the ability of 11C-
      and 18F-choline PET/MR to detect metastatic prostate cancer within pelvic lymph nodes in
      patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection, to
      assess the ability of 11C- and 18F-choline PET/MR to detect the specific location of
      metastatic prostate cancer within pelvic lymph node regions in patients undergoing radical
      prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection, to determine the agreement of 11C-
      and 18F-choline PET imaging in the detection and localization of local and metastatic
      disease with other imaging techniques/methods (bone scan, CT, multiparametric 1H MRI,
      advanced body NaF PET/CT), and to determine the temporal distribution of 11C- and
      18F-choline radiotracer in patients. The tissue uptake, retention, and clearance will be
      determined. An exploratory objective comparing regions of uptake from the 11C- and
      18F-choline PET/MR and sentinel lymph node imaging will be performed.
