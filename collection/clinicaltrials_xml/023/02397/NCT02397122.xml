    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of coronally advanced flap
      (CAF)+connective tissue graft(CTG)+platelet-rich fibrin(PRF) combination in Miller I and II
      recession treatment by comparing with CAF+CTG. 40 patients were surgically treated either
      with CAF+CTG+PRF (test group) or CAF+CTG (control group). Clinical parameters of plaque
      index (PI), gingival index (GI), vertical recession (VR), probing depth (PD), attachment
      level (AL), keratinized tissue width (KTW), horizontal recession (HR), MGJ localization
      (L-MGJ), tissue thickness (TT) were recorded at baseline, 3 months (PS1) and 6 months (PS2)
      post-surgery. Root coverage (RC), complete RC (CRC), attachment gain (AG), and keratinized
      tissue change (KTC) were also calculated.
