  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this phase I/II, randomized, placebo controlled study is the assessment
      of safety and tolerability of universal donor FMT compared to placebo in pediatric and young
      adult subjects (ages 5 years through 30 years) with active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have
      previously failed traditional, first-line maintenance therapy (aminosalicylates) or are
      intolerant to therapy. Secondary objectives include the identification biomarkers in both
      donor and recipient that may confer a clinical response and to establish whether or not
      ongoing FMT maintenance therapy is required for maintenance of clinical benefit in pediatric
      UC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, phase I/II, randomized, prospective, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled study of FMT in the treatment of active pediatric UC. The primary aim is
      to assess safety and feasibility of a weekly FMT maintenance therapy. A total of 60 patients
      with active UC (as defined by PUCAI score of &gt;9) will be enrolled and randomized to receive
      FMT or placebo-FMT (study treatment) by retention enema for 1 week and oral, frozen
      encapsulated inocula/placebo for 7 weeks. After the first 8 weeks, subjects on FMT who
      improve or subjects on placebo-FMT who do not improve will have the option to continue on
      study treatment or switch to open-label FMT until the end of 6 months from study initiation.
      Subjects will be followed by telephone to assess adverse events for a total of 6 months
      after their last FMT dose.

      An initial subset of 10 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive FMT or placebo.
      We'd expect short term adverse events to occur within 7 days of FMT administration. Subject
      safety data will be reviewed completely 7 days after all subjects have received at least 2
      doses of study drug prior to continuing enrollment or open label use of FMT.

      Patient metadata and stool samples will be collected at key time points. The
      patient-reported metadata collection technique will allow for numerous clinical correlations
      to be parsed out using the random forest machine learning capabilities of synthetic learning
      in microbial ecology (SLiME) to identify taxonomic features associated with important
      clinical parameters.
