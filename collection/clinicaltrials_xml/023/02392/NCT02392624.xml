  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate efficacy and safety of
      subcutaneous omalizumab as an add-on therapy through 48 weeks. After completing an initial
      24-week open-label treatment period with omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks, participants
      responding to omalizumab will be randomized at a 3:2 ratio (omalizumab:placebo) to either
      continue omalizumab or be transitioned to placebo for a further 24 weeks.
