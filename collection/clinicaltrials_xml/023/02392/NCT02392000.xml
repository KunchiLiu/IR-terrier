    <textblock>
      Many Veterans of the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan struggle with chronic insomnia
      (trouble falling or staying asleep). Most current interventions for insomnia are
      time-consuming, making it difficult for this younger, working group of Veterans to use and
      benefit from these interventions. The investigators will assess whether Veterans find it
      helpful to use two health information technology tools, one for measuring participant sleep
      (the WatchPAT) and one for managing participant sleep (the CBTI Coach). The WatchPAT will
      measure physiological sleep in the Veteran participant's home. The CBTI Coach is a mobile
      health application used on the Veteran's mobile phone or tablet to teach skills that can
      reduce insomnia. The investigators will combine use of the WatchPAT with the CBTI Coach so
      Veterans can self-manage insomnia at home. Participants will record their physiological
      sleep and self-report on their sleep at home during a 6 week self-management program. The
      investigators will measure if Veterans find the tools helpful and easy to use, and which
      Veterans find the tools most helpful.

    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance in the form of chronic insomnia (difficulty in falling or staying asleep)
      is a major health care problem for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom
      (OIF), and Operation New Dawn (OND) Veterans. Chronic insomnia is often co-morbid with
      mental and behavioral health issues such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild
      traumatic brain injury (mTBI), which are common in these Veterans. Current behavioral
      interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) that are used to treat
      chronic insomnia are effective, but time-consuming. As a result, this largely younger,
      working cohort of Veterans does not use and benefit from these interventions as much as they
      could. The investigators will assess the usability and feasibility of two health information
      technology (HIT) tools for measuring objective and subjective sleep, and for self-managing
      chronic insomnia. An existing mobile sleep monitoring device used by some VA sleep clinics,
      the WatchPAT, will be used to measure objective sleep parameters in the Veteran's home. A
      benefit of this tool is that it can detect probable sleep apnea, which will permit referral
      of these Veterans for sleep apnea treatment instead of insomnia self-management. An existing
      VA mobile health application (or app), the CBTI Coach, can be used on a mobile device to
      teach skills to reduce insomnia based on the elements of manualized CBTI. The goal is to
      combine the WatchPAT and the CBTI Coach along with self-management guidance to help Veterans
      with chronic insomnia learn how to improve their sleep. As part of a 6-week pre-post
      intervention pilot usability and feasibility trial, patients will record their objective and
      subjective sleep at home at the beginning of the 6-week self-management trial and again at
      the end. Subjective sleep reports in the form of sleep diaries will be measured throughout
      the program as part of using the CBTI Coach app. The objective and subjective sleep reports
      will be combined and accessible from the mobile device and can be used to help guide sleep
      self-management by the participant. Self-management will be aided by self-management
      worksheets and features of the CBTI Coach App. Usability of the two HIT tools will be
      assessed within the conceptual framework of an Integrated Technology Acceptance Model via
      survey items about each of the HIT tools. Feasibility will be assessed using measures of the
      number of times that elements of the CBTI Coach were accessed during the 6-week program, and
      from a semi-structured qualitative interview conducted at the end of the program. In the
      interview, the investigators will obtain information about the barriers to and facilitators
      of use of the WatchPAT and CBTI Coach. If there is high use of these tools for insomnia
      self-management, then the pilot study will have provided important incremental value to the
      new VA CBTI Coach app. The investigators also will collect data about the user factors that
      impact use of the tools (e.g., depression, mild traumatic brain injury, age), and thereby
      either be able to target the tools toward those most likely to use them, or suggest further
      developments to increase use by potential users. The pilot sample will provide preliminary
      data on sleep outcomes. The proposed work is responsive to multiple priority areas for HSR&amp;D
      including Healthcare Informatics, Healthcare Access, Mental and Behavioral Health, and
      Post-deployment Health. By partnering with the VA Office of Connected Health (Web and Mobile
      Solutions), the VA's eHealth QUERI, and the developers of the VA CBTI Coach App, the
      investigators will ensure that these findings are maximally useful for future versions of
      the CBTI Coach app. The investigators also will be able to determine the usefulness of an
      integrated mobile sleep assessment and self-management program that can be used by Veterans
      anywhere.

             interfere with daily functioning).

          -  In addition, eligible individuals must be willing to use a device provided by the
             study team (an iPod touch).

        Exclusion Criteria:

             the Telephone Mini Mental State Exam,

          -  inability to speak and read English,

          -  or malformation of the fingers that would preclude use of the WatchPAT device.

          -  In addition, individuals meeting criteria for current active psychosis, mania,
             suicidal ideation with plan and intent, or excessive alcohol use as determined using
             the AUDIT-C will be excluded from participation.

          -  Those with greater than mild sleep apnea as determined based on a WatchPAT-based
             Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI] &gt; 15/hour of sleep, will be withdrawn from the study and
             referred for sleep apnea treatment.
