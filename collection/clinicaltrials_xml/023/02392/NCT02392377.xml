    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies how well molecular phenotyping works in
      predicting response in patients with stage IB-III esophageal cancer who are receiving
      carboplatin and paclitaxel or oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil. Studying
      the genes in a patients tumor cells before, during, and after chemotherapy may help in
      understanding if there are specific features of the tumor cells that make a person more or
      less likely to respond to treatment and how these features may be affected by treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate gene and micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) expression levels in patients with
      esophageal adenocarcinoma prior to receiving chemotherapy and identify relative expression
      differences between patients responding and not responding to treatment with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel or 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil) and oxaliplatin as measured by fludeoxyglucose
      F-18 ([18F] FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of treatment on expression patterns of both genes and miRNAs in
      patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma following treatment with either carboplatin and
      paclitaxel or 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, and identify expression patterns associated
      with treatment response and resistance as assessed by (18F) FDG-PET.

      II. To evaluate the expression patterns of genes and miRNAs in patients with esophageal
      adenocarcinoma prior to and following a full neoadjuvant combined-modality treatment program
      with either carboplatin and paclitaxel or 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin chemotherapy plus
      radiation, and identify relative expression differences between patients achieving a
      pathologic complete response and patients not achieving a pathologic complete response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and carboplatin
      intravenously IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CHEMORADIATION THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenous piggyback (IVPB) over 60
      minutes and carboplatin IVPB over 30 minutes on days 8 and 22. Patients also undergo
      radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week. Treatment continues for 5-6 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2-6 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours. Treatment repeats every 14 days
      for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CHEMORADIATION THERAPY: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2-6 hours on days 1, 15, and 29
      and fluorouracil IV continuously over 96 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Patients also
      undergo radiation therapy QD 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: In both arms, approximately 4-10 weeks after completion of chemoradiation therapy,
      patients undergo esophagectomy at the discretion of the treating team.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then
      periodically thereafter.
