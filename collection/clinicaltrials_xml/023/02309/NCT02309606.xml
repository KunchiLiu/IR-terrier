  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine affects 16% of the world population and is one of the most disabling of all
      disorders. It is a complex brain disorder characterized primarily by recurrent headache
      attacks. The signaling molecule serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has for decades been
      thought to play a central role in migraine pathophysiology. The most effective class of
      abortive migraine drugs, the triptans, act on 5-HT receptors. However, the migraine-specific
      actions of serotonin and the mechanisms of triptans are still unknown. In this project the
      investigators will use high-resolution positron emission tomography and specific
      radioligands to investigate the significance of serotonin in migraine. Two newly developed
      radioligands that are specific for the 5-HT1B and 5-HT4 receptor, respectively, will be
      applied. To investigate the level and distribution of serotonin in the migraine brain the
      investigators will compare the binding of these ligands in episodic migraine patients with
      healthy controls. In addition, the investigators will include chronic migraine patients to
      evaluate the relation between the level of serotonin in the brain and the frequency of
      migraine attacks. To investigate the changes in the serotonin level during a migraine attack
      and the effects of triptans on the central nervous system the investigators will repeat the
      scans using the 5-HT1B specific ligand during induced migraine attacks and following
      treatment with sumatriptan. The results from this study will shed light on the role of
      serotonin in the migraine brain and elucidate the migraine-specific action of triptans. This
      will improve our understanding of the migraine pathophysiology and, potentially, facilitate
      the development of more efficient treatment of migraine.
