      Supervisors of injured workers play a key role in preventing prolonged work absences.
      Providing supervisors with tools to improve their response to musculoskeletal and other
      workplace injuries or illnesses may improve worker health and disability outcomes.

      The primary objective of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of the
      supervisor training program, the SMART Supervisor Training Program, on reducing the total
      duration of workers' lost-time claims. The secondary objectives are 1) to determine the
      effectiveness of the training program on reducing the cumulative incidence of workers'
      lost-time injuries and sick leave days; 2) to determine if implementation of the training
      program is associated with improvements in hypothesized mediating variables, such as
      attitudes toward job accommodations, response to workplace injury, and communication with
      employees and healthcare providers; 3) to investigate the implementation of the training
      program by conducting a process evaluation.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. the duration of lost-time claims for workers working under supervisors receiving the
           training program will be shorter than the duration of lost-time claims for workers with
           supervisors in the control group;

        2. the cumulative incidence of lost-time injuries and sick leave days will be lower in the
           group receiving the training program compared to the control group;

        3. the training program will be associated with increased knowledge, response,
           communication and changed attitudes towards workplace accommodation.

      This research is of significance to North American employers and compensation systems
      because there is a lack of knowledge about the usefulness of supervisor training to prevent
      or reduce work disability. It also has important implications for guiding employer policies
      and practices, and for identifying circumstances where supervisor training should be a
      priority.

      This study is a multi-centred, cluster randomized, controlled, single-blinded, fixed sample
      trial.

      The project will involve several large Canadian and American employers. Participating work
      units within the organizations will be randomly assigned to either the training program
      (intervention group) or not (control group). Randomizing geographically separate work units
      works best to prevent contamination of supervisors selected to be the control group.
      However, the employer will decide what constitutes a work unit (e.g., separate building,
      division, etc.). The work units will be pair-matched into clusters based on number of
      employees, gender proportions, and work tasks as best as possible. A total of 86 work units
      (43 work unit pairs) including approximately 350 supervisors is required to achieve the
      primary objective, with fewer work units and supervisors required to achieve the secondary
      objectives. Within each cluster, one work unit will receive the training program and the
      other will act as the control. All supervisors within those work units randomized to receive
      the intervention will attend a four-hour supervisor training session. Before training is
      administered to the randomly assigned work units, all supervisors (intervention group and
      control group) will receive an email with an attached information pamphlet about principles
      for successful return to work. The purpose of the information pamphlet is to minimize the
      Hawthorne Effect, whereby subjects change their behaviour in response to the knowledge that
      they are being studied or monitored.

      The work disability outcomes (duration of lost-time injuries in days, and cumulative
      incidence of lost-time injuries and sick leave days) will be determined from workplace
      records, and outcomes data will be extracted and analyzed at the level of the work unit.
      Since the intervention is a training program, it is impossible to blind the participating
      supervisors. However, the data extractor and individuals working in each employer's
      Occupational Health &amp; Safety Department will be blinded to the results of the work unit
      randomization and no other workers will be informed if the supervisors in their work unit
      received the training program or not.

      To collect information about the hypothesized mediating variables, consenting supervisors
      will be asked to complete three online questionnaires: baseline and two follow-up
      questionnaires (three and six months post-randomization). The baseline and follow-up
      questionnaires will also collect information on potential moderating and confounding factors
      including workplace safety culture, supervisor autonomy, corporate disability management,
      leadership style, workplace social capital, and workers' physical work demands, supervisor
      demographics, and characteristics of supervised workers (e.g., number, gender proportions,
      unionization status). Analysis of the mediating variables will be conducted at the level of
      the work unit. Data for the process evaluation will be obtained from a brief exit training
      program evaluation survey distributed to participants in the intervention group as well as
      the three and six month follow-up questionnaires.

      This is a pragmatic, intent-to-treat trail, so participants will be analyzed according to
      the group they were randomly assigned to. However, the investigators will also obtain
      information about supervisor transfers among work units (and the direction of the transfers)
      for the one year period post-randomization to understand how such transfers may have
      influenced the results.

    <description>All supervisors from work units randomized to the intervention will receive a supervisor training program, the Supervisor/Manager Accommodation Recognition &amp; Training (SMART) Program. This training program is modeled on a program developed by Shaw and colleagues of the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety (LMRIS). The aim of the training program is to prevent/reduce work disability by improving supervisor communication, response to workplace injury, and problem solving mechanisms. The training program is designed to be administered by two facilitators to groups of 10 to 12 supervisors, during one 4-hour session or two 2-hour sessions. The training program delivery mode includes PowerPoint presentation with supplementary audio or video segments, case studies, and group discussion.</description>
