    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety of using the combination of
      decitabine and a cancer vaccine plus Hiltonol. The vaccine will be made from the subject's
      blood cells and is designed to interact in the subject's body with cells that are programmed
      to fight specific tumor proteins called NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3. The decitabine will
      be given to increase the amount and activity of these cancer proteins on the surface of
      tumor cells to increase the possibility that the vaccine will stimulate cells to act against
      the tumor cells. Subjects will be assessed to determine how these tumors respond to the
      treatment.

      One of the challenges of the practical application of immunotherapy for brain tumors is the
      lack of expression of tumor antigens as well as the down-regulation of MHC Class I and II
      molecules, which are needed for antigen presentation. Considering the ability of DAC to
      facilitate the expression of CT antigens and MHC molecules and the fact that it has good
      blood brain barrier penetration, it is reasonable to test this approach in a vaccine study
      for patients who have experienced disease recurrence. The use of a combined approach to
      tumor immunotherapy - antigen upregulation followed by vaccination - has not been studied in
      this patient population, and there is a strong biologic rationale for this strategy.

      Patients with pediatric brain tumors (medulloblastoma, CNS PNET, high grade glioma) who have
      experienced disease relapse or progressive refractory disease will be eligible. Each cycle
      will consist of DAC at low dose administered over a 5 day period, followed by two weekly
      vaccinations consisting of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with pooled, overlapping
      peptide mixes derived from full-length MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, and NY-ESO-1. This dose of DAC is
      lower than all previously reported doses that have been safely administered in adult
      patients with MDS and AML, and was used in a previous protocol for relapsed and refractory
      pediatric neuroblastoma and sarcomas. A novel way of stimulating CD4 and CD8 antigen
      specific T cells is to use a DC vaccine approach in which the cells are pulsed with
      overlapping peptides derived from these antigens, so that patients from several different
      HLA backgrounds can be enrolled. Overlapping peptide mixes derived from full-length
      NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1, or MAGE-A3 have been acquired from JPT Peptide Technologies, consisting
      of 15-mers, with 11 amino acid overlap. The number of DC given in our study (8-10 x 106
      peptide pulsed DC) is within the range of doses given in previous studies. Vaccinations are
      spaced at weekly intervals, based on multiple previous studies in which this approach is
      taken, and the fact that in vitro re-stimulation of CTL generally occurs on a weekly basis.
      GM-CSF is given days 1 through 5 during vaccine weeks, to minimize leukopenia from DAC and
      to help facilitate antigen presenting cell function. The adjuvant poly-ICLC (Hiltonol) will
      be injected immediately after and adjacent to DC vaccine site to enhance DC maturation. We
      will accrue 10 patients with relapsed, refractory, or progressive pediatric brain tumors
      over a 3 year period. Cycles will repeat every five weeks, for two cycles. Patients who do
      not have disease progression after two cycles may receive an additional two cycles of
      therapy.
