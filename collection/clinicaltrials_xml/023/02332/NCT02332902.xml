  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is evaluating the use of oral Everolimus to determine if there is a reduction in
      the size of the disfiguring cutaneous lesions in patients with Neurofibromatosis 1 over a 6
      month period. The evaluation will be done by 3D photography measuring volume with the
      LIFEVIZ Micro system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Qualifying subjects will have a diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis 1 and have disfiguring
      cutaneous lesions that can be measured by photography. The subjects will have photographs of
      the target lesions,biopsies of the lesions,and safety blood laboratory tests at 3 time
      points (baseline, 3 months and 6 months which is end of treatment). Everolimus will be taken
      orally for 6 months. Subjects will visit the clinic monthly for an exam and adverse event
      evaluation. Laboratory testing will be done at these visits if determined necessary by the
      PI.
