    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies 90-yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan and combination
      chemotherapy compared with combination chemotherapy alone before stem cell transplant in
      treating patients with diffuse large b-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a
      period of improvement. Radioactive substances linked to monoclonal antibodies, such as
      90-yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan, can bind to cancer cells and give off radiation which may
      help kill cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carmustine, etoposide phosphate,
      cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM), work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. It is not yet known whether 90-yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan and BEAM before a
      stem cell transplant are more effective than BEAM alone in treating patients with diffuse
      large b-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare overall survival (OS) between the two transplant arms,
      with at least a two year of follow-up. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare progression-free
      survival (PFS), complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) proportion at day 100, time
      to hematopoietic recovery, incidence of infection, grade III-IV toxicities,
      treatment-related mortality, incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and secondary
      acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive rituximab
      intravenously (IV) on days -21 and -14, and 90-yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan IV on day -14.
      Patients also receive BEAM comprising carmustine IV over 4 hours on day -6; cytarabine IV
      over 2 hours twice daily (BID) on days -5 to -2; etoposide IV over 1 hour BID or once daily
      (QD) on days -5 to -2; and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients then undergo peripheral blood
      stem cell (PBSC) transplant on day 0. ARM II: Patients receive BEAM as in Arm I and undergo
      PBSC transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 30 days, 100 days,
      6 months, 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years.
