  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II study will assess the impact of pre-conditioning on migration and
      survival among newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients who have undergone definitive
      resection and completed standard temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation treatment, as well as the
      impact of tetanus pre-conditioning and basiliximab together on survival. After completing
      standard of care radiotherapy with concurrent TMZ, patients will be randomized to 1 of 3
      treatment arms: 1). receive cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific dendritic cell (DC) vaccines with
      unpulsed (not loaded) DC pre-coinditioning prior to the 4th vaccine; 2). receive
      CMV-specific DC vaccines with Tetanus-Diphtheria Toxoid (Td) pre-conditioning prior to the
      4th vaccine; 3). receive basiliximab infusions prior to the 1st and 2nd DC vaccines along
      with Td pre-conditioning prior to the 4th vaccine. A permuted block randomization algorithm
      using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio will be used to assign patients to a treatment arm.
      Randomization will be stratified by CMV status (positive, negative), with the assignment to
      arms I and II being double-blinded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A maximum of 116 patients with resected, newly-diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO)
      Grade IV GBM who are found eligible will be enrolled. All consented patients will undergo a
      leukapheresis after resection for harvest of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBLs) for
      generation of DCs. Patients will then receive Radiation Therapy (RT) and concurrent TMZ at a
      standard targeted dose of 75 mg/m^2/d. Patients who experience progressive disease during
      radiation, are dependent on steroid supplements above physiologic levels at time of first
      vaccination, are unable to tolerate TMZ, or whose DCs or PBLs fail to meet release criteria
      will be withdrawn from the study and replaced and will not undergo repeat leukapheresis. For
      patients whose initial leukapheresis yields less than 3 vaccines, repeat leukapheresis may
      be obtained a minimum of 2 weeks from the previous leukapheresis (and may be repeated as
      needed) if pre-pheresis blood work is within the Apheresis Center's parameters and as long
      as this does not cause a significant delay in treatment for the patient. The remaining
      patients will then be randomized and begin the initial cycle of TMZ at a standard targeted
      dose of 150-200mg/m^2/d for 5 days at the discretion of the treating oncologist 3 (± 1)
      weeks after completing RT. The study cycle of TMZ comprises a targeted dose of
      150-200mg/m^2/d for 5 days every 5 (± 1) weeks. All patients will receive up to a total of
      10 DC vaccines given bilaterally at the groin site unless progression occurs. DC vaccines
      will be given intradermally (i.d.) and divided equally to both inguinal regions. DC vaccines
      #1-3 will be given every two weeks, thus delaying the initiation of TMZ cycle 2. All
      remaining TMZ cycles will continue as per standard of care. The day before the first DC
      vaccination, all patients will receive immunization with 0.5 mL of Td intramuscularly into
      the deltoid muscle to ensure adequate immunity to the tetanus antigen. Those assigned to
      Group III will receive basiliximab 20 mg infusions 1 week before the 1st and 1 week before
      the 2nd vaccine. At the time of the fourth DC vaccine, patients will receive
      pre-conditioning per the assigned group (Group I-unpulsed DCs i.d.; Group II- Td i.d.; Group
      III-Td i.d.). A single dose of Td toxoid (1 flocculation unit, in 0.3 milliliters (mLs) of
      saline for a total volume of 0.4 mLs) or 0.4 mLs of 1 x 10^6 autologous unpulsed DCs in
      saline will be administered to a single side of the groin, and 0.4 mLs of saline
      administered to the contralateral side 12-24 hours prior to the fourth DC vaccine, which is
      always given bilaterally at the groin site. Patients in Groups I and II will then receive
      111In-labeled DCs to compare the effects of different skin preparations on DC migration
      followed by Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography and Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT)
      imaging immediately and at 1 and 2 days after injection. Group III will not undergo
      migration studies, but will return on the same days as Groups I and II for blood work for
      immune monitoring - which Groups I and II will also have drawn. Groups I and II will be
      double blinded. Group III will not be blinded.

      All patients will undergo leukapheresis again for immunologic monitoring with specific
      assessment of baseline antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses and further DC
      generations 4 ± 2 weeks after vaccine #3. Patients will then be vaccinated in conjunction
      with subsequent TMZ cycles every 5 ± 1 weeks for a total of 6 to 12 cycles after RT at the
      discretion of the treating oncologist. DCs will be given on day 21 ± 2 days of each TMZ
      cycle. DC vaccinations will continue during TMZ cycles up to a total of 10 unless
      progression occurs. Patients will be imaged bimonthly without receiving any other prescribed
      anti-tumor therapy. Patients will undergo an additional leukapheresis for generation of DCs
      if needed to continue vaccinations. As part of standard care for these patients, upon tumor
      progression, participants may undergo stereotactic biopsy or resection. As this is not a
      research procedure consent will be obtained separately. However, if tissue is obtained, it
      will be used to confirm tumor progression histologically and to assess immunologic cell
      infiltration and pp65 antigen escape at the tumor site.

    <description>The Kaplan-Meier estimator will be used to describe the survival within each of the 3 treatment arms. Median survival will be estimated within each arm, with 95% confidence intervals. OS will be defined as the time between randomization and death, or last follow-up if alive. Two pairwise one-tailed log-rank tests will be conducted to assess the impact of Td and/or basiliximab. One test will compare the survival experience of patients in the TD toxoid arm (Group II) and the unpulsed DC arm (Group I), and the other test will compare the survival experience within the basiliximab arm (Group III) and the unpulsed DC arm (Group I). An intent-to-treat philosophy will be followed in these analyses.</description>

    <description>Within Groups 1 and 2, the percentage of 111In-labeled DCs reaching inguinal nodes at vaccination #4 is calculated from the initial signal at the injection site in the groin to 48 hours post-vaccination. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to compare assigned treatment groups (Groups I and II) with respect to migration. This analysis will be based upon the first 12 patients within each arm (Groups I and II) that receive vaccination #4.</description>
