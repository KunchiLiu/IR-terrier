  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post market prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter study, designed to
      demonstrate dose response of an ablation system using a percutaneous approach in patients
      with primary, metastatic, or recurrent primary lung tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Endpoint: Dose response as indicated by CT imaging, measurement of maximum diameter
      and volume.

      Secondary Endpoint: Assessment of complete tumor ablation immediately post-procedure.

             standard practices) or is actively breast-feeding.

          -  Subject has participated in an investigational drug or device research study within
             30 days of enrollment that would interfere with this study.
