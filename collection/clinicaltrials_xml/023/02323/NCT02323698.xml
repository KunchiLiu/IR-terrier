  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence suggests that repeatedly breathing low oxygen levels for brief periods
      (termed intermittent hypoxia) is a safe and effective treatment strategy to promote
      meaningful functional recovery in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). The goal of
      the study is to understand how caffeine may augment the effects of intermittent hypoxia on
      motor function and spinal plasticity (ability of the nervous system to strengthen neural
      pathways based on new experiences) following SCI.

      The investigators will examine the effects of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) as a possible
      therapeutic intervention to promote functionally useful motor recovery. In this sub-study,
      the investigators will assess changes in leg motor function in response to repetitive AIH
      with and without caffeine.

      Participants will receive caffeine+AIH, placebo+AIH, caffeine+SHAM, and placebo+SHAM in a
      randomized order. Before each intervention round, subjects will be asked to avoid
      caffeine-containing substances for 48 hrs (&gt; 5* half-life of ~7 hrs) prior to arrival to
      control for baseline plasma levels of caffeine. Subjects will then ingest capsules
      containing either placebo (dextrose) or caffeine (up to 6mg/kg). Capsules will be prepared
      by Emory University Investigational Drug Services. Saliva samples will be collected before
      and after the breathing intervention using a standard passive drool protocol to assess
      caffeine concentrations within the body. The subject will be asked to collect saliva in
      their mouth and drool into a vial.

      During and after each intervention, both the rate and extent of magnitude changes in
      voluntary and involuntary motor response behaviors will be compared between interventions
      within participants. Repeated measurements will be collected on all subjects that
      participate in the multiple interventions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age 18 and 77 years (the latter to reduce likelihood of heart disease)

          -  medical clearance to participate

          -  lesion at or below C2 and above T12 with non-progressive etiology

          -  classified as motor-incomplete with visible volitional leg movement

          -  injury greater than 1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent severe medical illness (i.e., infection, cardiovascular disease,
             ossification, recurrent autonomic dysreflexia, unhealed decubiti, and history of
             pulmonary complications)

          -  Pregnant women because of the unknown affects of AIH on pregnant women and fetus

          -  History of seizures, brain injury, and/or epilepsy

          -  Diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The existence of severe OSA
             during non-rapid eye movement sleep may be suggestive of pulmonary obstructions, a
             potential confound for this study. Subjects will be monitored for breathing patterns
             during sleep for one night to assess for symptoms of OSA. A portable sleep-screening
             tool [ApneaLink, USA] that records up to 10 continuous hours of heart rate,
             respiration, and SaO2 will be used to screen potential subjects. Those persons with
             an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), corresponding to a combined number of apneas and
             hypopneas that occur per hour of sleep, of greater than 30 will be excluded
