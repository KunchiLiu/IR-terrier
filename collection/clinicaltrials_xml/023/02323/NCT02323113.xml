    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 1b dose finding phase is to determine the safety, tolerability, and
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-659 in patients with
      relapsed or refractory AML. The purpose of the Phase 2 expansion phase is to evaluate
      preliminary efficacy of TAK-659 in relapsed or refractory AML as measured by overall
      response rate (ORR).

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659. TAK-659 is being tested to treat
      people who have relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This study will be
      conducted in 2 phases. The first phase will determine a safe and well-tolerated dose of
      TAK-659 to be used in the second phase, and the second phase will look at response to
      treatment in people who take TAK-659.

      The study will enroll approximately 81 patients (up to 15 in the first phase and 66 in the
      second phase). There will be two separate cohorts during Phase 2 portion of the study, one
      for patients with FLT-3 ITD mutations and the other for FLT-3 wild-type patients.

      Phase 1b:

      • TAK-659 60 mg tablet starting dose escalated in 20 mg or higher increments to a maximum
      tolerated dose or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)

      Phase 2:

      • TAK-659 tablet at the maximum tolerated dose or RP2D determined in Phase 1b. All
      participants will be asked to take their prescribed tablets at the same time each day
      throughout the study.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time
      to participate in this study is up to 24 months (12 months of treatment and 12 months of
      follow up) unless the treating physician believes the participant would continue to derive
      benefit from the study drug.

    <description>An AE is considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events. AEs will be recorded from first dose of study drug through 28 days after the last dose of study drug or to the start of anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first.
A SAE is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. SAEs will be reported from signing of informed consent form through 28 days after the last dose of study drug even if the patient starts nonprotocol therapy.</description>

                  usual lifestyle of the subject.

             (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods]
             and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) b. Male participants,
