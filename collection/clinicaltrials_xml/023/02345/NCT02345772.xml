    <description>Hormonal therapy with fulvestrant 500 mg will be administered intramuscularly on days 1, 15 of the first cycle, and thereafter on day 1 of every 28-day cycle for up to 5 cycles before surgery.
Docetaxel (T) 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks will be given for four cycles. Trastuzumab (H, 8mg/kg for 1st cycle, then 6 mg/kg in subsequent cycles before and after surgery), pertuzumab (P, 840 mg for 1st cycle, then 420 mg in subsequent 3 cycles) will be given concurrently with docetaxel for a total of 4 cycles before surgery.
Note:
1 cycle of chemotherapy is defined as 21 days. Hormonal therapy cycle is every 28 days
It is recommended, but not mandatory to give pegfilgrastim 6 mg subcutaneously the day after chemotherapy with docetaxel.
Appropriate surgery will be performed 3-6 weeks after completion of last cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.</description>
