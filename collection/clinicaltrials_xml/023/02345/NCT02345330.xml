      This study will assess the safety and effectiveness of intratumoral plasmid interleukin-12
      DNA injection (pIL-12) with electroporation (EP) in treatment-refractory metastatic and
      unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Intratumoral pIL-12 EP is
      a gene therapy approach to directly induce a pro-inflammatory response within a tumor to
      initiate and/or enhance anti-tumor immunity.
