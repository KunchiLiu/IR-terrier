      Subjects will participate in the study for up to 168 days. Up to 20 subjects will be
      enrolled in the study.

      Subjects will self-administer study medication as subcutaneous (SC) injections in the
      abdomen (preferably) twice per day; the first dose each day should be administered in the
      morning and the evening dose should be administered within 8 to 16 hours after the morning
      dose.

      Safety assessments will be conducted at each study visit during treatment and AEs will be
      collected throughout the Treatment period and during the 56-days observation period visits.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The following is a abbreviated list of Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Definite retinal thickening due to RVO involving the central macula based on
             Investigator's clinical evaluation and demonstrated by sdOCT.

          -  Mean central subfield thickness of at least 300 µm by sdOCT with presence of
             intraretinal fluid

          -  ETDRS BCVA letter score ≤ 76 and ≥ 24.

          -  Decrease in vision determined to be primarily the result of macular dema due to RVO
             and not due to other causes.

        The following is a abbreviated list of Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than RVO

          -  Any other ocular disease that may cause substantial reduction in visual acuity,
             including iris neovascularization, retinal detachment, epiretinal membrane, vitreous
             hemorrhage or fibrosis, ocular inflammation (uveitis), retinal inflammatory,
             infectious disease, or primary open-angle glaucoma.

          -  High myopia (-8 diopter or more correction).

          -  History of idiopathic or autoimmune uveitis.

          -  History of any ocular surgery within 3 months prior to Day 1.

          -  History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) or focal laser within 3 months
             prior to Day 1.

          -  History of prior intravitreal, subtenon, or periocular steroid therapy within 3
             months prior to Day 1 (e.g., triamcinolone).

          -  History of prior treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment within 16 weeks
             prior to Day 1.
