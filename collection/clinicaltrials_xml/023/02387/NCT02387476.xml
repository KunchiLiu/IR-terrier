      This will be a prospective study in subjects with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) to
      characterize the clinical performance during a single night of therapy with a FRESCA mask
      compared with a single night of therapy with their existing nasal Continuous Positive Airway
      Pressure (CPAP) mask.

    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common chronic disorder and the most common of all sleep
      disorders. OSA can occur in any age group, but prevalence increases between middle and older
      age. Over the last two decades the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing seems to be
      increasing in both men and women, likely due to increasing rates of obesity. Relative
      increases reported are between 14% and 55% depending on the subgroup. For men, the current
      prevalence estimates of moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing are 10% for 30 to 49
      year-olds and 17% for 50 to 70 year-olds. For women, the corresponding prevalence estimates
      are 3% and 9%.

      Common consequences of OSA include daytime sleepiness, extreme daytime fatigue, slow
      reaction time, moodiness, belligerence and vision problems. OSA is also linked to
      hypertension, increased cardiovascular morbidity, type 2 diabetes, neurocognitive
      dysfunction and possibly cancer.

      The study is a prospective, comparative, open label, randomized crossover assignment,
      multi-center pivotal study.

      Up to forty-five (45) subjects will be enrolled. It is desirable to have the subject
      population distributed across the OSA severity criteria range.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the FRESCA mask is non-inferior to a CPAP
      nasal mask in maintaining AHI and ODI during a single night of PSG assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female 18-70 years old;

          2. Qualifying diagnostic polysomnography (PSG): Resulting in AHI &gt; 5/hr of sleep (using
             conventional lab or home test);

          3. Qualifying titration PSG: In lab titration within the past 12 months and therapeutic
             pressure resulting in Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) &lt; 5/hr;

          4. Primary medical diagnosis of OSA/ Hypopnea syndrome and on CPAP treatment &gt; 1 month;

          5. Current user of nasal mask or nasal pillow mask;

          6. Have regular usage of their CPAP machine ( at least 4 hrs per night and at least 5
             nights per week) confirmed by secure digital (SD) card download;

          7. No significant changes in the subject's general health and no change in weight
             greater than ±10 lbs since titration PSG was performed and CPAP therapy initiated
             (confirmed from medical records);
