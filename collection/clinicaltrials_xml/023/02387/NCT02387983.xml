      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of oral
      posaconazole tablets in Chinese participants at high risk for invasive fungal infections.
      Neutropenic participants undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia or
      myelodysplastic syndromes will be enrolled in the study.
