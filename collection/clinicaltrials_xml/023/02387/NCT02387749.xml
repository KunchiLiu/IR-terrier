    <textblock>
      A debilitating consequence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is neuropathy which globally affects
      between 20 -30% of diabetic patients and up to 50% in other studies. The incidence of
      diabetic neuropathy (DN) is estimated to be up to 45% for type 2 diabetic patients and 59%
      for type 1diabetic patients in USA.(DN) is the most common complication of DM. The risk of
      DN rises with age, duration of DM, and vascular disease. It is Characterized by damages in
      the arms and legs. The pathophysiology of DN is promoted by several risk factors: micro
      vascular disease, neural hypoxia, and hyperglycemia-induced effects At the molecular level,
      the primary cause of diabetic complications is known to be hyperglycemia, which disrupts
      cellular metabolism by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).In the aspect of nerve
      functions, ROS formation increases neuron's susceptibility to damage. In addition,
      hyperglycemia impedes production of angiogenic and neurotrophic growth factors, which are
      necessary for normal function of neurons and glial cells and maintenance of vascular
      structure .The most common presentation of nerve damage due to the effects of hyperglycemia
      is neuropathic pain. (DN)may cause foot deformities such as hammertoes and unnoticed sores
      and infections in the numb areas of the foot. Improperly treated infection frequently
      extends to the bone and requires amputation of the foot.No definitive disease-modifying
      treatments have been to reverse DN. The current treatment focuses on tight glycemic control
      which can reduce potential risk factors for further nerve damage and DN-associated pain
      management. In many studies, deficiency of neurotrophic factors and lack of vascular support
      have been regarded as key factors in the development DN .Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are
      particularly attractive therapeutic agents because of their ability to self-renew,
      differentiate into multi lineage cell types , and locally secrete angiogenic cytokines,
      including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) .These factors were reported to prompt neovascularization and have support for neural
      regeneration.MSC transfusion was reported to be a therapeutic agent in the treatment of
      Cardiovascular disease. Similarly, it was plausible that MSCs may also be an effective
      therapeutic agent for the DN treatment through the paracrine effects of bFGF (Shibata et
      al., 2008) and VEGF and their potential to differentiate into neural cells such as
      astrocytes, oligodendrocytes , and Schwann cells.The adherent nature of MSCs makes them easy
      to expand in culture and an attractive candidate to use in cell therapy. Also, MSCs are
      particularly attractive therapeutic agents because of their ability to self-renew,
      differentiate into multi lineage cell types, and locally secrete angiogenic cytokines,
      including (bFGF) and VEGF. Therefore, cell therapy has recently emerged as an attractive
      therapeutic strategy to meet the needs of both neurotrophic and vascular deficiencies of
      DN.In electrodiagnostic studies, nerve conduction velocity and magnitude are measured by
      electrically stimulating nerves. Proper diagnosis of DN depends on the pattern of sensory
      loss, reflex test, electrodiagnostic studies, and imaging

             -  fundus examination

             -  Nerve conduction study at neurophysiology unit.

             -  Bone marrow aspiration of about 90 ml under local anesthesia once at the first
                visit after preparatory visit mentioned before, the patient will be admitted for
                12 hours and will be monitored closely to avoid anaphylaxis (by steroids,
                anti-allergic treatment), if no complication, will be discharged.

      To avoid infection: During bone marrow aspiration, procedure will be done under complete
      aseptic precautions, placed in sterile tubes containing pre-servative-free heparin
      (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) Separation and processing of the sample will be done under
      good manufacture procedure (GMP): Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMA) will be withdrawn under good
      sterilization of the skin in an isolated area. Processing of the sample will be done in the
      laminar air flow; all supplies are disposable and sterile.

      Technique:

      Separation of mononuclear cells:

      The bone marrow aspirate will be diluted at a ratio of 6:1 with phosphate buffer saline
      (PBS) with 2 mM EDTA (30 ml BM aspirate+ 5 ml PBS/EDTA buffer). The MNCs will be separated
      under aseptic conditions using a Ficoll. Hypaque desity gradient (density 1.077, GibcoBRL,
      Grand Islan, NY, USA) by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 20 min then the MNCs will be plated
      in 40 ml alpha-modi-field Eagle's medium (αMEM), serum free media; mesencult(Mesenchymal
      stem cell culture),penicillin (100 U/ml),streptomycin(10 mg/ml),0.5 ml amphotericin B(all
      from Gibco BRL) and 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) (R&amp;D system,
      Minneapolis, MN) and will be incubated at 370 c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2
      (Digirolamo et al.1999).after one day ,non adherent cells will be cultured in the presence
      of Mesenchymal media for 3 weeks changed every 1 week (cambrex Bioscience ,Nottingham, uk).
      After reaching 80% confluence the MSCs will be placed in 10 ml saline and will be infused
      intravenously

      Flow cytometry Surface expression of MSCs using anti- (CD271, CD34, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD29)
      monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) will be analyzed using flow cytometry. MSCs (2X105 cells) will
      be suspended in PBS containing 1% BSA and will be stained with flurochrome -conjugated mAbs
      for 20 minutes on ice (anti-mouse mAanti-CD 271, CD34 CD73, CD90, CD105,CD29; BD Bioscience,
      MN, USA).flow cytometric analysis will be performed using a FACSCaliber (BD
      bioscience)equipped with cell Quest software.10000 cells will be passed in front of the
      laser for each sample. Each sample will be analyzed in duplicate. A cut off value at 20%
      will be set to categorize samples as positive.

      Mesenchymal stem cells will be identified by morphology and immunophenotyping in the central
      lab at clinical pathology department, Kasr Alaini hospital( stem cell lab).

      Mesenchymal stem cells transfusion slowly intravenous will be applied after these procedures
      for the patients after taking their approval and informed consent.

      Follow up 3 months after Mesenchymal stem cells transfusion by fasting blood glucose level,
      2 hours postprandial, C-peptide, Hb A1C, (bFGF), (VEGF) and nerve conduction at kasr Alaini
      hospital departments as mentioned before.

      Possible Risk (mention if there is any risk or not) Anaphylaxis Infection
