      This study in patients with IBS-C is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group clinical trial with 12 weeks of study drug therapy.

      Screening/Baseline: Patients will undergo an up to 28-day Screening/Baseline period to allow
      for any necessary diagnostic procedures, allow for required washout of medications and to
      determine study eligibility. If otherwise eligible based on screening criteria, patients
      will undergo a 2-week baseline assessment using an electronic diary where they will record
      daily assessments of bowel movements (BMs), stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form
      Scale-BSFS), abdominal pain and other IBS-related symptoms. Data from the two-week
      electronic diary assessment just prior to the randomization visit will be used to confirm
      IBS-C and study eligibility as well as define the patient's baseline from which change will
      be determined.

      Treatment: Patients who meet all entry criteria will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of three
      blinded treatment groups on Day 1 of the Treatment period. Patients will take an oral dose
      of study drug OD for 12 weeks and continue the daily electronic diaries (BMs, rescue
      medication use, abdominal pain, and other symptoms). During treatment weeks 4, 8, and 12,
      patients will return to the clinic to undergo safety and efficacy assessments.

      Post-Treatment: For 2 weeks after completing dosing, patients will continue to complete
      daily electronic diaries. Patients will then return to the clinical site for a final
      follow-up visit during Week 14 following randomization.

      The planned duration of participation in this study will be at least 116 days from signing
      of informed consent through post-treatment or up to approximately 135 days with visit
      windows considered.
