    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well sonidegib and buparlisib work in treating patients with
      basal cell carcinoma that has spread to other places in the body. Sonidegib and buparlisib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of sonidegib (erismodegib) in combination
      with buparlisib (hereby referred to as &quot;LB therapy&quot;) for patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in Smoothened inhibitor naive patients (Cohort 1) and
      those whose disease is refractory or relapsed on Smoothened inhibitor monotherapy (Cohort
      2).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the median duration of response, on or after LB therapy. II. To assess the
      safety and tolerability of LB therapy. III. To assess the histopathologic effect of LB
      therapy in tumor biopsies obtained at baseline and following 12 weeks of treatment.

      IV. To assess the effect of LB therapy on gene expression including Hedgehog pathway and
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways.

      V. To assess correlation between gene mutations in Smoothened, suppressor of fused homolog
      (Sufu), patched (PTCH), glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli)1,2 and gene expression
      profiles and response to LB therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and buparlisib PO QD on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months.

             may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered
             effective for this study; women of child-bearing potential, defined as sexually
             mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (ie, who has had menses any time in
             the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum pregnancy test =&lt; 72
             hours prior to initiating treatment

               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they

                  clinical profile (eg, age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
                  levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL (for US only: and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL) or have had surgical
                  bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago; in
                  the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman
                  has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not
                  of child bearing potential

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable
                  of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study
                  and through 20 months after the final dose of study treatment; for males with
                  partners with childbearing potential, highly effective contraception is required
                  for 6 months; the highly effective contraception is defined as either:

                    -  True abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                       lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation,
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                       methods of contraception

                    -  Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                       hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago; in case of
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); for female
                       subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole
                       partner for that patient

                    -  Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):

                         -  a. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system
                            (IUS)

                         -  b. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap
                            (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
                            foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

               -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed

               -  Fertile males, must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of
                  contraception (eg, spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the
                  study, and continuing using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for
                  6 months following the study drug; a condom is required to be used also by
                  vasectomized men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to
                  prevent delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid; female partner of
                  male study subject should use highly effective contraception during dosing of
                  any study agent and for 16 weeks after final dose of study therapy

               -  Note: hormonal contraception methods (eg, oral, injected, implanted) are not
                  allowed

               -  Note: woman are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential if
                  they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (eg, age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol
