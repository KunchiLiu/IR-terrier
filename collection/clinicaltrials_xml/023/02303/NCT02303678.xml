      This is a Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of D2C7-IT (D2C7
      Immunotoxin) when delivered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to
      recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III (dose escalation only) and IV (dose
      escalation and dose expansion) malignant glioma patients, and to determine what dose will be
      considered in a single-arm Phase II trial. Patients with recurrent WHO grade III (dose
      escalation only) and IV (dose escalation and dose expansion) malignant glioma who meet
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study. Immediately following
      stereotactically-guided tumor biopsy, subjects will have catheters inserted. If the frozen
      section of the biopsy indicates a proven diagnosis of recurrent malignant glioma (diagnosis
      results are typically received within 24-48 hours following biopsy), the investigators will
      proceed with the D2C7-IT infusion. If not, the catheters will be removed. A continuous
      intratumoral infusion of D2C7-IT will be administered and the same total flow rate for all
      catheters will be set at 0.5 ml/hour per catheter for 72 hours.

      This is a Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of D2C7-IT, when
      delivered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) following confirmatory
      diagnostic biopsy in recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III and IV malignant
      glioma patients, and to determine what dose will be considered in a phase II trial.

      A two-stage continual reassessment method (CRM) design will be used to determine the MTD of
      D2C7-IT where the first stage involves dose escalation in successive patients until an
      initial dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. Within the second stage, all accumulated
      data will be used within the context of a one-parameter logistic model to determine the
      appropriate dose for each subsequent patient. Maximum likelihood estimation will be used.
      This modeling process will determine the dose with a DLT rate closest to the target DLT rate
      of 0.25. Cohorts of 2 patients will be accrued to this study within both stages of the
      trial. The first patient of each cohort will be observed through the completion of the
      D2C7-IT infusion, before additional patients in that cohort are treated.

      Once the optimal dose level of D2C7-IT is determined (dose escalation completed), a total of
      27 recurrent patients with WHO grade IV malignant glioma patients will be treated at that
      dose level as a dose expansion cohort.

      Patients diagnosed with recurrent malignant glioma based on radiographic evidence may be
      enrolled onto the study prior to biopsy. The clinically approved BrainLab iPlan Flow
      (BrainLAB AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) planning station software will be used for the biopsy
      and catheter placement based on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In brief, the simulation of
      the spread of a drug or tracer molecule is computed by an FDA-approved computer algorithm
      based on the standard equations presented by Morrison et al, using data derived from MR
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and dynamic contrasted enhanced (DCE) imaging that provides
      information useful in the determination of (i) advection (convection), (ii) diffusion and
      (iii) loss from the interstitium due to both clearance due to the vasculature and metabolism
      or degradation. Up to four intratumoral catheters will be placed in areas at greatest risk
      for infiltrating disease and in any solid-contrast-enhancing disease. Catheter placement
      will be based on the BrainLab software. A computed tomography (CT) scan will be used to
      confirm catheter placement postoperatively. Catheters found by postoperative CT scanning to
      be improperly placed may be replaced or removed. If frozen section of the biopsy indicates a
      proven diagnosis of recurrent WHO Grade III or IV malignant glioma (diagnosis results are
      typically received within 24-48 hours following biopsy), the investigators will proceed with
      D2C7-IT infusion. If not, the catheters will be removed. Molecular genetic tests, such as,
      but not limited to, DNA sequencing, gene amplification, and gene expression, will be
      performed on the tissue obtained at biopsy. The goal of these molecular genetic tests is to
      identify genetic predictors of response or failure of response to treatment with D2C7-IT.

      A continuous intratumoral infusion of D2C7-IT will be administered in the Neurosciences Step
      down unit at Duke. Based on our own experience, previously published reports by Laske, et al
      (1997)31, and Institutional Review Board (IRB)- and FDA-approved trials using similar
      infusion techniques, patients will be infused at a rate of 0.5 ml/hour. The same total flow
      rate for all catheters will be set at 0.5 ml/hour per catheter for 72 hours. Up to a total
      volume of 144 mL will be administered.

      Patients who are taking (and are stable on) less than or equal to 4 mg per day of
      dexamethasone (i.e. low-dose corticosteroid) within the 2 weeks prior to admission for
      D2C7-IT infusion (i.e. patients who meet the relevant eligibility criterion) may continue on
      this dose. Patients taking corticosteroids for other medical indications (e.g., asthma or
      skin condition) will be advised to continue use of these medications. Any neurologic
      findings which prompt an increase in the corticosteroid dose will be documented as Adverse
      Events. Seizure prophylaxis will be administered to all patients prior to, during, after the
      infusion and afterward. Seizure prophylaxis may be administered to patients prior to,
      during, and after the infusion at the discretion of the treating neuro-surgeon. Prophylactic
      antiepileptic medication may also be continued until the visit 1 month post infusion. Choice
      of antiepileptic medication and discontinuation of medication after the visit 1 month post
      infusion will be left at the discretion of the neurosurgeon or neuro-oncologist. Any
      neurologic findings which prompt an increase in the antiepileptic medication dose will be
      documented as an Adverse Event. This study limits the administration of high-dose
      corticosteroids due to concerns that high-dose corticosteroids might negatively impact the
      efficacy of D2C7-IT. Specifically, high-dose corticosteroids may be administered on a
      limited basis to patients prior to, during, or after D2C7-IT infusion only when determined
      to be medically necessary.

      Gd-DTPA (gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid) will be co-infused along with the
      D2C7-IT to monitor infusate distribution. MR mages will be obtained within 24-30 hours of
      the start of the infusion and 0 to 6 hours after the end of the infusion, before catheter
      removal, to monitor volume of drug distribution.

      The radiographic imaging performed after catheter placement, during and at the completion of
      infusion, will also be used as a safety measure for toxicity monitoring to determine the
      degree of leakage into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient will remain in the
      hospital during the entire infusion. At the completion of the infusion, the catheters will
      be removed within 6 hours and a CT scan will be obtained after the catheters are pulled. The
      patient will be observed in hospital for a minimum of another 6 hours.

      Blood will be drawn to determine if an immune response to tumor antigens is generated by the
      D2C7-IT infusion. Following D2C7-IT infusion, subjects will be evaluated in clinic at 2
      weeks for adverse events and followed at 4 and 8 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter until 48
      weeks or disease progression, whichever occurs first, for adverse events, radiographic
      response, and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and cognitive function (8-week,
      16-week, 32-week, and 48-week assessments only). No other treatment intervention is
      allowable while on study. Subjects will come off study when progressive disease is
      documented. If alternative anti-tumor therapy is initiated or patient undergoes a surgical
      procedure due to disease progression, the date and type of therapy/surgery must be
      documented; however, subjects will be off study when progressive disease is documented.
      Subjects will be followed for survival and imaging, if available.
