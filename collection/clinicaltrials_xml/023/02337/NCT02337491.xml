      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine the effectiveness of
      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) when given with bevacizumab or when given alone for the treatment of
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This study will also test the safety and
      tolerability of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) when given alone or with bevacizumab.

      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of
      protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance. Antibodies attack foreign
      substances and protect against infection. Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory
      for use in treating patients, an antibody that is made in the lab is also known as a
      humanized monoclonal antibody. There are now several approved antibodies for the therapy of
      cancer and other disease. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has been studied in lab experiments and in
      other types of cancer. Information from these studies suggests that Pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      may be beneficial in your type of cancer.

      Bevacizumab, also known as Avastin, is approved by the FDA for treating recurrent GBM.
      Bevacizumab is an anti-angiogenic medicine, which means it blocks blood vessels from forming
      that could supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen.

      If you participate in this study, you will then be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of two study
      groups; Cohort A or Cohort B. Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance.
      It is like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the research doctor will choose what group you
      will be in. You have an approximately 60% chance of being placed in to Cohort A and an
      approximately 40% chance of being placed into Cohort B. Study Groups:

        -  Cohort A: study drug, Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) + bevacizumab

        -  Cohort B: Study drug, Pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
