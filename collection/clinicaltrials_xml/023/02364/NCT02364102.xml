      The investigators aim to study whether hypothyroidism negatively affects Brown adipose
      tissue (BAT) function in humans and whether BAT function can be restored to normal by
      thyroid hormone supplementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothyroidism is a frequent endocrine disorder, the prevalence of subclinical disease being
      4.3% and of overt disease being 0.3%. Patients suffering from hypothyroidism frequently
      complain of increased cold sensitivity and involuntary weight gain, indicating changes in
      energy expenditure and response to cold challenge.

      Recently, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has regained attention as an energy expending tissue.
      While it was previously thought to be of no or negligible relevance in human adults, recent
      studies clearly demonstrated the presence and metabolic activity of BAT in human adults.
      Upon activation of BAT by the sympathetic nervous system intracellular lipid stores are
      rapidly depleted. The generated free fatty acids fuel beta-oxidation and the respiratory
      chain within the mitochondria and activate at the same time uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).
      This protein acts as a protonophore, allowing the flux of protons along the electrochemical
      gradient into the inner mitochondrial matrix instead of transferring their energy to
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-synthase. The short circuiting of the oxidative phosphorylation
      within the mitochondria leads to highly active cellular respiration and generation of heat.
      Basic research highlights the importance of thyroid hormone in the development and function
      of BAT.

      It has recently been shown that hyperthyroidism exerts activating effects on BAT in adult
      humans.

      The investigators aim to study whether hypothyroidism negatively affects BAT function in
      humans and whether BAT function can be restored to normal by thyroid hormone
      supplementation.
