  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional pilot study investigating the feasibility of using the hand of
      hope (HOH) device for individuals with decreased hand function after stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HOH will be used to provide hand training for patients with decreased hand ability after
      stroke. The HOH is a light-weight, non-invasive, portable hand robot that provides physical
      assistance when a patient activates the muscles that open and close the hand. The HOH works
      by detecting surface EMG muscle activity and therefore requires active participation from
      the patient throughout the session. Video games linked to the HOH device are specifically
      designed to work on opening and closing the hand facilitating mass practice and high
      repetition needed for improving strength and range of motion of muscles.

    <description>Subjects will receive arm training 3x/week for 6 weeks, each session is anticipated to last approximately 60 minutes. Sessions will be scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday whenever possible to provide a rest period between sessions. Each session will consist of the following:
warm up-passive stretch of hand in flexion and extension (5 minutes);
setting the EMG threshold parameters for the device;
active practicing of opening the hand (Desperate Bee, Hungry Bird, Sun Archer games; 10 min)
active practice of closing then hand (UFO Catcher game; 10 min)
open and closing the hand (Ball and Basket game; 10 min)
open and closing the hand while incorporating reach ( for subjects with adequate ability to reach with shoulder/elbow; 10 min)
cool down-passive stretch of hand in flexion and extension (5 minutes)</description>
