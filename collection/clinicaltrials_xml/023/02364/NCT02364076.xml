  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized clinical trial in patients with thymic carcinomas who failed prior
      systemic therapy. All subjects will receive MK-3475 treatment intravenously once every three
      weeks until unacceptable toxicity, death, progressive disease or withdrawal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of MK-3475 in thymic carcinoma patients after at least one prior
      chemotherapy regimen. Exploratory studies will be performed on archival tumor material
      (PDL-1 expression, next-generation sequencing) and fresh biopsies (culturing,
      next-generation sequencing).

      Simon's two-stage optimal design is used. The null hypothesis that the true response rate is
      5% will be tested against a one-sided alternative. In the first stage 9 subjects will be
      accrued. If there is no response in these 9 subjects, the study will be stopped. Otherwise,
      8 additional subjects will be accrued for a total of 17. The null hypothesis will be
      rejected if 3 or more responses are seen in 17 subjects.
