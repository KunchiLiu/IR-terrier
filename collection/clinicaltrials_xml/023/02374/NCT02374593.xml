    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study comparing targeted levothyroxine dosing based on thyroid anatomy as
      visualized on ultrasound (normal vs. ectopic/sublingual vs. athyreosis) to empiric
      levothyroxine dosing in infants with congenital hypothyroidism. Patients enrolled in the
      study for targeted dosing will be compared to controls obtained by retrospective chart
      review. The main outcome is to determine if there is a difference in the frequency of
      over-treatment and under-treatment during the first 6 months of therapy.

    <description>Thyroid labs (TSH and fT4/T4) will be monitored per standard care: 2 weeks after initiation of levothyroxine and once monthly during the first 6 months of treatment. The time when the patient reaches normal labs with a stable levothyroxine dose will be noted.</description>
