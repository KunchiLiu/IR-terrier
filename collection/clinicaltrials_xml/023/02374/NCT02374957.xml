    <textblock>
      Twenty patients will be recruited to CLEAR. Ten will be randomized to the treatment arm
      (Cilostazol) and tenwill be randomized to the control group. Patients randomized to the
      treatment arm will receive Cilostazol for 90 days. The primary purpose of this study is to
      collect quality of life data on patients undergoing peripheral revascularization in order to
      determine the sample size required to adequately power a trial of Cilostazol versus usual
      care without Cilostazol and its effect on quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cilostazol is the only medication approved for use in peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
      patients to reduce claudication symptoms. Contemporary data has demonstrated that Cilostazol
      improves patency after endovascular interventions in multiple randomized trials and
      retrospective studies done in Japan in both critical limb ischemia and claudication
      patients. However, Cilostazol use after peripheral revascularization has been sporadic and
      there has been no research to estimate patient quality of life with use of Cilostazol after
      open or endovascular lower extremity revascularization.

      This is a prospective investigator initiated single-center open-label, non-placebo
      controlled pilot study. Eligible patients would be randomized to either the Cilostazol
      treatment or the non-Cilostazol treatment groups using a closed envelope randomization
      technique. Twenty patients will be recruited and randomized; Ten to the treatment group and
      tento the control group.

      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to collect quality of life data on patients
      undergoing peripheral revascularization in order to determine the sample size required for
      adequate powered trial of Cilostazol versus usual care without Cilostazol and its effect on
      Quality of Life.
