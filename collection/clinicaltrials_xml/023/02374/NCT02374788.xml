  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of two levels of primary care physical
      activity interventions on metabolic control and cardiovascular risk factors, compared to
      usual care in patients with pre- and type 2 diabetes.

      The hypothesis is that both levels of interventions have effect on HbA1c with the more
      intense Group intervention having superior effects.

      Regularly physical activity may decrease the risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
      diseases, overweight and premature deaths. Despite the evidence that physical activity is
      beneficial to health,it is often ignored and underused aspect in diabetes care. The aim of
      the study is to investigate the effects of two levels of primary care physical activity
      interventions on metabolic control and cardiovascular risk factors, compared to usual care
      in patients with pre- and type 2 diabetes.

    <description>Participants in the intensive intervention group (A) receive a pedometer intervention and 12 group meetings over two years' time, with the majority of meetings being held in the first 6 months. The group meetings constitutes of a 30 min walk and 60 min group consulting based on techniques for behaviour change using an interactive program with positive feed-back following their steps on a website. One occasion is taking place at a gym with instruction for a home-based strength training program. Participants receive 10 individual consultations with a diabetes specialist nurse.</description>
