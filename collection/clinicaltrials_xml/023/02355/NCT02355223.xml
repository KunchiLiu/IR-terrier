  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the clinical impact of a novel strategy for tuberculosis
      (TB) infection control known as FAST (Find cases Actively based on cough surveillance,
      Separate temporarily, and Treat effectively). It is anticipated that this will decrease time
      to effective treatment initiation and also decrease transmission of TB to health care
      workers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is longstanding evidence that tuberculosis (TB) transmission is not from TB patients
      on effective treatment, but from unsuspected cases, and cases with unsuspected drug
      resistance. This study seeks to investigate the implementation of a refocused TB
      transmission control approach that we call FAST (Find cases Actively based on cough
      surveillance, Separate temporarily, and Treat effectively based on molecular
      drug-susceptibility testing [DST]). We will conduct this study at Hospital Nacional Hipólito
      Unanue in Lima, Peru. Our hypothesis is that FAST will reduce delays in identifying
      infectious TB patients (and unsuspected drug resistance) entering the hospital, facilitate
      timely effective therapy, and thereby reduce the risk of TB transmission in a cost-effective
      manner. We will assess the decrease in transmission by evaluating for a decrease tuberculin
      skin test conversions (TST) among health care workers. We will also evaluate acceptability
      and barriers to/facilitators of FAST, novel screening strategies, and health care worker TST
      using a mixed methods approach.

    <description>This single center study will consist of introducing a TB screening program called FAST (Find cases Actively, Separate safely, and Treat Effectively) within the hospital among patients presenting for care who have 2 or more weeks of cough, and testing them for tuberculosis using a combination of rapid screening and diagnostics tools. The study will evaluate the process of implementation as well as the impact on reducing tuberculosis transmission to health care workers over successive years.</description>
