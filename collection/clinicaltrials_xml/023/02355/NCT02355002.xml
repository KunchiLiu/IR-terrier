  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) over the pre-supplementary motor area as a treatment for obsessive
      compulsive disorder. Additionally, this study aims to identify the mechanisms of action of
      TMS and potential biomarkers and predictors of treatment response.

    <arm_group_label>Sham treatment</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm serves as the sham/placebo control. In TMS a sham coil is used to create a sensory experience which is similar to active TMS, but in which the magnetic field is blocked by a metal shield built into the coil.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation uses a rapidly changing magnetic field to induce current in brain tissue non-invasively. It is common procedure in both clinical and research settings, and it has well established guidelines for safe an ethical use which maximize safety for all subjects. See attached Rossi et. al. 2009 as a reference to safety guidelines for TMS.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or history of neurologic or psychiatric disease (e.g., mental retardation,
             dementia, brain damage, or other cognitive impairment) that would interfere with
             ability to engage in TMS

          2. Psychopathology not appropriate for the treatment (e.g., manic episode or psychosis)

          3. Substance abuse or dependence that is current or within the last six months or use of
             an illicit drug that is not prescribed, as indicated by a urine drug screen and/or
             clinical inference.

          4. Use of benzodiazepines or anticonvulsants within 2 weeks prior to study (to be ruled
             out by a urine drug screen).

          5. Use of Tricyclic Antidepressants (e.g. Clomipramine).

          6. Use of other psychotropic medications (e.g., SSRIs) will be allowed provided the dose
             has been stable for &gt; 12 weeks.

          7. Documented resistance to 4 or more valid pharmacological trials of 2 or more
             different medication classes (e.g. SSRIs and TCAs).

          8. Previous exposure to TMS.

          9. Major/chronic medical conditions.

         10. History of head injury resulting in prolonged loss of consciousness and/or
             neurological sequelae.

         11. Prior neurosurgical procedure.

         12. Metal in the body, metal injury to the eyes.

         14. Implanted pacemaker, medication pump, vagal stimulator, deep brain stimulator, TENS
             unit, or ventriculo-peritoneal shunt

         15. Pregnancy; breastfeeding or nursing; for women of childbearing a pregnancy test (to
             be ruled out by urine β-HCG) will be conducted prior to study.

         16. Currently in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

         17. Diagnosis of primary sleep disorder such as primary insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep
             apnea, shift work sleep disorder and others. Sleep disorders such as insomnia or
             hypersomnia that are secondary to depression or OCD are permitted.
