  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 84 successive days of topically
      administered LHA510 compared to vehicle in reducing the number of patients requiring
      intravitreal (IVT) anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (Lucentis®) for
      recurrence of active choroidal neovascularization (CNV).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for recurrence of active CNV is an IVT injection of an anti-VEGF agent.
      In this study, recurrence of CNV will be treated exclusively with IVT Lucentis®. On Day -1,
      patients will receive an IVT Lucentis® injection, and then will be randomized to receive
      either topical LHA510 ophthalmic suspension or vehicle in a 1:1 ratio.
