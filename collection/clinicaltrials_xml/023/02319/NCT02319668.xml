  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the effect of two week pre-surgical
      rinsing with an antimicrobial mouthrinse containing 0.2% w/v Chlorhexidine digluconate on
      the total number of plaque bacteria in the mouth 3 days post implant surgery. The study will
      be conducted at Eastman Clinical Investigation Centre (ECIC), University College London
      (UCL) Eastman Dental Institute. Participants will be those who require a single and simple
      surgical implant to be placed, and will be recruited from new patient referrals within the
      Eastman Dental Hospital

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total number of detectable plaque bacteria sampled post implant surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner will identify three plaque sampling sites as, surgical site, contralateral site to the surgical site and tongue. An individual cotton swab will be used at each identified site for up to 20 seconds in order to harvest a plaque sample and will immediately be placed into 1mL phosphate buffered saline in a sterile Eppendorf tube. The samples will be analysed using two methods; qPCR and Next Generation Sequencing, that will determine the total number of bacteria in a sample by quantifying the number of 16S rRNA genes in the sample. Both techniques use the 16S rRNA gene as a target and either simply enumerate this via real time PCR or sequence c100,000 16S rRNA genes in each participant sample.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total number of detectable plaque bacteria sampled recoverable viable bacteria in an aerosol generated during a typical dental procedure (dental prophylaxis)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Thick (approx 10 millimetre (mm)) settle blood agar (supplemented with 5% (v/v) defibrinated horse blood) plates will be used to determine the bacterial load of the aerosol. Thirty minutes prior to the participants having their procedure (prophylaxis), a total of 5 settle plates with lids removed will be placed at set positions around the dental surgery. After 30 minutes, the settle plates will have their lids replaced. This will be repeated during the prophylaxis procedure using 5 fresh settle plates. All plates will then be sealed with parafilm and transported for incubation in an anaerobic chamber at 37°C for 3 days. The plates will be inspected daily to access growth and after 3 days removed and stored at 4°C for subsequent colony enumeration and Colony Forming Unit/mL (CFU/mL) calculation.</description>

    <description>The richness of bacteria will be determined using Next generation sequencing technique which will be performed on an Illumina (MiSeq) platform using the 16S rRNA gene as target</description>
