      This pilot, phase I trial studies the safety of cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1)-specific T
      cells (a type of immune cell) in treating patients with NY-ESO-1-expressing sarcomas that
      have spread to other places in the body and are receiving palliative (relief of symptoms and
      suffering caused by cancer) radiation therapy. Placing a modified gene for NY-ESO-1 into
      white blood cells may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells that
      express NY-ESO-1. Palliative radiation therapy may help patients with advanced sarcoma live
      more comfortably. Giving NY-ESO-1-specific T cells following palliative radiation therapy
      may be a better treatment for patients with sarcomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of NY-ESO-1-specific T cells when given following
      high-dose, hypo-fractionated palliative radiation to patients with advanced NY-ESO-1
      expressing sarcomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To look for preliminary evidence of systemic efficacy of NY-ESO-1-specific T-cell therapy
      following radiation on non-radiated tumors.

      II. To determine whether radiation increases trafficking of adoptively transferred
      NY-ESO-1-specific T cells by comparing tumor biopsy specimens from radiated and non-radiated
      tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo palliative radiation therapy at the discretion of the treating radiation
      oncologist. Patients then receive NY-ESO-1-specific T cells intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes 2-3 days after completion of radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 2 weeks, at 4-6, 8,
      10, and 12 weeks, and then for up to 6 months.

    <description>This is a composite outcome measure. Summary statistics used for describing changes across time. In addition, time course of biomarker outcomes investigated graphically, by summary plots or individual patient plots. Categorical data analyses and logistic regression used to evaluate the associations between correlative measures and clinical outcomes (e.g., response, clinical benefit, time to progression, progression-free survival, and survival). If there is suggestion of meaningful trend, methods such as linear mixed models may be used to characterize the pattern of change over time.</description>
