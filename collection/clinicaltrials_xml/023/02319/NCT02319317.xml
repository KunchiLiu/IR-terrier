  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a web-based intervention to
      prevent risky driving teen drivers licensed in the previous 90 days. The intervention will
      focus on promoting teen driver attention to the roadway.

      The investigators will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) experimental design for this
      feasibility study, randomizing to the intervention or control group. The investigators will
      complete a baseline assessment and follow up with participants at 1-month, 3-months and
      6-months post-intervention delivery.

      This study will provide information on the feasibility of the web-based intervention to
      prevent risky driving and estimation of effect size of the intervention on simulated driving
      performance, self-reported driving behaviors, crash and citation data.
