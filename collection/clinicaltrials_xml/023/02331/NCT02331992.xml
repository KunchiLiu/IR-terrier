  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disordered breathing condition effecting
      around 2-4% of the middle aged population and is characterized by periodic collapse of the
      upper airway during sleep. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the primary
      treatment for patients with OSA. Despite the effectiveness of CPAP in abolishing upper
      airway obstruction, acceptance of and adherence with therapy has been sub-optimal.

      Over the past decade, considerable research has focused on determining the factors
      responsible for poor CPAP adherence. Two key areas have been identified: patient-reported
      symptoms, including mask discomfort, pressure intolerance and nasal symptoms and the
      importance of patient education and support. In addition we know that the patient experience
      during the crucial first days and weeks of their journey predicts longer term adherence.

      This study investigates the ability of an automated program that assists patients towards
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy adherence.
