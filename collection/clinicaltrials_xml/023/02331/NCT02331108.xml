      To compart differences on the effect on core temperature between anesthetic induction with
      intravenous propofol versus inhalation induction with sevoflurane

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia occurs with anesthetic induction due to redistribution hypothermia. Hypothermia
      has adverse effects and should be avoided or minimized. Intravenous propofol induction is
      the most common technique used for anesthetic induction. There is preliminary evidence that
      there is less redistribution hypothermia when anesthetic induction is achieved by inhalation
      induction compared to intravenous induction. There is not enough data to compel a change in
      practice patterns. This study will enroll a larger number of patients in order to provide
      stronger evidence that there is a significant difference between induction techniques on
      body temperature. Patients will be randomly assigned to two variation of inhalation
      induction techniques and two variations of intravenous induction. The effect on temperature
      between the four groups will be compared. Reducing the degree of hypothermia has the
      potential to decrease surgical infection rate as well as providing other benefits to
      patients.
