    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and economical benefits of
      Cyclical Topical Wound Oxygen (TWO2) Therapy in the treatment of chronic diabetic foot
      ulcers. All subjects will wear a standardized off-loading device and use advanced moist
      wound therapy (AMWT) dressings. Half the subjects will use the TWO2 device, while the other
      half will use a sham device.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will use the TWO2/Sham device for 90 minutes a day at their home or nursing
      care facility 5 times a week for the treatment phase of up to 12 weeks. Monitoring of the
      wound will take place with weekly clinic visits for safety and compliance assessment and
      documentation. Wounds that close at or before 12 weeks will continue to use TWO2/sham
      device, off-loading and AMWT and have an additional to visits two weeks apart confirm wound
      closure. All subjects whether healed or not will enter a follow up period of an additional
      12 and 38 weeks.

      The maximum duration for participation in the trial is 54 weeks. During the follow-up phase,
      subjects will receive standard care according to the clinician's recommendation and will be
      asked not to participate in another wound care trial in this period.

    <description>Economic Analysis is a composite measure of the wound before the study (up to one year) and for the duration of the study. The assessment is obtained by documenting treatment history of the wound that includes types of dressings used, time taken for dressing changes, by whom dressings are changed, and type and duration of hospitalization as well as the administration of the EQ-5D questionnaire at the Baseline visit, weeks 4, 8 and 12 on treatment and 12 and 26 weeks post treatment.</description>
