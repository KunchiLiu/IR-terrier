  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B patients with normal ALT are not subjective to the therapeutic
      indication in EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, growing consensus on long-term
      risk of HBV infection with normal ALT are reached as more solid evidences are accumulated.
      Moreover, a large proportion of hepatitis B patients with normal ALT are at child-bearing
      age. Concerns about the impact of HBV on fetal and neonatal health become a psychological
      burden for them.

      Therefore, it is necessary to explore a regimen that can generate a rapid virological
      response, and a promising e antigen conversion rate, and safeguard the fetus.

      The pre-clinical study at our center found that the group had a rapid decrease of HBV DNA
      and a low recurrence rate after discontinuation of antiviral therapy with combined tenofovir
      and telbivudine (LdT + TDF) treatment.

      The current study is to use tenofovir and telbivudine jointly in immune-tolerant patients
      with chronic hepatitis B, and observe seroconversion rates, DNA decrease, the proportion of
      drug resistance, and relapse rate after treatment, as well as adverse effects.
