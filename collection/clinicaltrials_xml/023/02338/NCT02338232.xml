      This is single-center, open-label, prospective study of telmisartan for the prevention of
      acute GVHD in approximately 60 subjects undergoing allogeneic HCT for treatment of a
      hematologic malignancy. Subjects will receive 160 mg Micardis brand telmisartan once daily,
      starting 2 days prior to HCT (day -2). Once the patient is discharged post-HCT, treatment
      will continue through Day +98 post-HCT for a total of 101 days. After treatment
      discontinuation on or before day +98 post-HCT, subjects will be followed for up to 6 months
      for primary and secondary endpoints.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of:

               -  Acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia in remission,

               -  Myelodysplastic syndrome,

               -  Chronic lymphoid leukemia,

               -  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,

               -  Hodgkin lymphoma,

               -  Chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase,

               -  Myeloproliferative disorder, or

               -  Multiple myeloma

          -  Undergoing allogeneic HSC transplantation from a related or unrelated donor matched
             at least at 7 of 8 of the HLA-A, -B, -C, and DR loci (&quot;8/8&quot; or &quot;7/8&quot; match)

          -  Undergoing allogeneic HSC transplantation after a myeloablative TBI-, busulfan-, or
             (non-myeloablative) melphalan-based pre-transplant conditioning regimen. Regimens for
             transplantation will include at one of the following agents, given in conjunction
             with fludarabine or cyclophosphamide:

               -  Busulfan 130 mg/m2 iv daily x 2 (reduced intensity) or 4 days

               -  TBI 150 cGy bid x8 doses (1200 Gy)

               -  Melphalan 140 mg/m2. (Although melphalan is not a myeloablative regimen, it
                  results in clinically significant mucositis and patients receiving this
                  medication will be of considerable interest in the analysis of these data.)

          -  Male or female patient age 18 years or older

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70% at time of initiation of pre-transplant
             conditioning

          -  Transplantation-specific co-morbidity score of &lt;3 at time of initiation of
             pre-transplant conditioning

          -  Patients taking antihypertensive medications (including telmisartan) are eligible but
             the patient must discontinue treatment at least 48 hours prior to first dose of study
             medication

          -  Capable of giving informed consent and having signed the informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  Subjects with known heart failure, advanced renal impairment requiring renal
             replacement therapy, or liver failure although these patients would most likely not
             be eligible for HCT.

          -  Subjects taking ACE inhibitors, potassium supplements, or spironolactone (or any
             other potassium-sparing diuretics) who cannot discontinue use prior to initiation of
             study treatment OR who require a high-potassium diet

          -  Patient unable to discontinue current hypertension medication for medical or other
             reasons for two days prior to starting telmisartan

          -  Chronic symptomatic hypotension, volume depletion.
