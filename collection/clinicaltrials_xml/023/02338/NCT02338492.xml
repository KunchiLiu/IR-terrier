  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect safety and performance data of the Photodynamic Bone
      Stabilization System (PBSS) when used for the treatment of painful impending and actual
      fractures of the humerus secondary to metastatic cancer.

             bone disease.

          3. Females: neither pregnant nor intending to become pregnant during the course of the
             study, defined as:

               1. Postmenopausal for at least 1 year OR

                  have a negative pregnancy test at screening

          4. Patient, or his/her legally authorized representative, is able to understand and
             provide informed consent.

          5. Willing and able to comply with post-operative treatment protocol and follow-up visit
             schedule.

          6. VAS Pain Score &gt; 60mm on 100mm scale.

             -Impending Fracture-Specific Inclusion Criteria

          7. Documented presence of at least one metastatic lesion of the humerus.

          8. Mirels Criteria Score ≥ 8. (specific to the target humeral lesion and subject to
             minimum VAS score requirements)

          9. Destruction of cortical bone at impending fracture site &gt; 50%.

             -Actual Fracture-Specific Inclusion Criteria

         10. Fracture is closed, Gustilo Type I or II.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - General Exclusion Criteria

          1. Primary tumor (osteogenic origin, etc.) at site.

          2. Impending or actual fracture at any other location that, in the Investigator's
             opinion, would preclude ability to assess pain and/or function in the target humerus.

          3. Active or incompletely treated infections that could involve the device implant site.

          4. Distant foci of infection that may spread to the implant site.

          5. Allergy to implant materials or dental glue.

          6. In the investigator's judgment, functional deficit in the target humerus with an
             etiology other than bone metastases (e.g. due to vascular insufficiency).

          7. In the investigator's judgment, focal neurologic deficit as a result of metastases in
             the brain, spine, or other central nervous system disorders.

          8. Uncooperative patients, or patients who are incapable of following directions (for
             example, as a consequence of a neurological or psychiatric disorder).

          9. Prisoner

             -Impending Fracture-Specific Exclusion Criteria

         10. Mirels Score &lt; 8 (specific to target humeral lesion).

         11. Destruction of cortical bone at impending fracture site &lt; 50%.

         12. Prior surgery and/or prior fracture of affected site.

         13. Any articular component to impending fracture site.

             -Actual Fracture-Specific Exclusion Criteria

         14. Open fractures with severe contamination.

         15. Extremely comminuted fractures where insufficient holding power of the balloon on the
             intramedullary canal is probable.

         16. Patients whose intramedullary canal at site of fracture measures smaller than the
             diameter of the sheath provided.
