  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long down regulation protocol is widely used in the in vitro fertilization cycles, now
      it will be assessed regarding its efficacy, in poor responder females undergoing in vitro
      fertilization cycles, alone and after the addition of growth hormone.

    <description>Patients in this group were given a long protocol of pituitary down-regulation with triptorelin (Decapeptyl; Ferring, Switzerland) starting on the day 21 of preceding cycle at a dose of 0.1 mg/day, subcutaneously. On the second day of menstruation, Human menopausal gonadotrophin HMG (75 IU, Merional, IBSA) was started, and this was associated with reduction of triptorelin dose to 0.05 mg/day. This reduced daily dose, in addition to HMG, were continued till the day of hCG administration. Growth hormone (Norditropin, Novo nordisk) co-treatment was introduced on day 6 of HMG stimulation daily in a dose of 2.5 mg S.C. till the day of hCG administration.</description>
