  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the intestinal absorption of calcium from a
      novel calcium carbonate-vitamin D3 chewable tablet formulation (calcium 500 mg and vitamin
      D3 1000 IU) increases the amount of calcium excreted in urine and decreases parathyroid
      hormone (PTH) in serum as compared with Baseline.

      The drug being tested in this study is called Calcichew D3. Calcichew D3 is being tested to
      assess how it is processed by the body in healthy men and postmenopausal women. This study
      will look at lab results in people who take Calcichew D3.

      The study will enroll approximately 27 patients. All participants will receive the same
      treatment:

      â€¢ Calcichew D3 (calcium 500 mg and vitamin D3 1000 IU) chewable tablets All participants
      will be asked to take one tablet each morning of the treatment period.

      This single-centre trial will be conducted in France. The overall time to participate in
      this study is up to 44 days. Participants will make 2 visits to the clinic, including one
      7-day period of confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after
      last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
