  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy
      of RAD1901 in patients with advanced ER+, HER2-negative breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of RAD1901 in patients with advanced ER+HER2-negative breast cancer.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of RAD1901

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RAD1901

        -  To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor effect of RAD1901

    <description>Part A, Dose Escalation: Patients will be assigned sequentially to escalating doses of RAD1901.
Part B, Safety Expansion: Once the MTD has been identified and/or a RP2D has been selected, additional patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the RP2D.
Part C, Tablet Introduction: A cohort of patients will be enrolled the evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of a tablet dosage form.
Part D, Dose Exploration: Additional dose exploration of higher doses of the tablet dosage form based on initial PK findings or alternative dosing schedules may be conducted.</description>
