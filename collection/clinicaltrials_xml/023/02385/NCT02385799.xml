  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a control trial of sertraline (Zoloft) in children aged 2 to 5 years old
      inclusive with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The trial is six months long, and each participant
      will receive a series of tests at both the beginning and end of the study. The researchers
      hope to show improvements in language and social deficits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study and the UC Davis MIND Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorder
      (ASD) patients aged between 2 years and 5 years old inclusive funded by the Health Resources
      and Services Administration (HRSA). It is a double-blind control trial of sertraline
      (Zoloft), an anti-depressant typically used in the treatment of depression,
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and other conditions. The researchers are
      investigating the use of this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in ASD because a
      retrospective study has shown significant improvements in language and social deficits.
      There is also emerging evidence regarding the stimulation of brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF) and the stimulation of neurogenesis when an SSRI is given early on in the
      development of animal models of Down syndrome. The researchers hope to see improvements in
      language stimulation, social gaze and social reciprocity, spatial attention, and a decrease
      in autistic behaviors.

      The aim of this study is to carry out a double-blind placebo controlled trial of sertraline
      in children with ASD who are between the ages of 2 years and 5 years old inclusive. At
      baseline, the researchers will assess behavioral and cognitive development. Each participant
      will be involved in this trial for a period of six months. This will include three visits to
      the UC Davis MIND Institute and eight phone calls. The researchers will also assess the side
      effects of the sertraline treatment throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline and six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Preschool Language scale assesses auditory comprehension and expressive communication for children birth to 7 years 11 months. The measure examines the child's attention, play, gestures, social communication, semantics, language structure, integrative language skills and emergent literacy skills. The assessment has expanded coverage of early play behaviors, concepts, Theory of Mind, as well as emergent literacy skills. The assessment also has a means by which to track progress using Growth Scores to monitor a child's skills.</description>
