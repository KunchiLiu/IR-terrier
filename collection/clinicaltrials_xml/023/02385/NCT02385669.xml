    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a peptide vaccine with ipilimumab.
      This study will also evaluate the effects of the combination of the peptide vaccine and
      ipilimumab on the immune system. The investigators will monitor these effects by performing
      tests in the laboratory on participants' blood, a lymph node, and tumor samples.

    <description>The vaccine drug product, 6MHP, consists of 6 class II MHC-restricted peptides derived from melanoma proteins. Each vaccine consists of 200 mcg of each of the six peptides. An aqueous solution of vaccine is mixed 1/1 with Montanide ISA-51 to form water-in-oil emulsions. Vaccines are administered days 1, 8, 15, 43, 64, and 85. All peptide vaccines are administered intradermally and subcutaneously.
Ipilimumab will be administered in accord with the official prescribing information: 3 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks, for 4 doses. Ipilimumab will be administered on days 1, 22, 43, and 64.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with measurable stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma that have clinical or
             radiological evidence of disease. These participants may have had cutaneous, uveal,
             mucosal primary melanoma, or an unknown primary melanoma. The diagnosis of stage
             IIIB-IV melanoma must be confirmed by cytological or histological examination.
             Staging of cutaneous melanoma will be based on the revised AJCC staging system.
             Participants must be eligible to be treated with ipilimumab based on clinician
             judgment within standard of care.

          -  Participants will be required to have radiological studies to define radiologically
             evident disease. Required studies include:

               -  Chest CT scan,

               -  Abdominal and pelvic CT scan, and

               -  Head CT scan or MRI PET/CT fusion scan may replace scans of the chest, abdomen,
                  and pelvis.

          -  Participants who have metastatic melanoma available for biopsy pre-treatment and on
             day 22 must consent to having those biopsies. Metastases may be in nodes, skin, soft
             tissue, liver, or other sites that can be accessed by core needle biopsy, or
             incisional or excisional biopsy, with or without image guidance. The lesion(s) must
             be large enough to enable biopsy of at least 0.1 cm3 of tumor tissue (ideally 0.3 cm3
             or more) in 5 core biopsies (ideally 14-16 gauge, but 18 gauge is acceptable) or
             incisional/excisional biopsies at both time points. Biopsies may be taken from a
             single lesion or multiple lesions at each of the time points depending on the size of
             each lesion. Different lesions may sampled at each time point. It is acceptable to
             perform a biopsy pretreatment, and then to perform an excision at day 22, even under
             general anesthesia if needed. The lesions to be biopsied must be specified at study
             enrollment and not included as target lesions for RECIST calculations. There must be
             measurable disease in addition to the lesion(s) to be biopsied. Up to 15 participants
             whose metastases are not available for biopsy may be enrolled in the first stage of
             enrollment, and up to 17 participants whose metastases are not available for biopsy
             may be enrolled in the second stage of enrollment.

                  radiosurgery.

               -  There has been no evident growth of any brain metastasis since the most recent
                  treatment.

               -  No brain metastasis is &gt; 2 cm in diameter at the time of registration.
