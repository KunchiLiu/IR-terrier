  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase II trial of CD3/CD19 depleted, IL-15 activated, donor natural killer (NK) cells in
      adults and subcutaneous IL-15 given after a preparative regimen for the treatment of
      relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The primary objective is to study
      the potential efficacy of NK cells and IL-15 to achieve complete remission while maintaining
      safety.

    <description>Preparative Regimen:
Fludarabine 25 mg/m2 x 5 days start day -6 Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg x 2 days on day -5 and -4 (if &lt; 4 months from prior transplant, omit day -4 dose)
IL-15 Activated Donor NK Cells:
The apheresis product (collected day -1) will be enriched for NK cells with the large-scale CliniMacs® device (Miltenyi) by depletion of CD3+ cells to remove T-lymphocytes and depletion of CD19+ cells to remove B-lymphocytes. The NK cell enriched product will be activated by overnight incubation with10 ng/ml IL-15 under GMP conditions and infused on day 0.
IL-15 to Facilitate NK Cell Survival and Expansion:
IL-15 at 2 mcg/kg subcutaneously (SC) beginning day +1, once a day for 5 days followed by a 2 day rest, and then once a day for 5 days for 10 doses total</description>
