      The primary purpose of the RIO 2 study is to demonstrate that when the Reveal LINQ™
      insertable cardiac monitoring (ICM) system that records subcutaneous ECG insertion procedure
      performed in the in-office setting is as safe as LINQ™ insertions performed in the
      traditional hospital setting (operating room, cardiac catheterization or electrophysiology
      (EP) laboratory).

    <textblock>
      RIO 2 is a two arm, randomized, prospective, un-blinded, multicenter, non-significant risk
      study. The primary objective for RIO 2 will be assessed by randomizing subjects to receive
      their LINQ™ insertion in the office setting or in the traditional hospital environment.
      Moving the LINQ™ insertion procedure to the office setting is not expected to decrease the
      complication rate compared to in hospital insertion procedures, however, moving the LINQ™
      insertion procedure out of the traditional hospital setting may benefit the patient and
      reduce the burden to the healthcare system.

             follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has unusual thoracic anatomy or scarring at the implant site which may
             adversely affect the success of the implant procedure

          2. Patient has reduced immune function or is otherwise at high risk for infection per
             physician discretion

          3. Current therapy with immunosuppressive agents or chronic steroid use e.g. Prednisone

          5. Patient with active malignancy or history of chemotherapy or radiation treatment
             Patient has had a recent (within 30 days) or an active infection including but not

          6. Patient has had major surgery (in the past 6 months)

          7. Patient has undergone a procedure which required central venous or intraarterial
             access (e.g. AF/VT ablation, EP study, coronary angio) within the last 3 months or is
             scheduled for such a procedure while enrolled in the study.

          8. Prior history of surgical infection, prosthetic device infection, or endovascular
             infection, including endocarditis, in the past 12 months.

         10. Patient requires conscious or moderate sedation to receive LINQ™

         11. Patient is already implanted with a loop recorder

         12. Patient is implanted or indicated for implant with a pacemaker, ICD, CRT device

         13. Patient is enrolled in another study that could confound the results of this study,
