      100 patients aged 21-40 years old, diagnosed as primary or secondary infertility These
      patients are then assigned to receive ICSI treatment (ovulation induction, . They undergo a
      3D vaginal ultrasound before treatment to measure the junctional zone thickness and followed
      up after treatment to determine the rate of implantation.

      Intervention(s) All patients will undergo 3D ultrasound to measure the thickness of the
      junctional zone at day 21 of the cycle.

      100 patients aged 21-40 years old, diagnosed as primary or secondary infertility due to the
      following causes of infertility; ( Pelvic Inflammatory disease, dysovulation , tubal
      infertility, unexplained infertility, combined infertility or due to male factor ). These
      patients are then assigned to receive fertility treatment (ICSI) They undergo a 3D vaginal
      ultrasound before treatment to measure the junctional zone thickness and followed up after
      treatment to determine the rate of implantation.

      Intervention(s) All patients will undergo 3D ultrasound to measure the thickness of the

        women with primary or secondary infertility and were scheduled for a first IVF/ICSI

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A normal transvaginal ultrasound is defined as having no visible intracavitary
             pathology (e.g. submucous myomas, polyps or septa) and was be performed in the
             follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Intramural myomas without impression or
             deformation of the uterine cavity were incorporated in the definition of a normal
             ultrasound

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria included Females aged above 40 years old , patients with
             endometriosis, abnormal endocrine functions as Diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders
             and adrenal abnormalities ,general diseases, those with ovarian cysts or have
