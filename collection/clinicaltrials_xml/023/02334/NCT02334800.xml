  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of a single oral 75mg dose
      of palbociclib administered to healthy volunteers, and subjects with mild, moderate, and
      severely impaired hepatic function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-cohort single period study. The four cohorts will consist of healthy volunteers,
      and subjects with mild, moderate, and severely impaired hepatic function. Each cohort will
      receive the same treatment consisting of a single oral 75mg dose of palbociclib administered
      with food. Serial PK samples will be drawn up to 120 hours post dose for the cohort
      consisting of healthy volunteers, and will continue until up to 192 hours post-dose for the
      cohorts of hepatic impairment subjects.
