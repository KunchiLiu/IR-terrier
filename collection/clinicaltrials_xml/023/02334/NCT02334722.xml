    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if there are any differences between patients who
      receive Levetiracetam extended-release tablets for one week after surgery to remove a brain
      tumor versus those who receive Levetiracetam extended-release tablets for six weeks after
      surgery. Specifically, we will see if one group has less side effects than the other, and
      whether or not one group has more seizures than the other.

    <textblock>
      Because seizures are one of the leading neurologic complications in brain tumor patients,
      neurosurgeons prescribe antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to help prevent them. Although the
      American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines recommend that AEDs be stopped after the
      first post-operative week in patients without seizures, there is no standard length of
      treatment and some patients may stay on AEDs indefinitely.

      In an attempt to develop clinical guidelines for AED use in post-operative brain tumor
      patients, we will try to determine if taking levetiracetam extended-release (Keppra XR) for
      1 week results in less neurotoxicity than taking it for 6 weeks.
