      This multicenter phase II trial will evaluate palbociclib (PD-0332991) in patients with
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)
      (also referred to as p16) loss and positive Retinoblastoma (Rb) expression after failure of
      first-line chemotherapy.

      This multicenter phase II trial will evaluate palbociclib (PD-0332991) in patients with
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)
      (also referred to as p16) loss and positive Retinoblastoma (Rb) expression after failure of
      first-line chemotherapy. The study will enroll up to 40 patients to identify 36 evaluable
      patients, using a Simon's two-stage design, with a primary endpoint of progression free
      survival (PFS) at 4 months (PFS4). Secondary objectives include estimating median PFS,
      overall survival (OS), response rate (RR) and exploratory objectives include an evaluation
      of molecular predictors of response and resistance.

             performed within a CLIA-certified laboratory at UNC; if stage I of original cohort
             indicates futility, molecular requirement for eligibility will change to Rb+/CCND1

             perioperative i.e. neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings, patient is eligible provided the
