  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After any surgery, there is a risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including Deep Vein
      Thrombosis (DVT) in the major veins of the legs and Pulmonary Embolus (PE) in the lungs.
      These clots are usually prevented by the administration of low-molecular-weight heparin, a
      blood thinner that prevents clotting. In most surgical specialties like thoracic or vascular
      surgery, this treatment is used until patients are discharged from the hospital. However, in
      orthopaedic surgery, there is strong evidence that longer term preventative treatment up to
      35 days after hospital discharge helps to reduce VTE occurrences. In thoracic surgery, there
      is an even greater risk of developing PE because of the surgical stress, the common presence
      of cancer and direct damage to blood vessels in the lung during surgery. Despite the
      potential utility, the use of extended VTE prevention has never been evaluated in the
      thoracic surgery population. If extended treatment prevents clots, more patients will avoid
      complications related to VTE. There is currently very limited information available on the
      incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and
      the utility of extended thromboprophylaxis (ET) in this patient population. Furthermore, in
      contrast to patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery where ET has become standard of care,
      duration of thromboprophylaxis is not well defined in this patient population. Therefore,
      there is a clear need to systematically evaluate the effects of extended VTE prophylaxis on
      the incidence of VTE in the post-op population.

      There is currently very limited information available on the incidence of venous
      thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing lung cancer resection and the utility of
      extended thromboprophylaxis (ET) in this patient population. Furthermore, in contrast to
      patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery where ET has become standard of care, duration of
      thromboprophylaxis is not well defined in this patient population. Therefore, there is a
      clear need to systematically evaluate the effects of extended VTE prophylaxis on the
      incidence of VTE in the post-op population.

      As a pilot study, the primary outcome will involve feasibility measures. The investigators
      aim to measure the proportion of recruitment within each centre, compliance, loss to
      follow-up, and tolerability of the intervention, defined as the number and severity of
      per-defined adverse events. The primary outcome of interest for the future full-scale trial
      is the 30-day incidence rate of VTE following extended 30-day prophylaxis (defined as
      pulmonary emboli or deep venous thromboembolism of the lower limb as detected by CT
      (Computed Tomography) pulmonary angiography and full leg Doppler ultrasound, respectively)
      following lung resection for malignancies.

      The proposed pilot project is a multicenter blinded placebo-controlled randomized controlled
      pilot clinical trial assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of extended-duration VTE
      prophylaxis (30 days post-operatively) vs. short-term prophylaxis restricted to in-hospital
      stay with outpatient injected placebo, in patients undergoing lung resection for lung cancer
      or metastatic disease. All patients will receive both a peri-operative dose followed by
      postoperative VTE prophylaxis for the duration of their hospital stay. Those who were
      randomized to prolonged prophylaxis will continue the same dosage regime for an overall of
      30 days, whereas the control group will receive placebo injections for the same duration of
      time.

    <description>As a pilot study, there is an insufficient number of patients to definitively calculate incidence and compare treatment arms.

Major bleeding is defined as: Fatal bleeding OR Critical bleeding in a symptomatic area (intracranial, intraspinal, retroperitoneal, pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome) OR Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2g/dL or more as measured by a blood test at 30 days follow up, OR Bleeding requiring a blood transfusion of at least 2 units of packed red blood cells (excluding transfusions administered intra-operatively or 6-hrs post-operatively since these could not be impacted by post-surgical prophylaxis).
