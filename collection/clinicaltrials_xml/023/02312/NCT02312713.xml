  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of standard physical therapy and
      an internet-based exercise program for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Both of these
      programs will be compared to a &quot;waiting list&quot; control group. The investigators hypothesize
      that both treatments will result in greater improvement than the control condition and that
      the treatments will be similarly effective. The investigators also expect that some patients
      may do better with one treatment type or another and will explore this.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 12 in Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We are measuring change over time in the primary outcome measure for this study, the WOMAC is a measure of lower extremity pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and function (17 items).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 12 in the Satisfaction with Physical Function Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a validated 5-item questionnaire that assesses patients' satisfaction with their ability to complete basic functional tasks that are often affected by lower extremity OA, including stair-climbing, walking, doing housework (light and heavy, and lifting and carrying 68. All items are rated on a 7 point scale ranging from Very Dissatisfied (-3) Very Satisfied (+3).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 12 in a grouping of tests to assess Objective Physical Function</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will objectively assess physical function using seven tests. This group of tests is relevant to the proposed study because they assess aspects of daily function that require lower extremity strength, and that are often impacted by knee or hip OA. This battery examines balance (4 tests including a side by side stand, semi-tandem stand, tandem stand, and a unilateral stand), time to rise from a chair and return to the seated position for 30 seconds, timed up and go-rising from a seated position, walking a short distance and returning to seated position, and a 2 minute step test. For each test, the possible range of scores is 0-4, for a total range of 0-20.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 12 in the Patient Health Questionnaire-8</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms and severity will be assessed using the PHQ-8, a reliable and valid measure of depression71. The PHQ-8 is an eight-item survey derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) diagnostic tool, and consists of items corresponding to the depression criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Each of the eight questions is scored as 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), so that total scores range from 0 to 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 12 in The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS is a patient-reported outcome measurement instrument, developed to assess the patient's opinion about their knee and associated problems. The KOOS evaluates both short-term and long-term consequences of knee injury and also consequences of primary osteoarthritis (OA) }. It holds 42 items in five separately scored subscales: KOOS Pain, KOOS Symptoms, Function in daily living (KOOS ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (KOOS Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (KOOS QOL). Some of these items overlap with those with the WOMAC, and in those instances questions will only be asked once.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 12 in The PROMIS Sleep-related Impairment Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS adult sleep related impairment item bank focuses on self-reported perceptions of alertness, sleepiness, and tiredness during usual waking hours, and the perceived functional impairments during wakefulness associated with sleep problems or impaired alertness. It assesses sleep-related impairment over the past seven days. This scale includes 8 items, each measured on a 5-point Likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 12 in The PROMIS Fatigue Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Fatigue instruments evaluate a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one's ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles. Fatigue is divided into the experience of fatigue (frequency, duration, and intensity) and the impact of fatigue on physical, mental, and social activities. It assesses fatigue over the past seven days, This scale includes 8 items, each measured on a 5-point Likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 12 in the The Brief Fear of Movement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Fear of Movement Scale is a six item scale for assessing fear of movement in OA. The scale specifically assesses activity avoidance due to pain-related fear of movement. All items are measured on a 4-point scale from &quot;strongly agree&quot; to &quot;strongly disagree.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 12 in the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) is a self-report, 12-item scale that measures level occupational, household, and leisure activity during a one-week period. 73 This scale was particularly developed for use among older adults; although all participants in the proposed study will not be age 65 or over, patients with knee OA typically have more limited physical activity than the general population. Therefore we believe this scale will be more applicable to our participant group than scales that were developed for younger adults.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to month 4 and month 4 to month 12 in Additional Self-Report Physical Activity Items</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to the assessment of overall physical activity that will be provided by the PASE, we are particularly interested in purposeful exercise behaviors that correspond to the IBET intervention and those typically prescribed in the context of standard PT for knee OA. We will ask participants, at each assessment point, to report the number of times and minutes per week, on average, they are completing strengthening, stretching, and aerobic exercises</description>
