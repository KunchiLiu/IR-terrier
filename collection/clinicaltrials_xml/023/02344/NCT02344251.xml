  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pharmacotherapy trials involving drug-dependent individuals, medication compliance is a
      significant issue, as rates tend to be low and adherence to medication may predict improved
      outcomes (Baros et al, 2007; McRae et al, 2004; O'Brien et al, 1996; Somoza et al., 2010).
      However, methods commonly used to determine compliance may result in inaccurate measurement
      of adherence. In this study, we propose to assess the effectiveness and safety of the
      ID-Cap-M, a novel compliance measurement device, in a healthy population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the acceptability, tolerability,
      and efficacy of the ID-Cap-M in a healthy population. The ID-Cap is an ingestible medical
      device for detecting the presence of an ingested capsule inside the gastrointestinal (GI)
      tract.

      Participation in the study takes 3 visits over a period of approximately six weeks. The
      first visit is a screening visit to determine if participants are eligible to participate.
      After the initial assessment visit, participants will be randomized to one of two groups.
      Group 1 will have compliance measured by self-report and urine riboflavin levels. This group
      will not receive computer-chipped capsules, but will receive their medication in a bottle
      capped with a MEMS Track Cap, which records when the medication bottle is opened and closed.
      Group 2 will receive computer-chipped capsules and will have compliance measured by
      self-report, urine riboflavin levels, and data collected by an e-Tect reader. Participants
      randomized to this group will also receive reminder calls and/or text messages to ingest the
      study medication if a signal is not sent from the e-Tect reader to the study team within one
      hour of the scheduled medication administration time. They will also be using biometric
      identification technology to ensure that they are taking the capsules as directed,
      specifically electrocardiogram (ECG).

      After the initial screening visit, participants will be required to attend two clinic visits
      during the six-week study, a randomization visit and a one-week follow-up visit
      approximately one week after last medication dose.
