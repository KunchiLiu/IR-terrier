    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to pilot-test a culturally-salient physical activity intervention,
      using a randomized design, among under served, overweight/obese South Asian women at high
      risk for developing Diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity prevents type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Although physical
      inactivity and DM are common in the United States (US), the investigators data, and
      others,have shown that Asian Indian and Pakistani (South Asian) women are at even greater
      risk. South Asians (SA) are one of the fastest growing segments of the US population.Studies
      show that SA women have a markedly higher DM prevalence and are less physically active than
      women from other racial/ethnic groups.SA also have greater insulin resistance and visceral
      adiposity at a lower body mass index (BMI). A combination of regular, moderate intensity
      physical activity (PA) and resistance exercises has been shown to decrease visceral
      adiposity and improve insulin sensitivity, even without weight loss; thus, PA may be
      especially important for DM prevention among SA women. Despite being at increased risk, very
      few evidence-based DM prevention and PA interventions exist for SA women in the US.

      This proposal builds on a successful academic-community partnership between Northwestern
      University and Metropolitan Asian Family Services, an organization that provides health care
      and social services to lower-income SA immigrant families. The partnership has focused on
      translating and implementing evidence-based lifestyle interventions for SA immigrants in
      real-world, clinic and community settings. The investigators formative research found that
      SA women, in particular, were not being reached by current efforts to promote PA.
      Importantly, however, the main reasons for the reduced effectiveness of traditional
      strategies for PA promotion related more to socio-cultural perceptions and beliefs than
      simply to language barriers. SA women reported little PA and had difficulty even defining
      exercise. Although 75% of women were sedentary and overweight, they did not recognize these
      as risk factors for DM. Lack of knowledge about benefits of PA, cultural and linguistic
      isolation, concerns about modesty, and rigid gender roles strongly influenced SA women's
      proclivity for physical inactivity. In this context, much more work will be needed to
      address SA women's physical inactivity than simple language translation of proven lifestyle
      interventions.
