      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of the Cefaly device in the
      treatment of chronic migraine prior to implement a control trial where the size and final
      protocol will be specified thanks to the outcomes of this pilot trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of chronic migraine meeting the diagnostic criteria listed in
             ICHD-III beta (2013) section 1, migraine (1), with the exception of ''complicated
             migraine'' (i.e., hemiplegic migraine, migraine with brainstem aura, ophthalmoplegic
             migraine-recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy, migrainous infarction) will be
             enrolled. They are required during baseline to have ≥15 headache days with each day
             consisting of ≥4 hours of continuous headache and with ≥50% of days being migraine or
             probable migraine days; and ≥4 distinct headache episodes, each lasting ≥4 hours.

        Both patients with or without acute medication overuse (medication overuse headache - MOH)
        will be recruited

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women: Pregnant, lactating or &lt;6 months post partum

          2. For patients already on treatment with medications in the following classes:
             antihypertensives, antidepressants, antiepileptics, no dose change of those
             medications is allowed for at least 3 months before start of baseline and during the
             entire study period.

          3. For patients treated with Botox, no injection within 4 months before start of
             baseline or during the study.

          4. Diagnosis of other primary or secondary headache disorders, except of Medication
             Overuse Headache

          5. A Beck Depression Inventory score of &gt;24 at baseline

          6. Psychiatric disorders that could have interfered with study participation

          7. Intolerance to supraorbital neurostimulation that makes the treatment not applicable
             (test of nociceptive threshold with specific Cefaly program)
