      RATIONALE: Studying samples of DNA in the laboratory from patients who received
      fludarabine-based treatment may help doctors learn more about the effects of fludarabine on
      cells. It may also help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying DNA samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia previously treated with fludarabine-based therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify genetic characteristics associated with the efficacy and toxicity of
           fludarabine-based treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who
           participated on E2997.

        -  To validate these genetic characteristics with a cancer cell model system to confirm
           association and dissect the mechanism of effect.

      OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for genetic characteristics associated with the
      efficacy and toxicity to fludarabine-based treatment using Affymetrix 6.0 single nucleotide
      polymorphism arrays. The results are then compared with data of genes identified in a cancer
      cell model system, and with clinical data (response, toxicity, overall survival, and
      progression-free survival) associated with each patient sample.
