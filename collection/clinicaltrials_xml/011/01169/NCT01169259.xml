      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized clinical trial in 25,874
      U.S. men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin D3
      (2000 IU) or omega-3 fatty acids (OmacorÂ® fish oil, 1 gram) reduces the risk of developing
      cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of these
      illnesses.

    <textblock>
      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized clinical trial of vitamin D
      (in the form of vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol]) and marine omega-3 fatty acid
      (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements in the primary
      prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Existing data from laboratory studies,
      epidemiologic research, small primary prevention trials, and/or large secondary prevention
      trials strongly suggest that these nutritional agents may reduce risk for cancer or
      cardiovascular disease, but large primary prevention trials with adequate dosing in general
      populations are lacking.

      Eligible participants were assigned by chance (like a coin toss) to one of four groups: (1)
      daily vitamin D3 and omega-3; (2) daily vitamin D3 and omega-3 placebo; (3) daily vitamin D
      placebo and omega-3; or (4) daily vitamin D placebo and omega-3 placebo. Participants had an
      equal chance of being assigned to any of these four groups and a 3 out of 4 chance of
      getting at least one active agent.

      Participants in all groups take two pills each day -- one softgel that contains either
      vitamin D3 or vitamin D placebo and one capsule that contains either omega-3 or omega-3
      placebo. Participants receive their study pills in convenient calendar packages via U.S.
      mail.

      Participants also fill out a short (15-20 minute) questionnaire each year. The questionnaire
      asks about health; lifestyle habits such as physical exercise, diet, and smoking; use of
      medications and dietary supplements; family history of illness, and new medical diagnoses.
      Occasionally, participants may receive a phone call from study staff to collect information
      or to clarify responses on the questionnaire.

      At baseline, 16,956 VITAL participants provided an optional blood sample. Approximately
      6,000 of these participants will provide a follow-up blood sample during years 1-4 of the
      trial.

      At baseline and year 2 of the trial, a subcohort of 1,054 VITAL participants living within
      driving distance of Boston, Massachusetts received detailed in-clinic health assessments at
      the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) of Brigham and Women's Hospital. During
      CTSC visits, participants have a clinical exam, including measurement of height, weight,
      other anthropometrics, blood pressure, and physical performance. They also provide fasting
      blood and urine samples, and undergo 2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing, lung function
      testing (spirometry), electrocardiograms, bone mineral density testing, 2D-echocardiography,
      and assessments of thinking and mood.
