      This research is being done to find out why Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) (i.e., Crohn's
      disease and ulcerative colitis) occurs in individuals and in families. Recently the
      investigators and other researchers have found a gene (DNA) that when changed, gives people
      a higher risk for developing IBD or other inflammatory diseases like IBD. By doing this
      research, scientists and doctors will study the cells in the blood to see how the
      gene-change affects the way the blood cells' immune system works.

    <textblock>
      The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)—Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have
      an estimated combined prevalence of 0.2% to 0.3% in the United States, and are two to eight
      times more prevalent in Jewish Americans of Central or Eastern European descent (Ashkenazi
      Jews) as compared to non-Jewish Americans. CD may involve any part of the gastrointestinal
      tract, but most often the colon and terminal ileum. Bowel inflammation is discontinuous,
      transmural, and may contain granulomas. CD is also associated with bowel stenoses and
      intestinal and perianal fistulas. UC, by contrast, involves continuous, non-granulomatous
      inflammation of the colon and rectum, limited to the mucosal layers. Fistulas are not
      observed. Colonic disease that cannot be clearly identified as CD or UC is designated
      &quot;indeterminate colitis&quot;.

      There is strong evidence from twin studies and familial aggregation that CD and UC are in
      large part genetic, and follow a complex, non-Mendelian mode of inheritance. First-degree
      relatives of IBD patients have an 8 to 10 fold increased risk of developing IBD. Therefore,
      it was hypothesized that IBD is in part the result of mutations and disease polymorphisms in
      specific susceptibility genes. Furthermore, the complications, site of disease, onset and
      severity show increased familial concordance. Therefore, these and perhaps other factors in
      variability of disease expression and course appear to be in part under genetic control. The
      hypothesis is that familial disease aggregation is the result of IBD susceptibility genes
      disease risk polymorphisms and mutations. Loci containing these disease genes can be
      identified by linkage mapping and the disease gene polymorphisms can be determined by
      showing linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the disease variant greater in affected IBD cases
      as compared to within family (parental) or unrelated, matched controls. Power analyses show
      that to have 80% power to only identify IBD susceptibility loci with a relative sibling risk
      of 1.5 and an error of p = 0.01 and heterogeneity of 0.3 would require a genome screen on
      approximately 200 affected relative pair pedigrees. It would require several times this
      number of pedigrees to have power to establish these loci at genome wide levels of
      significance (Brant and Shugart, Inflamm Bowel Dis, 2004). To have power to establish (at p
      = 10-7) disease specific risk polymorphisms by LD association analyses—for genotypic
      relative risks of 2.0 with complex models of inheritance would require 350 to 700 cases and
      350 to 700 controls or a similar number of parental/affected offspring &quot;trio&quot; pedigrees
      (i.e. up to 1400 parents with 700 affected offspring) (Knapp, AJHG, 1999). To establish
      lower relative risk polymorphisms would require about three times these numbers.

      The current protocol was initiated in 1996 to initially collect multiplex pedigrees for
      linkage studies. The investigators performed the first IBD genome screen in North America in
      1998 with DNAs from pedigrees collected from the study combined with those from the Univ. of
      Chicago and identified multiple loci, and confirmed the IBD1 locus on chromosome 16. In
      2003, the investigators published a second genome wide screens that also included a large
      series

      of patients recruited at Johns Hopkins under this protocol identifying and comfirming
      additional loci. The investigators (and others) have identified 8 confirmed IBD loci
      (IBD1-8), and there are several additional loci with strong evidence in one or more screens
      (Brant and Shugart, Inflamm Bowel Dis., 2004). The investigators have recently received
      funding for a new genome screen performed at the NIH funded Center for Inherited Disease
      Research (CIDR) genotyping facility, and samples are being submitted at this time. From
      these multiple loci, three proven disease genes for IBD have been established; the most
      provocative is the NOD2/CARD15 gene for the IBD1 locus. This gene is an intracellular sensor
      of bacterial cell wall components and a critical player in the innate immune system known to
      be important in IBD pathogenesis (Hugot et al and Ogura et al; Nature, 2001). The
      investigators participated in this discovery (Ogura et al., Nature, 2001).

      There are three independent mutations in the NOD2 gene (G908R, R702W, and Cins1007fs) that
      are consistently increased in white CD patients as compared to healthy controls. These
      mutations interfere with the gene's ability to sense muramyl dipeptide, the critical
      bacterial cell wall residue. The investigators added to the protocol in 2001 permission to
      study isolated cells and biomarkers from larger blood withdrawals from study subjects and
      the investigators have found evidence for NOD2 gene expression variants. The two other
      established genetic factors are haplotype associations in the HLA region (IBD3) and the
      chromosome 5q cytokine cluster (IBD5, leading candidate are functional mutations in the
      OCTN1/2 genes). The investigators have also identified NFKB1 and MDR1 IBD predisposing
      polymorphisms.

      Despite the exciting discoveries of multiple genes associated with IBD, altogether, these
      genes account of only a fraction of familial risk. Therefore, the investigators will
      continue to enroll participants to meet the present goal for recruitment of 2,500 samples
      composed of IBD pedigrees for linkage and familial LD studies, and singleton cases and
      controls for case-control LD association studies. The investigators will also work to
      discover if there is association of the genes with biomarkers from serum (the investigators
      have examined anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody and NOD2), and cells from blood and
      immortalized blood from IBD patients as compared to controls. In addition, the investigators
      will test biomarkers to evaluate their potential as predictors of disease course and
      therapeutic outcome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        ADULTS:

          -  Patients with IBD and their family members who have or do not have IBD.

          -  People that do not have IBD nor have a family member with IBD needed for comparison
             purposes.

          -  The age inclusion criterion for the Multiple Blood Draw (MBD) is 18 years of age or
             older.

        CHILDREN:

          -  Children greater than age 4 with IBD and their family members who have or do not have
             IBD.

          -  People that do not have IBD nor have a family member with IBD needed for comparison
             purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The only exclusions are age parameters and health reasons that would preclude their
             enrollment; such as, for anemic patients. Blood-draws on anemic patients may, in
             certain medical cases, pose a health risk to them; therefore, we request that if they
             are anemic that they present a letter from their personal physician giving explicit
             permission for them to join if at the time it is clinically advisable.
