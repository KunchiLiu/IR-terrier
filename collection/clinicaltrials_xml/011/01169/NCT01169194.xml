  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing the research to discover genes that cause Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease (IBD) specifically in the African American population. Who May Join This Study?
      Blacks / African Americans with or without Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

      If you agree to join the study, the investigators ask that you give us information about
      your health. The investigators will also ask you to give us a blood sample so that they may
      discover the genes that cause IBD. The blood sample may be collected at Johns Hopkins or any
      local facility convenient to you.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This current protocol was established as part of an NIDDK consortium initiative to further
      explore genetic factors associated with IBD. Specifically, the investigators are interested
      in identifying the genetic, environment and socio-economical components that contribute to
      the development of IBD in the African American population.

      Positional identification of IBD genes has only been performed in ancestral European
      American (EA) populations. Recent reports have found that IBD incidence may be similar in
      both AA and EA (Kurata et al. 1992). Because of different ancestry, AA IBD risk alleles may
      be unique. For example, the investigators did not find any of the common NOD2 mutations in
      an initial genotyping of a small set of the AA CD patients. A search of the scientific
      literature demonstrates that of the greater than 1000 published studies concerning IBD gene
      mapping, gene association or simply genetic epidemiology, none contained reference to IBD in
      &quot;blacks or African Americans.&quot; Therefore, the genetics of IBD in African Americans is
      unknown. The goal of the study is to understand the genetics of IBD in African Americans.
      The investigators will specifically characterize the IBD1, IBD3, and IBD5 genetic loci in
      these populations. In addition, the investigators will investigate the possible role of
      variations in the OCTN cation transporter genes which were recently found to be associated
      with Crohn's disease in a European population.

      IBD is believed to be caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Genotype
      data will be examined alongside potential environmental factors such as smoking,
      medications, environmental exposures, and some dietary factors. Since IBD is known to
      predominantly affect Western, industrialized areas of the world, the investigators will also
      inquire about participants' socioeconomic background in hopes of identifying any previously
      unknown factors in the AA population that may increase the risk of IBD in this population.
      These potential environmental factors will be important in association analyses using
      covariates as these factors can obscure potential associations or interact with genetic
      factors and thus contribute to genetic associations. The investigators will also obtain
      information as to ancestry of parents and grandparents as to best match cases with unrelated
      controls of similar ancestry (e.g., Caribbean, recent European or recent African ancestry
      could cause genetic mismatch of a case and control). At the same time, the investigators
      will also collect similar information (smoking, medications, environmental exposures and
      dietary factors) from non-African Americans for the purpose of making direct comparisons for
      these parameters between the different racial groups to assess the contribution of
      non-genetic factors for susceptibility to the development of IBD.

      The protocol calls for recruiting AA patients and ethnically matched controls (friend or
      spouse) and relatives with or without IBD. These persons will provide us with a blood sample
      and with information requested on a questionnaire asking the following: clinical course and
      history of their IBD or their general health, smoking history, socioeconomic variables and
      specific dietary factors known in some populations to be related to IBD etiology. Access to
      medical records will be used to confirm diagnoses. The clinical characteristics of IBD
      obtained from medical records will be summarized in a phenotyping form using a standardized
      NIDDK IBDGC Phenotyping Operations Manual. Controls will be asked health history to identify
      potentially unrecognized IBD. Parents and siblings can be used as within-family controls
      (particularly for family based linkage disequilibrium testing), more distant relatives can
      be useful for determining haplotypes and, when a family history of IBD is present, for
      potential linkage analysis testing for chromosomal regions shared in affected relative
      pairs. Such analyses are very robust to unrecognized population stratification; no such
      studies have been performed in the AA population. DNA will be purified from blood and used
      to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with AA IBD, as compared to within-family and
      unrelated controls. Samples and data will also be shared with the NIDDK IBD GC for use in
      IBDGC research projects. They will be processed and stored by the Rutgers University/Cell
      Repository and the NIDDK IBDGC Data Coordinating Center at University of Chicago. In
      addition, serum samples purified from blood will be processed and stored at Fisher
      Bioservices for Consortium projects.

      Recruitment will also target non-African American patients for comparison purposes. These
      patients will be administered the same questionnaire. At the time of enrollment, no blood
      draw is required but permission is requested from the participant to be contacted at a
      future date should a blood draw be needed. Participants are not obligated to provide a blood
      sample at a later time and will only do so after signing a new consent giving us explicit
      permission.

      A secondary goal of this study is to determine whether there are racial differences in the
      IBD health outcomes and health utilization. The investigators will be comparing African
      Americans subjects to the white comparison group detailed above. In addition to the clinical
      questionnaire above, a phone interviewer will contact a subset of the IBD patients (adults
      ages 18 and older) to ask if they are willing to participate in a phone survey and to obtain
      verbal consent. This health services supplemental questionnaire will inquire about insurance
      access, physician utilization, health-related quality of life, indices of disease severity,
      income, occupational history, patient-reported adherence, and patient trust-in-physicians.
