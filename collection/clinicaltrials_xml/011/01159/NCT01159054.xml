  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with kidney failure on hemodialysis have an extremely high rate of cardiovascular
      disease including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This, at least in part, is due to
      the chronic inflammatory status usually seen in these patients. Here we try to see if
      treatment with extended release nicotinic acid (Niaspan) can reduce their overall
      inflammatory burden (in general) and the atherosclerotic plaque inflammation (in
      particular).
