    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies how well gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway
      inhibitor RO4929097 works in treating patients with advanced, metastatic, or recurrent
      triple negative invasive breast cancer. Gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor
      RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumour activity of RO4929097 in recurrent and/or metastatic triple
      negative breast cancer through co-primary endpoints of overall response rate (ORR) using
      RECIST and 6-month progression-free survival rate (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumour activity of RO4929097 through secondary endpoints including:
      duration of radiologic response, progression-free and overall survival rates within the
      protocol defined follow-up period.

      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of single agent RO4929097 in breast cancer.

      III. To explore expression of Notch biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer and
      potential interaction with RO4929097 response and toxicity.

      IV. To evaluate the downstream effects of RO4929097 in advanced triple negative breast
      cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO)
      once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             ventricular arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,
             uncontrolled psychotic disorders, serious infections, active peptic ulcer disease,
             psychiatric illness, or any other medical conditions that might be aggravated by
             treatment or limit compliance

          -  No active malignancy at any other site

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule;
             those conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the
             trial

          -  Patients must be able to swallow pills

          -  The effects of RO4929097 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because Notch signal pathway inhibitors are
             known to be teratogenic, if women of childbearing potential do not abstain from
             sexual activity (documentation that they have been abstinent from sexual activity at
             least 4 weeks prior to study entry) they must use two forms of contraception (i.e.,
             barrier contraception and one other method of contraception) at least 4 weeks prior
             to study entry; women of childbearing potential be can either be abstinent or use two
             forms of contraception for the duration of study participation, and be either
             abstinent or use two forms of contraception for at least 12 months post-treatment;
             men must use condoms when sexually active with women for the duration of study
             participation and at least 12 months post-treatment

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study; at least 2 weeks must have
             elapsed since any surgery or radiotherapy

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases are excluded; patients with
             controlled brain metastases (no radiographic progression following radiation and/or
             surgical treatment and no neurological signs or symptoms) will be allowed but must
             NOT be currently taking corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone) to control neurologic
             symptoms of brain metastases; patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of brain
             metastasis are not eligible unless brain metastases are ruled out by CT or MRI

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to RO4929097 or other agents used in the study

          -  Patients taking medications with narrow therapeutic indices that are metabolized by
             cytochrome P450 (CYP450), including warfarin sodium (Coumadin) are ineligible

          -  Preclinical studies indicate that RO4929097 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inducer of
             CYP3A4 enzyme activity; caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097
             concurrently with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and/or inhibitors; furthermore,
             patients who are taking concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or
             substrates of CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any
             potential risk; if such patients cannot be switched to alternative medications, they
             will be ineligible to participate in this study

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with
             intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets

          -  Patients with suspicion of active Hepatitis A, B or C infection and a resulting
             positive serological result, or have a history of liver disease, or other forms of
             hepatitis / cirrhosis are ineligible

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia,
             hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for
             the institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this
             study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia other than chronic, stable atrial fibrillation, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RO4929097 is a Notch pathway
             inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with RO4929097, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with RO4929097; these potential risks may also
             apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Patients known to be HIV-positive who are on combination antiretroviral therapy are
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RO4929097;
             in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
             with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients with baseline (within 7days prior to starting study treatment) QTc &gt; 450
             msec (male) or QTc &gt; 470 msec (female);

               -  History of risk factors for QT interval prolongation, including, but not limited
                  to family or personal history of long QT syndrome, recurrent syncope without
                  known etiology or sudden unexpected death

               -  History of torsade de pointes or other significant cardiac arrhythmias or the
                  need for concomitant meds with known potential to prolong QT interval or
                  antiarrhythmics

          -  Patients who have not recovered to &lt; CTCAE grade 2 toxicities related to prior
             therapy are not eligible to participate in this study
