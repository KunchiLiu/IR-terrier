  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether a 6-month multilevel physical activity
      intervention can significantly increase physical activity levels in sedentary adults, 65 and
      older, living in Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs).

      Sedentary residents (N=320)in 16 CCRCs will receive the multilevel MIPARC intervention or a
      control health education program for 6 months. A group randomized control design will be
      employed with site as the unit of randomization. The intervention is delivered through group
      sessions, phone calls, printed materials, tailored signage and mapping and targeted peer led
      advocacy efforts.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective monitoring of physical activity suggests that fewer than 3% of adults over age 60
      meet current physical activity guidelines. Ecological models posit that behavioral
      interventions are most effective when they operate on multiple levels. The MIPARC study
      intervenes on four levels: individual (pedometer-based self monitoring, educational
      materials and monthly counseling calls), interpersonal (monthly group sessions and peer
      mentoring), environment (walking signage prompts, tailored walking maps, step counts)and
      policies (review of on-site activity opportunities and walkability, recommendations for
      change and peer led advocacy)to increase the activity levels of residents. The study
      promotes walking as the primary means to increase light to moderate PA, with a secondary
      focus on strength and flexibility and decreased sedentary behavior.

      As most Continuing Care Retirement Communities have management structures that provide the
      opportunity to improve the social and built environments for physical activity and walking,
      this study also aims to train participants on how to advocate for improvements in the
      environment that would improve walkability.

    <description>Sixteen Continuing Care Retirement Communities will be randomized to either the MIPARC intervention or an attention-control condition. The intervention will focus on increasing light to moderate PA, primarily promoting walking by gradually increasing participants' daily step counts.
The MIPARC study intervenes on four levels: individual (pedometer-based self monitoring, educational materials and monthly counseling calls), interpersonal (monthly group sessions and peer mentoring), environment (walking signage prompts, tailored walking maps, step counts)and policies (review of on-site activity opportunities and walkability, recommendations for change and peer led advocacy)to increase the activity levels of residents.
For the first 3 months, intervention participants will engage in either a group educational session, phone counseling call, or a peer led session, on a rotating basis. The telephone counseling calls will be eliminated after 3 months.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive an active health education intervention. The education curriculum will involve both lectures and mailed materials. The lectures will be delivered to match the MIPARC intervention schedule. Sessions will include information on general health and healthy aging. Physical activity will not be discussed in these sessions but participants will receive information on the benefits of PA. Control participants will also receive a health check phone call to match the individual attention paid to participants in the MIPARC intervention sites.</description>

    <intervention_name>Physical Activity</intervention_name>
    <description>MIPARC will focus on 3 physical activity goals:
increasing walking behavior through gradually increasing step goals
increasing attendance at available on-site and local aerobic, strength and flexibility classes, as well as prompting stair use,
reducing sedentary behavior. Participants will monitor their steps with a pedometer, daily step logs and progress charts. All participants will have a gradually increasing fixed step goal for each week that will result in an total increase of 3000 steps after 3 months, which they will be supported to maintain for an additional 3 months.</description>

    <intervention_name>Group educational sessions</intervention_name>
    <description>Every three weeks, participants will be required to attend a group education session, where researchers will teach behavior change strategies and allow participants to share their experiences and offer support to each other. The group sessions will follow a common format including: a group exercise (e.g. quiz), group discussion of use of behavior change strategies (e.g. overcoming barriers), and will end with a behavior change strategy instruction and goal setting component.</description>

    <intervention_name>Phone counseling call</intervention_name>
    <description>To support a tailored intervention delivery, participants will receive 4 individual phone calls (in weeks 2, 5, 8, and 11) from a trained health counselor. The phone call will follow the following format:
health check
step goal check
barrier identification
problem solving
specific goals to achieve target step counts. Counselors will prompt participants to report any adverse events, illnesses, medication changes or counter indicative symptoms. The calls will cease during the second 3 months to allow participants to practice self help techniques while still supported by the group sessions and peer mentoring.</description>

    <intervention_name>Peer Mentoring</intervention_name>
    <description>Three peer mentors at each CCRC will be trained in intervention content and delivery, measurement support, and advocacy. The peer mentors will lead a group session once every three weeks for the 6 month intervention period and once a month for the following 6 months. The peer mentors will formulate their own ideas for these sessions but we will suggest they include group walks, group activities and trips to active locations, etc.
The peers will help study staff to answer questions from participants and assist with study compliance and retention. They will also receive advocacy training from a non-profit advocacy organization to conduct walk audits of their CCRC and help mobilize participants to make changes to their community that will increase or improve the opportunities for physical activity.</description>

    <intervention_name>Policy Change</intervention_name>
    <description>In order to increase the sustainability of the project, MIPARC will focus on addressing on-site policies and neighborhood factors that are barriers to physical activity. Peers and staff will conduct site inspections to identify these barriers (e.g. lack of facilities, limited opening hours, unsafe sidewalks, etc.) which will be prioritized and presented to CCRC management and community officials.</description>

    <description>A binder of professionally prepared materials will be provided at the beginning of the intervention and are referred to by researchers in the group sessions and phone counseling calls. The materials provide important information to encourage knowledge, self efficacy and realistic expectations.</description>
