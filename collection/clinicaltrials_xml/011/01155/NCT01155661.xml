      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      LY2216684 administered once daily (QD) in the adjunctive treatment with a selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for up to approximately 1 year in patients with major
      depressive disorder (MDD) who are partial responders to their SSRI treatment.
