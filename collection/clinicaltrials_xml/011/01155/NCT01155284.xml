  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sanford Research/USD proposes to study the combination therapy of oral administration of
      sitagliptin and lansoprazole versus placebo for the preservation of pancreatic beta cells
      still present in patients with recent-onset diabetes and possibly regenerating their beta
      cells, while safely down-regulating the autoimmune response directed against the beta cells.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, based on American Diabetes Association criteria,
             recently diagnosed (within the 6 months before Screening) and confirmed by the
             presence of at least 1 diabetes related autoantibody (either glutamic acid
             decarboxylase [GAD], insulinoma-associated protein [IA 2], or insulin, the latter
             measured within 10 days after starting insulin therapy).

          -  Male or female aged between 11 and 45 years, inclusive.

          -  Able to swallow study capsules.

          -  Willing to comply with &quot;intensive diabetes management&quot; as directed by the
             investigator, with the goal of maintaining blood glucose as close to American
             Diabetes Association recommendations as possible.

          -  Willing to comply with the schedule of study visits and protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of a GLP 1R agonist or DPP 4 inhibitor within 1 month before enrollment.

          -  Use of a PPI within 1 month before enrollment.

          -  Use of an oral hypoglycemic agent within 1 month before enrollment or use of
             thiazolidinediones within 3 months before enrollment (although thiazolidinediones may
             be used &lt;7days before enrollment).

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable
             method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period.

          -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of enrollment.

          -  Subjects with any of the following conditions:

               -  Renal insufficiency, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less
                  than 50 mL/min at Screening, calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal
                  Disease (MDRD) equation.

               -  History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to sitagliptin or lansoprazole,
                  such as anaphylaxis or angioedema.

               -  Severe hepatic insufficiency.

               -  History of pancreatitis or gallbladder disease

               -  Any significant medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator or
                  medical monitor would interfere with study participation.
