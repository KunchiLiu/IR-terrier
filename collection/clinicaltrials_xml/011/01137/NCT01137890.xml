    <textblock>
      This is a residential pilot trial to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between
      zonisamide and cocaine, with the goal of evaluating zonisamide's potential for the treatment
      of cocaine dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a residential pilot trial to evaluate the effect of zonisamide (ZNS) on cocaine
      reinforcement, craving and relapse. Cocaine addiction remains a major social and medical
      problem that imposes a significant burden on our society, as more than a half million
      cocaine dependent individuals are seeking treatment every year. Medications that act to
      antagonize the glutamate system and/or increase the GABA-system are new targets in the
      search towards effective cocaine treatment. ZNS is part of a new line of antiepileptic
      agents that act both as glutamate antagonists and to enhance the GABA system. Topiramate, a
      similar agent, showed a positive signal in a pilot trial for cocaine dependence. ZNS has the
      advantages of a longer half-life requiring only once a day dosing and, being better
      tolerated, it requires a shorter induction phase and can be administered at higher doses. We
      hypothesize that ZNS in moderate to high doses will attenuate the central effect of cocaine
      and improve the neural perturbations resulting from cocaine use, thus decreasing cocaine
      craving. Healthy, adult cocaine dependent volunteers will be enrolled on our residential
      unit for 44 days for this double-blind within subject study. The pharmacodynamic
      interactions between ZNS and cocaine will be measured in cocaine self-administration
      procedure offering alternative reinforcers with monetary values. Cocaine reinforcing effect
      will be evaluated over a range of doses, and subjective and objective outcomes on mood and
      behavior will be collected. In addition, the effect of ZNS on ad-lib smoking will be studied
      on the days when no other procedure interferes with smoking behaviors. Neurocognitive and
      psychomotor effects of ZNS treatment will also be studied with an extensive test battery on
      the day of the week when no cocaine is administered. This study will explore the potential
      therapeutic effect of ZNS for the treatment of cocaine dependence while providing necessary
      safety assessments required for possible future outpatient clinical trials.
