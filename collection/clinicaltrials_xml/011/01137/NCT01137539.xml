  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility and success of performing the TVT-Secur in
      the office setting. Endpoints would be success, complications, and patient and physician
      acceptance of the procedure. Success would be assessed by validated questionnaires.

      This is a prospective single arm study of 20 patients who will have the TVT-Secur procedure
      done in the office under local anesthesia. They will be followed for a period of 1 year.

      The study will include 20 patients who would meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and who
      sign the informed consent. Subjects are diagnosed with Stress urinary incontinence resulting
      from urethral hypermobility with no prior urinary incontinence surgery. Subjects are women
      who no longer intend to bear children and who do not require any other concomitant surgery.
