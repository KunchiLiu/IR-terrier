  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-masked study to compare intravitreally administered 0.5 mg ranibizumab to
      2.0 mg ranibizumab in subjects who manifest persistent or recurrent macular fluid less than
      30 days following treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Patients will be masked to
      their treatment assignment.

      The study duration is anticipated to be 12 months and will enroll 30 subjects . Patients
      will be randomized 2:1 to either 2.0 mg ranibizumab or 0.5mg ranibizumab.
