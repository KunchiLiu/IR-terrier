    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the memory immune response and the yearly persistence
      of the immunity against Japanese Encephalitis (JE) after vaccination with a new Japanese
      Encephalitis Chimeric Virus (JE-CV) in participants previously vaccinated with JE-CV.

      Objectives:

        -  To describe JE immune status before, and after a JE-CV booster dose in subjects
           previously vaccinated with JE-CV

        -  To describe the immune status before, and immune response following JE-CV vaccination
           in JE-naïve control subjects.

        -  To describe the safety (in terms of solicited and unsolicited adverse events) of a
           single dose of JE-CV up to 6 months after the last vaccination.

        -  To describe all related serious adverse events (SAEs) and related deaths from 6 months
           to 5 years after vaccination in JE-CV-primed subjects.

      Study participants who are previously immunized with Japanese Encephalitis Chimeric Virus
      (JE-CV) vaccine will receive a single dose of the new JE-CV and will be followed up for 5
      years for immunogenicity.

      The control (JE-CV naive) participants will receive either one dose of JE-CV or one dose of
      varicella vaccine.

      All participants will be monitored for safety for 6 month post vaccination.
