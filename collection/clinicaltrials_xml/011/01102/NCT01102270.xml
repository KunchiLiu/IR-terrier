    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether taking eszopiclone (Lunesta) changes the
      breathing effort required to briefly wake people with obstructive sleep apnea from sleep
      (respiratory arousal threshold). We would like to see if taking eszopiclone can reduce the
      severity of obstructive sleep apnea in some people (those that have a low respiratory
      arousal threshold; i.e. wake up easily to respiratory stimuli).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is an exceedingly common disease with major neurocognitive and
      cardiovascular consequences. The current primary treatment e.g. Continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) is effective but poorly tolerated by many patients particularly those with
      mild-moderate disease. Secondary treatments such as oral appliances to advance the mandible
      or surgical procedures to enlarge the airway are commonly appealing to the patient. However,
      these approaches have only modest success in reducing apnea frequency to an acceptable
      level. Thus, finding tolerable and effective therapy for sleep apnea remains an important
      objective.

      The causes of sleep apnea vary between patients. Targeted therapy according to the
      underlying causes of sleep apnea in individual patients is likely to be most effective.
      However, current therapeutic options for sleep apnea are quite limited. The purpose of this
      physiological research study is to determine if taking eszopiclone (Lunesta)changes the
      breathing effort required to briefly wake people with obstructive sleep apnea from sleep
      (the arousal threshold) and if administration of the sedative medication eszopiclone
      (Lunesta) to certain sleep apnea patients (those with a low arousal threshold ie wake up
      easily) would be beneficial.
