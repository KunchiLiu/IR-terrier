  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this &quot;randomised Phase II trial&quot; all patients will receive carboplatin, with half
      randomly selected to receive ZD4054. The other half to also receive a dummy pill or placebo,
      this is so that we can accurately assess how much extra benefit ZD4054 may give. The trial
      will recruit 132 patients with metastatic breast cancer from across the UK and assess
      whether adding ZD4054 to carboplatin delays progression of their disease. It will also show
      whether the side effects of adding ZD4054 to carboplatin chemotherapy are acceptable.

      Because ZD4054 has not previously been given with carboplatin to this population, in Stage 1
      of the study 6 patients will receive ZD4054 with carboplatin. If there are no untoward side
      effects with carboplatin and ZD4054 then the trial will proceed to Stage 2 and a further 126
      patients will be randomised to receive carboplatin with either ZD4054 or the placebo;
      neither the patient nor their doctor will know whether she is receiving ZD4054 or placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the UK about 41,000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. More and more
      patients are surviving breast cancer, mostly due to the earlier detection and improvements
      in treatment. Nevertheless, in about 6% of patients the cancer has already spread to other
      parts of the body when they are first diagnosed; in a further 30% of patients the cancer
      comes back elsewhere in their body after initial treatment. Once it has spread to other
      parts of the body, breast cancer is incurable, with patients living, on average, a further
      24 months. The aims when treating patients with metastatic breast cancer are to prolong and
      improve their day to day life. A number of different chemotherapy drugs are available for
      treatment of metastatic breast cancer. There is, however, still a need to develop new
      treatments. The aim of this trial is to use a new drug called ZD4054 combined with an
      established chemotherapy drug (carboplatin) to see whether this prolongs the period for
      which patients live with the cancer kept under control.

      ZD4054 is a new, oral drug which may help to slow down cancer growth. It works by blocking
      growth that is controlled by specific proteins on cancer cells called endothelins.

      Endothelins act by binding to their endothelin receptors, presence of these receptors have
      been found in about 45% of breast cancer cases. ZD4054 is an endothelin receptor blocker. We
      hope to show that adding this new drug increases the effectiveness of carboplatin. We know
      from trials in other cancers that similar drugs may be able to slow down the growth of
      tumours.

      Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains incurable and there has been little change in long
      term outcomes. Chemotherapy is used to improve symptoms and prolong survival in patients
      with advanced breast cancer. Nevertheless, most tumours inevitably progress and the clinical
      response rates to subsequent chemotherapy agents are disappointing. There is, therefore, a
      need for continued clinical research into new strategies to enhance the effectiveness of
      currently available chemotherapy agents to improve survival.

      The endothelin pathway has been implicated in a number of oncogenic pathways. ET-1 and ETAR
      are frequently over-expressed in breast cancers and are prognostic for poor outcome.
      Inhibition of the endothelin pathway enhances cytotoxicity when combined with chemotherapy
      agents such as carboplatin in pre-clinical models. ZD4054 is a specific inhibitor of ETAR
      and represents a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.

      This study investigates whether ZD4054, an oral endothelin A receptor (ETAR) inhibitor, in
      combination with carboplatin chemotherapy, has sufficient activity to warrant a future Phase
      III trial in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer.
