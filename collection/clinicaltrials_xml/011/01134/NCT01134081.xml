      The purpose of this research study is to understand more about wound healing of gum tissue.
      Fluids collected from between a tooth and the gum and directly from wounds contain proteins
      that occur in different levels as the wound healing process proceeds. In this research study
      wound fluid will be collected from the donor palate site (roof of your mouth) and the
      treated sites on your gum before and after placement of CelTx or conventional treatment
      (tissue from the roof of your mouth) to measure which proteins and how much of each are
      present during the first 4 weeks of wound healing.

      In a clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of rhPDGF-BB to
      promote soft and hard tissue engineering of the periodontium, the subjects provided gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) or periodontal wound fluid (WF) and the results demonstrated
      contrasting inducible expression patterns of PDGF-AB, VEGF, and ICTP during periodontal
      healing [17, 24, 25]. However, little is known regarding the release of these molecules into
      local periodontal wound fluid during tissue-engineered grafts.

      The aim of this study is to determine the presence and influence of angiogenic biomarkers,
      such as PDGF, EGF, HGF, VEGF, KGF, and FGF, involved in the wound healing process of tissue
      engineered grafts in the treatment of subjects (with recession-type defects) who have an
      insufficient zone of attached gingival associated with at least two nonadjacent teeth.

      3. STUDY OBJECTIVES The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the expression of
      angiogenic biomarkers involved in the wound healing process of 2 different periodontal
      surgical approaches: 1) CelTx™ (living bilayered cell therapy product) and 2) free gingival
      grafts.

      3.1 Hypothesis •

      Ho: WF levels of angiogenic biomarkers (PDGF-BB, VEGF, FGF, HGF, KGF, EGF, ICAM-1, ANP-1,
      ANP-2, ANG, IG-10, TIMP-1, TIMP-2) are lower in:

      - Areas treated by CelTx™ than treated by free gingival grafts.

      •

      Ha: WF levels of angiogenic biomarkers (PDGF-BB, VEGF, FGF, HGF, KGF, EGF, ICAM-1, ANP-1,
      ANP-2, ANG, IG-10, TIMP-1, TIMP-2) are equal in:

      - Areas treated by CelTx™ and free gingival grafts.

    <description>CelTx™ is a living bilayered cell therapy product. CelTx™ is constructed of Type I bovine collagen (extracted from bovine tendons and subsequently purified) and viable allogeneic human fibroblasts and keratinocytes isolated from human neonatal foreskin. This is applied once in the oral cavity.</description>
