    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition that involves intense memories of a
      traumatic event and intense, persistent feelings of anxiety. There are several effective
      therapies for PTSD, but they are often time consuming. The investigators want to see if the
      investigators can shorten treatment time while keeping therapy effective by adding a
      medication called methylene blue, USP, taken orally as a pill, to the therapy. The specific
      aims are: 1) To see whether medication plus psychotherapy improves PTSD symptoms more than
      placebo plus psychotherapy or a waitlist; 2) To examine the long-term outcome of those
      receiving medication plus psychotherapy 1 and 3 months after treatment has ended; 3) To
      examine whether medication plus psychotherapy helps with depression, trauma-related
      cognitions, and functioning.

      The psychotherapy the investigators are offering in this study is a type of cognitive
      behavioral therapy called imaginal exposure. In imaginal exposure, the investigators
      encourage the client to approach the memory of the trauma by recounting the trauma story to
      the therapist and discussing his or her reactions to the memory.
