    <textblock>
      This is a study of tramadol as an agent for short-term opioid withdrawal treatment. A
      randomized, double blind clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tramadol to
      clonidine and buprenorphine in the short-term treatment of opioid withdrawal will be
      conducted. Opioid dependent participants will be treated on a residential unit. The primary
      outcome measure is opioid withdrawal symptoms.

    <description>Participants in this study will be assessed for opioid withdrawal on a daily basis. The primary outcome measure for this assessment is the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS), which is a well-established clinical assessment tool for quantifying the different signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The COWS has been validated, and scores can range from 0 to 47. It is administered by a clinician on the ward.</description>

        Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants in this study will be males and females between the ages of 18 and 60
             years.

          -  Applicants must be opioid dependent based upon the Structured Clinical Interview for
             DSM-IV (SCID); in addition, they must have an opioid positive urine during the
             screening process (or have evidence of opioid withdrawal).

          -  They must be healthy, with no significant medical illnesses (e.g., insulin dependent
             diabetes), and without significant psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia) besides
             their drug dependence.

          -  Females will have a pregnancy test prior to study enrollment, and if found to be
             pregnant will be excluded and referred to a substance abuse program for pregnant
             women (the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy) on the campus.

          -  Volunteers will also be excluded if they have pre-admission hypotension (due to the
             use of clonidine in the study).

          -  Applicants with a history of seizures (including substance-related seizures, such as
             alcohol withdrawal related) will be excluded.

          -  Alcohol and/or sedative dependence will be specific exclusionary criteria (given the
             small risk of seizures associated with tramadol use).

          -  Allergies to any of the study medications will be grounds for exclusion.
