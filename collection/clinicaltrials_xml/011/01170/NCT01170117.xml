  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a serious illness associated with substantial morbidity and
      mortality. Weight restoration is a treatment priority, and better treatments are needed.

    <textblock>
      This study is a 16-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of olanzapine in
      adult outpatients with AN. 160 individuals with AN, ages &gt; 18, will be randomly assigned to
      receive olanzapine or placebo for 16 weeks together with a medication management treatment.
      Primary outcomes will include weight gain as well as psychological symptoms known to be
      associated with AN, including obsessionality, mood, and anxiety.

      This project is based on evidence from a recently completed 8-week pilot study comparing the
      efficacy of olanzapine to placebo in outpatients with AN (PI: Evelyn Attia, MD), as well as
      a recently published 12-week trial of olanzapine vs placebo (Bissada et al, Am J Psychiatry,
      2007) in which outpatient treatment with olanzapine was associated with weight improvement,
      improved psychological status, and no untoward metabolic effects among low-weight patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that among underweight adult outpatients with AN receiving
      olanzapine vs. placebo, together with medication management treatment: 1)patients with AN
      receiving olanzapine will gain weight at a faster rate than those receiving placebo; and 2)
      patients with AN receiving olanzapine will demonstrate greater reduction in psychological
      symptoms, including obsessionality, mood, anxiety and eating disorder symptoms, than those
      receiving placebo.

             Inhibitor (SNRI), or use of benzodiazepine or non-benzodiazepine sleep agents. These
             permissible medications may be continued during the trial if they have been in use by
             the patient for a period of &gt; 4 weeks at an unchanged dose without any evidence of
             consistent weight gain (i.e., &gt; 3 lbs/months)

             long as there have been no changes in therapy intensity and the psychotherapy has not
             been associated with weight gain &gt; 3 lbs over the previous 4 weeks. Subjects may also
             participate if they recently received partial weight restoration treatment in an
             intensive inpatient or day program as long as they can document that they have not
             consistently gained weight in their current treatment setting for the 4 weeks prior
             to baseline screening.)
