  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health concern, and the search for useful pharmacologic
      interventions is ongoing. This study aims to develop a comprehensive series of assessments
      to directly assess eating behavior, cognitive functioning, and psychological functioning
      under sibutramine and placebo conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit 48 moderately obese men and women seeking weight-loss treatment to
      participate in a 3-week, randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial of sibutramine 15mg or
      placebo daily. At the end of weeks 1 and 3, subjects will be asked to participate in a
      two-day/three-night stay in the Residential Laboratory or BSU of NYSPI for comprehensive
      assessments. The major outcome variable will be the difference in total daily caloric intake
      between sibutramine and placebo.

      Assessments will concentrate on three main components of eating behavior: eating patterns,
      psychological processing, and neurocognitive function. Eating behavior studies will examine
      objective variables such as meal size, meal frequency, and subjective aspects of eating such
      as hunger and fullness. Psychological studies will measure hedonics, including craving,
      behavioral restraint, and impulsivity. Neurocognitive function assessment will gather
      information about decision-making, such as the effects of distractors (food and non-food) on
      task performance. Additionally, drawing from the field of behavioral neuroeconomics, tasks
      that assess decision-making and the influence of irrational factors on decisions will be
      assessed. Neuroimaging (fMRI) procedures will also be conducted, and will augment the
      psychological and neurocognitive assessments by providing a window into the underlying
      neural circuitry involved.

      Following the double-blind phase, participants will be offered open treatment with
      sibutramine for weight loss.
