  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether MRI is more accurate than CT in
      determining the T stage, N stage, depth of tumour invasion and extra mural venous invasion
      (EMVI) preoperatively in colon cancer.

    <textblock>
      The patient will proceed with their usual colon cancer assessment and treatment, including
      colonoscopy with biopsy and histology and preoperative CT chest abdomen and pelvis. In
      addition, patients who enroll in the study will have 2 preoperative MRIs of their abdomen
      and pelvis performed. One of these will be performed on a 1.5T and the other will be
      performed on a 3.0T MRI scanner. We will use 20mg of IM buscopan to reduce bowel mobility
      for each scan. A coronal scout scan will be taken to identify the tumour and select the
      target volume. IV gadolinium (a contrast agent routinely used in MRI scans to help identify
      different tissues) will be administered, and a 3D VIBE scan (T1 weighted) will be performed
      of the target volume. The liver will also be imaged at this time to look for liver
      metastases. A T2 weighted 3D volume acquisition will then be obtained of the target volume
      containing the tumour (and its lymphatic drainage).

      The MRI will be independently reported by an expert without knowledge of the results of any
      other investigations. The results of the MRI scan will then be made available to the
      clinical team. The patient will then proceed as normal with any other investigation which
      the clinical team feel is necessary, and be treated as normal for their colon cancer. The
      patient will proceed with their surgery as normal, and the specimen removed at the time of
      the operation will be examined in the pathology laboratory to determine the exact stage of
      the cancer.

      The accuracy of CT and MRI in staging colon cancer will then be determined against the
      reference standard provided by the histology examination.
