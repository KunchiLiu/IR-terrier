    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if LY2216684 (fixed 6 mg or flexible 12 mg to 18 mg
      once daily) is superior to placebo once daily in the adjunctive treatment of participants
      with major depressive disorder (MDD) who were identified as partial responders to an
      adequate course of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), during an
      11-week, double-blind, acute adjunctive treatment phase.
