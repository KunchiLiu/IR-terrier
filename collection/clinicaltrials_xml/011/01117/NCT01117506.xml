  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To validate the use of Corus™ CAD blood assay in subjects who are referred for the work-up
      of coronary artery disease. The study will evaluate the clinical utility of a gene
      expression test (Corus CAD) in subjects referred for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)
      work-up for suspected obstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). The Corus
      CAD is a gene expression test that quantify the expression of multiple genes from
      circulating peripheral blood cells to detect the presence of clinically significant
      obstructive CAD in patients with chest pain.

    <time_frame>Up to 45 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for the COMPASS study is to assess whether the Corus CAD gene expression test performance is superior to an AUC of 0.5. The endpoint will be evaluated based on the current gold standard test for CAD, invasive coronary angiography, or a research CCTA after the subjects have undergone both the Corus CAD and MPI tests. Superiority will be assessed based upon demonstration of p&lt;0.05 testing of the Corus CAD AUC versus an AUC of 0.50.</description>

             possibly due to cardiac ischemia).

          -  Referred for a stress test using MPI.

             presume normal HbA1c if none documented.

          -  Total WBC ≥ 11,000 cells/ul and platelet count ≤ 75,000 cells/ul from a CBC with
             differential drawn within 7 days prior to enrollment [WBC ≥ 11,000 cells/ul and
             platelet count ≤ 75,000 cells/ul from a CBC drawn &gt; 7 days prior need to be re-drawn
             at enrollment].

          -  Recipient of any organ transplant.

          -  Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy including any dose of systemic
             corticosteroids in the preceding 2 months.

          -  Chemotherapy in the preceding year.

          -  Major surgery in the preceding 2 months.

          -  Blood or blood product transfusion in the preceding 2 months.

          -  Subjects for whom all forms (stress or pharmacologic) of MPI are contraindicated.

          -  Subjects for whom invasive coronary angiography or coronary CT angiography is
             contraindicated, including IV beta-blocker.

          -  Subjects who planned to decline research CCTA or invasive coronary angiography,
             regardless of MPI result.

          -  Subjects with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter or frequent irregular or rapid
             heart rhythms.

          -  Known history of renal insufficiency (serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL), or severe
             allergy to iodinated contrast.
