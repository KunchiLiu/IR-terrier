    <textblock>
      This trial is designed as a multi-centre, open label, dose-escalation, phase I trial and
      consists of five parts. Part A investigates the safety and PK of escalating weekly dosing of
      Sym004 in patients with recurrent advanced solid tumors. Part B and C validates the safety,
      PK and efficacy of weekly dosing of Sym004 at the MTD in a homogenous patient population
      with advanced mCRC and wild-type KRAS. If MTD equals 12 mg/kg, then part C will explore the
      9 mg/kg level. Part B will be initiated when a safe dose has been established in Part A.
      Part D and E is to validate the safety, PK and efficacy when administered every 2 weeks at
      doses of 12 mg/kg and 18 mg/kg, respectively. Part F is to validate safety, PK and efficacy
      when administered with a single loading dose 9 mg/kg followed by weekly doses of 6 mg/kg.
