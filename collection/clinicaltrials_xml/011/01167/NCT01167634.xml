  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-arm, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of financial
      incentives to motivate and sustain long-term weight loss. The study will recruit eligible
      employees at a large health management company to participate in a 6-month weight loss
      program and have weight measurements for an additional 3-month follow-up period. The primary
      outcome measure in this randomized controlled trial will be pounds of weight lost. The
      experimental groups will include variations of deposit contracts (participants put their own
      money at risk, and lose that money if they fail to achieve their weight loss goal) and fixed
      payments. The use of deposit contracts is a powerful mechanism for inducing behavior change
      that is based on loss aversion, a psychological concept first described by Nobel Prize
      winner Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. A deposit contract takes advantage of the
      fact that people typically feel the pain of a loss more than the pleasure of a gain,
      increasing ones motivation to reach a goal.

      The study hypotheses are 1) mean weight loss will be greater in all intervention groups
      compared to the control group by the end of 24 weeks; and 2) individuals in the intervention
      groups will have a lower mean weight at the end of the 3-month follow-up period than
      individuals in the control group.
