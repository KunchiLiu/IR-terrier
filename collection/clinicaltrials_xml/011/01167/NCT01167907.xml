  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A nerve block catheter is a small tube placed next to a nerve through a needle, and the
      needle is then removed. Numbing medicine is dripped through the tube to reduce pain
      sensation from the nerve.

      The purpose of this research study is to test whether the placement of a second nerve block
      catheter, rather than a single injection for the saphenous nerve block will improve pain
      relief and/or reduce pain medication needed after surgery enough to justify two nerve block
      catheters.

      There are two nerves that carry pain sensations from the ankle, the large (sciatic) nerve
      and the smaller (saphenous) nerve. Patients undergoing ankle fusion or fracture surgery at
      Wake Forest University typically have a nerve block catheter placed next to the sciatic
      nerve to give local anesthetic (numbing medicine) for 24-72 hours. In addition, a single
      injection of local anesthetic is usually performed to block the saphenous nerve for 12-16
      hours postoperatively.
