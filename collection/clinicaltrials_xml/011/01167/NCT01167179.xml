      The purpose of this study is to conduct an early evaluation of a nurse-led follow up
      intervention added to the usual medically oriented follow up care. Besides evaluating the
      feasibility and acceptability to patients, the effect on psychosocial adjustment and quality
      of life of patients is determined.

      Background: After treatment for cancer, follow-up surveillance is regarded important. In
      head and neck cancer patients however, increasing research evidence shows that at least the
      goal of detecting recurrence of cancer during routine control visits in an asymptomatic
      stage is not achieved. Other goals of follow-up such as management of treatment
      complications and helping patients and families cope and adjust remain important and ask for
      an accurate, effective but tailored and sensitive approach. Increasingly, nurses are
      mentioned as care providers best suited to perform this task.

      Aim: The purpose of this study is to conduct an early evaluation of a nurse-led follow up
      intervention added to the usual medically oriented follow up care. Besides evaluating the
      feasibility and acceptability to patients, the effect on psychosocial adjustment and quality
      of life of patients is determined.

      Methods and design: A quasi-experimental prospective design is used. Two groups of patients
      are enrolled consecutively (n=160) and patient data are collected at baseline (T0), at 6(T1)
      and at 12(T2) months respectively. The duration of the intervention is defined to the first
      year of follow up. Participating nurses are trained prior to the recruitment of the
      intervention group and receive supervision and individual coaching during the entire
      duration of the intervention phase.

      Outcome measures: Primary outcome, psychosocial adjustment to illness. Secondary outcomes,
      health related quality of life, psychosocial problems, and usage of care.

    <description>Usual care Participants in the comparison group receive the usual care which consists of a 5 year medical routine control schedule based on the national guidelines, and - if appropriate - involvement of the dietician and the speech language therapist.During years one to five the routine control appointments are planned at a minimum of every 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 months respectively. Most patients who undergo a total laryngectomy have additional contact with an oncology nurse during their 6-8 weekly medical control visits at the outpatient clinic for approximately the first year of follow-up. All other head and neck cancer patients have no structured follow-up contact with an oncology nurse.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Interventional care During the first year of follow-up every 2-monthly medical control visit is preceded or followed by a nursing consultation of 30 minutes for all included patients in the intervention group. No restrictions are made with regard to cancer stage, site or treatment modality. Thus, at least 6 nursing consultations are planned in this way but nurses are allowed to plan extra nursing consultations if necessary.
Content of the intervention Consists of structured and standardised nursing follow up consultations comprising a thorough needs assessment, supportive counseling, adequate referral to other care providers if necessary and improvement of the continuity of follow-up care. The goals of nursing follow-up care are summarised as helping patients (and often their partners too) to cope with the physical and psychosocial consequences of treatment and help them to gradually adjust to 'the life after', and into survivorship.</description>
