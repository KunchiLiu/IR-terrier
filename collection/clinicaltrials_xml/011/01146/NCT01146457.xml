      The purpose of this study is to determine the ideal dosage of intrathecal morphine for intra
      and post partum analgesia, while minimizing the side effect profile.

      Regional anesthesia techniques such as combined spinal epidural (CSE) analgesia are very
      effective for the management of intrapartum pain. The advantages of these techniques are
      that they are safe when properly conducted and that they provide excellent analgesia while
      allowing the patient to remain awake and participate in the labor and delivery. The risks of
      maternal aspiration and fetal drug depression associated with general anesthesia are
      minimized. Finally, the effective analgesia associated with regional techniques blunt the
      hemodynamic effects caused by painful contractions and reduce maternal catecholamines,
      resulting in increased placental perfusion.1

      Opioids in combination with local anesthetics in the spinal space provide effective pain
      relief during labor with minimal side effects. The advantages of spinal opioid
      administration include lack of motor blockade and faster onset of analgesia.2 In addition,
      since the opiate receptors are in the spinal space, a smaller amount of opioid can be used
      to provide excellent pain relief while minimizing the side effects. At Beth Israel Deaconess
      Medical Center (BIDMC), the obstetric anesthesiology group uses a standard spinal dosing for
      CSE during labor which includes: 1 ml of 0.25% bupivicaine with 12.5 mcg of fentanyl.

      Yeh and colleagues have found that morphine 150 mcg added to the fentanyl-bupivicaine spinal
      injection can prolong the duration of spinal analgesia but was associated with increased
      side effects. 3 The side effect profile of spinal narcotics include: nausea, vomiting,
      pruritus, and urinary retention. Although these side effects for the most part can be easily
      treated, they can be bothersome to the post partum patient. In a previous study performed
      from our institution, the addition of 100 mcg of morphine to spinal bupivicaine and fentanyl
      reduced the rate of breakthrough pain during labor analgesia and prolonged the time to first
      request for supplementation. Overall, it was found that the incidence of side effects was
      low but the group that received the spinal morphine did have more nausea and vomiting
      compared with the placebo group. 4

      In this current investigation, we would like to assess whether an even smaller dose of
      spinal morphine would provide an effective, pain free recovery from vaginal delivery while
      decreasing the incidence of side effects, specifically nausea and vomiting. We would like to
      perform a formal dose response study to identify the ideal dose of intrathecal morphine that
      would not compromise the pain relief during labor while minimizing the side effects.

    <description>Rate of breakthrough pain is the number of episodes of breakthrough pain divided by the time period of labor. Time measured from placement of the neuraxial anesthetic, until delivery of the neonate. Because duration of labor is different for all patients, the rate is used as the primary outcome.</description>
