  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to address unanswered questions about the
      relative effectiveness of treatments for children with both Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD) and significant reading difficulties (RD). The study evaluates attentional
      and word reading outcomes for students with both conditions when provided with either (a)
      ADHD treatment alone, (b) RD treatment alone, or (c) the combination of ADHD and RD
      treatment.

      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to address unanswered questions about the
      relative effectiveness of treatments for children with both Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD) and significant reading difficulties (RD). The study evaluates attentional
      and word reading outcomes for students with both conditions when provided with either (a)
      disorder-specific ADHD treatment (carefully managed medication + parent training), (b)
      disorder-specific RD treatment (intensive, individualized reading instruction), or (c) the
      combination of ADHD and RD treatment. The study aims to address the relative benefits of
      providing either disorder-specific ADHD or RD treatment alone and providing the combined
      treatment. The investigators hypothesize that the combined treatment approach will result in
      better outcomes in terms of both word reading/decoding and a reduction in ADHD symptoms than
      either of the disorder-specific treatments alone. Treatment will last for 16 weeks, with
      assessment prior to and following treatment and some measures collected regularly throughout
      the intervention periods.

    <description>Carefully-managed medication and behavioral parent training. Medication treatment begins with a four-week titration period, beginning with a trial of methylphenidate. If benefit is insufficient or side effects are intolerable, the physician may initiate a trial of mixed salt amphetamine, followed by either Atomoxetine or Guanfacine. When the optimum medication and dosage is determined the child returns for monthly medication maintenance visits until the end of the 16-week intervention period. Parent training consists of nine group sessions provided by a psychologist addressing ADHD and its treatment, principals of behavior modification, and evidence-supported practices for managing behavior.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Meet criteria for ADHD, Combined Type or ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type based
             on the DISC-IV parent interview, Teacher baseline SNAP endorses additional
             non-overlapping Inattentive symptoms with the parent DISC, which when combined with
             the parent ratings result in endorsement of 6 or more symptoms required for diagnosis
             by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.

          2. Have at least 4 symptoms of inattention rated &quot;Often&quot; or &quot;Very Often&quot; on the teacher
             version of the SNAP-IV.

          3. Have a standard score of 90 or lower on either the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of
             Achievement Letter-Word Identification or Word Attack Subtests, or on the Basic
             Reading Skills Cluster

          4. Attend a participating school in Grades 2-5

          5. Have at least one parent or guardian who understands English well enough to
             participate in the behavioral parent training intervention.

          6. Have a Full Scale OR Non-Verbal IQ estimate higher than 70 based on the IQ Composite
             and Non-Verbal IQ estimate of the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT-2).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any documented or suspected bipolar disorder, severe psychosis, or other severe
             emotional disturbance, developmental disability, or autism.

          2. Receipt of primary school reading instruction in a language other than English.

          3. A history or presence of cardiovascular problems that would contraindicate stimulant
             treatment.

          4. Chronic vocal tics.

          5. Children will be excluded if they are taking a concomitant medication that has the

             to take along with the study medication, or if they have not been on a stable dose of
             a psychotropic medication long enough to fully assess the clinical outcome or
             tolerability.
