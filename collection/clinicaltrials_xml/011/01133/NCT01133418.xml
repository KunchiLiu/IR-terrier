    <textblock>
      Currently, only two treatment modalities for pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) are considered evidence-based: (1) pharmacological and (2) behavioral
      treatment. Recently, several studies have shown promising results suggesting efficacy for
      cognitive training interventions for children with ADHD. These interventions directly train
      cognitive function (i.e., attention, working memory) by having children practice cognitive
      skills using computerized tasks. In these studies, improvements related to the cognitive
      training intervention have been documented on neuropsychological tests, academic tasks, and
      parent ratings of children's ADHD behavior. Given the ubiquitous finding of increased
      reaction time (RT) variability among children with ADHD, the candidate worked with a group
      of developers to modify a cognitive training intervention to target RT variability. That is,
      train the children to be less variable in their responding. Initial clinical data from this
      intervention suggest that intervention exposure improves behavioral outcomes. However, an
      appropriate powered randomized clinical trial is necessary to experimentally demonstrate
      intervention efficacy.Sixty-four (64) children diagnosed with ADHD (either Predominantly
      Inattentive Type or Combined Type) will be randomly assigned to intervention or control
      conditions. Children in the intervention group will receive 8 weeks of the Computerized
      Progressive Attention Training (CPAT) intervention. Children in the control group will
      receive the CPAT intervention but there will be no progression in difficulty based on
      performance as in the intervention group. Children in both groups will be assessed
      pre-intervention and immediately after the 8-week training on neuropsychological,
      behavioral, and academic outcome measures. Hypothesis-driven data analyses will assess
      intervention efficacy.

      Hypothesis #1: Children in the experimental group exposed to the CPAT intervention will show
      greater improvement from pre- to post-intervention on neuropsychological tests compared to
      children in the control group.

      Hypothesis #2: Children in the experimental group exposed to the CPAT intervention will show
      greater improvement from pre- to post-intervention on parent and teacher behavioral ratings
      of ADHD behavior compared to children in the control group.

      Hypothesis #3: Children in the experimental group exposed to the CPAT intervention will show
      greater improvement from pre- to post-intervention on academic outcomes compared to children
      in the control group.

    <description>Children in the control condition will participate in the same tasks as children in the Intervention arm. They will experience the same number of blocks and trials of training as the intervention group. Further, their training will be conducted by the same set of trainers and for the same amount of time as the intervention group. However, children in the control group will remain at the lowest level for each CT task throughout training irrespective of performance.</description>

    <description>Four comprehensive training tasks were developed and programmed based on expansions and modifications of various tasks that have been extensively investigated in the attention literature and are known to reflect primary attentional functions. Each task is discussed in detail in the Research Methods (section D.6.b). Briefly, they included a Continuous Performance Task, a Conjunctive Search Task, an Orienting and Flanker Task, and a Global-Local Task. All of the tasks were modified extensively from their original neuropsychological design to make them entertaining and stimulating enough for children to enjoy. Each task began at a relatively simple level of difficulty and gradually increased in difficulty across the training as children demonstrated proficiency according to reductions in RT variability</description>

             be obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Understanding Level. The patient and parent cannot understand or follow instructions
             given in the study.

          -  History of Psychiatric Medications: Children must not have taken psychiatric
