    <textblock>
      Individuals with CF develop chronic lung infections and suffer intermittent acute
      exacerbations of their lung disease. Most exacerbations are not treated until they cause
      increased symptoms, and patients seek medical attention. This proposal details a study of
      home lung function and symptom monitoring. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups: 1) home monitoring, in which spirometry and symptoms are recorded; or 2) standard
      care. The home monitoring data will be transmitted electronically to the study center. If
      spirometry or symptoms have deteriorated substantially, treatment for a CF pulmonary
      exacerbation will be initiated. It is anticipated that use of home monitoring will lead to
      earlier, more reliable recognition and treatment of exacerbations, which will translate into
      better lung health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with CF develop chronic lung infections and suffer intermittent exacerbations,
      which require intensive treatment with antibiotics. The most common and useful objective
      measure of CF lung disease is spirometry. Chronic treatment of CF lung disease requires
      airway clearance, mucolytics and antibiotics. These treatments have been quite successful
      and there is evidence that early, aggressive treatment of lung disease results in better
      outcomes. Unfortunately, most exacerbations are not treated until they cause pronounced
      deterioration in symptoms, which prompts patients to seek medical attention. Self-monitoring
      of clinical status has improved outcomes in many other disorders such as asthma, diabetes
      mellitus, and lung transplantation. This is an important, randomized trial of home lung
      function and symptom monitoring in CF. Subjects will be assigned to one of two groups: 1)
      Home monitoring, in which spirometry and symptoms are recorded daily; or 2) Standard Care.
      The home monitoring data will be transmitted electronically twice weekly to the study
      center, where the results will be reviewed. If spirometry or symptoms have deteriorated
      substantially below baseline, treatment for a CF pulmonary exacerbation will be initiated.
      It is anticipated that use of home monitoring will translate into better clinical outcomes.
      We will test the hypothesis that if pulmonary exacerbations are identified and treated
      earlier than the current standard of care, the progression of lung disease will be slowed.

    <description>The primary outcome variable is FEV1 which will be obtained at quarterly study visits. The primary analysis will use a linear mixed effects model incorporating all FEV1 measurements to estimate the 52-week change in FEV1 and test for the differences between the two treatment groups (Early Intervention and Usual Care).</description>
