    <textblock>
      To investigate clinical positioning between trastuzumab (Herceptin) monotherapy (H group)
      and combination therapy of trastuzumab and chemotherapy (H+CT group) based on a randomized
      controlled trial in women over 70 years with human epidermal growth factor receptor type-2
      (HER2) positive primary breast cancer.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety</measure>

    <description>The following variables are evaluated: left ventricular ejection fraction, white-cell count, neutrophil count, platelet count, bilirubin level, alanine aminotransferase level, aspartate aminotransferase level, alkaline phosphatase level, and creatinine level.</description>

    <measure>Health-related QOL (HRQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluations are performed at the time of starting the specified treatment and 2 months, 1 year, and 3 years after the start of treatment.</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost effectiveness analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Data on direct medical costs for the 3-year period after the start of the treatment are obtained from CRF. Data on direct nonmedical costs and indirect costs are obtained from questionnaires 2, 12, and 36 months after starting the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Survey items are as follows.
Direct medical costs: medical costs associated with therapy, the management of adverse events, etc.
Direct nonmedical costs: transportation expenses required for medical examinations, costs of health foods, etc.
Indirect costs: work-loss costs associated with treatment that are incurred directly by the patient and by their caregivers</description>
