      The aim of this study is to identify new genes in Chinese patients that help investigators
      to understand the biological pathway and functions in a population in whom the incidence of
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is increasing. And to explore the genetic variations in
      Chinese patients with IBD.

    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory disorders of the
      gut that cause major life-long disability. Afflicting mostly young people at an age when
      they are most active both in their private and professional life, inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) represents an important public health problem affecting both the patients education,
      working abilities, social life . In the past two decades, the incidence and prevalence of CD
      and UC have been rapidly increasing in Asia. Familial aggregation, twin studies, and recent
      genetic studies suggest that there is an important genetic component to IBD. In the West,
      genome wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 50 genes associated with CD
      including genes involved in bacterial handling, NOD 2, and the genes involved in autophagy
      ATG16L1 and IRGM. Only a few of these genes have been studied in Asian populations. Of those
      which have been studied, such as NOD2, there have been clear differences from Western
      populations. To date most of the GWA studies have been carried out in cohorts of Caucasian
      patients. Genetic studies in ethnically different populations may identify new causal
      variants in IBD, which are likely to lead to further insights into pathophysiology and
      potential treatments. The aim is to perform a GWA study in Chinese patients with CD and UC.
      Identifying new genes in Chinese patients will help the investigators to understand the
      biological pathway and functions in a population in whom the incidence of IBD is increasing.
      As part of a collaborative project with China, we aim to collect blood samples from 1600 IBD
      patients and 2000 control subjects in Hong Kong to conduct a GWA study. Samples of 300 IBD
      patients and 500 controls will be contributed to a collaborative project with China.

      Blood

        1. Up to 50ml of blood sample will be collected and stored at -80°C.

        2. Some blood samples will be transported to Wuhan University for DNA extraction and
           genetic analysis. Some will be used for targeted gene capture, NGS and validation in
           Hong Kong. Some will be sent to Germany for transethnic response mapping. Some will be
           transported to the UK and DNA will be extracted and genetic analysis will be performed
           in the UK.

           Stool

        3. Stool samples will be collected and stored at -80°C. Some will be analysed with PCR for
           norovirus and faecal calprotectin in Hong Kong. Some will be sent to Germany for
           transethnic response mapping.Others will be stored for future analysis.

           Biopsy

        4. 5 biopsies from sigmoid will be collected, snap frozen and stored at -80°C, 1 routine
           biopsy will also be collected for histology. Some will be sent to Germany for analysis.
