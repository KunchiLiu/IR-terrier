  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a second Pilot Study to determine the efficacy of Gleevec® in neurofibromatosis
      (NF1) patients with plexiform neurofibromas using new response assessment modalities with
      the secondary goals of assessing Gleevec toxicity, and characterizing markers of response.
      The rationale for this study arises from the response of human and murine NF1 cells to
      Gleevec® in vitro, the response of a NF1 patient treated with Gleevec® for airway
      compression by a plexiform neurofibroma with a dramatic response not previously seen in NF1
      therapy, and the experience in 37 NF1 patients treated with Gleevec® in the initial pilot
      study. Gleevec will be dosed orally with a starting dose of 100 mg twice daily for patients
      with a BSA &gt; 1.8 m2 or 55 mg/m2 twice daily for patients with BSA &lt; 1.8 m2. For patients
      with a BSA &gt; 1.8 m2 the dose will increase by increments of 100 mg bid every two weeks as
      tolerated up to a maximum dose of 400 mg bid. For patients with a BSA &lt; 1.8 m2 the dose will
      increase by increments of 55 mg/m2 bid every two weeks as tolerated up to a maximum dose of
      220 mg/m2 bid. Treatment will continue for 6 months with an option to continue for 24 months
      if the patient is deriving a clinical benefit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria

          1. Patients &gt; 3 years of age.

          2. Diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

             with tissue blocks available); defined as tumors that are potentially life
