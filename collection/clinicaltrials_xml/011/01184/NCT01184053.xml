  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to see whether women who have already received
      chemotherapy for their endometrial cancer, or who have disease that has spread outside of
      the uterus, will respond to the drug arsenic trioxide (Trisenox®) as judged by shrinkage of
      their tumor.

      This is an open-label, single arm, single institution, phase II trial designed to assess the
      response rate and safety of Trisenox® in women with recurrent endometrial carcinoma.
      Trisenox® will be administered at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days (D1-5)
      every 4 weeks. A 4-week period will be defined as a cycle of treatment. Marker and
      non-marker lesions will be assessed every 2 cycles (every 8 weeks) and the response assigned
      according to Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) RECIST guidelines. Safety will be assessed by
      routine physical, laboratory and ECG evaluations. Up to 10 patients will be enrolled into
      the study. Patients are expected (excluding any unforeseen toxicities) to receive a minimum
      of 2 and a maximum of 6 cycles of Trisenox®. (Patients with at least documented stable
      disease may be eligible for &gt;6 cycles). Patients will be followed for 6 months after their
      last dose of Trisenox®.

      For this trial we would allow one prior cytotoxic regimen since the time of recurrence and
      patients may have had one prior regimen as part of their induction chemotherapy. Patients
      will be treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day for days 1-5 every 28 days and patients may remain on
      trial until progression of disease.

    <description>Any patient who receives at least one dose of Trisenox® on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity. Safety will be assessed by routine physical, laboratory and ECG evaluations. The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.</description>
