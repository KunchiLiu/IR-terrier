    <textblock>
      Although drug therapies have greatly improved blood pressure (BP) control and reduction of
      cardiovascular events, as many as 50% of hypertensives on drug treatment have inadequately
      controlled BP due to poor adherence, insufficiently aggressive treatment, and an aversion on
      the part of many patients to drug treatment. Device-guided breathing is a behavioral
      intervention that guides the breathing into the 6 per minute range, inducing respiratory
      sinus arrythmia (RSA), which is the natural cycle of arrythmia that occurs through the
      influence of breathing on the flow of sympathetic and vagus impulses to the sinoatrial node
      of the heart. It has been shown in several small trials to have substantial effects on BP
      reduction, has no known side-effects, and may represent a cost-effective adjunctive
      treatment for hypertension. an important consideration is that, often, behavioral
      interventions are given for a brief amount of time, but are expected to have long-term
      effects. This does not hold true for medication; one would not give anti-hypertensive
      medication for eight weeks and expect an effect on BP several months later. The development
      of behavioral interventions needs to take into account methods to sustain long-term effects.

      Our aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a guided
      breathing intervention on ambulatory BP (ABP) in hypertensives drawn from primary care and
      specialty hypertension practices, using a sample size powered to detect effects at 8 weeks
      and 4-month follow-up. We also propose to study a physiological mechanism, baroreflex
      sensitivity, that may mediate the effect of the intervention on BP. The design calls for two
      control groups: Usual Care (UC) and a relaxation placebo condition (using a device that
      gives the same type of feedback sounds as the guided breathing feedback device, but modified
      to pace the breathing at approximately 13 breaths per minute, a normal resting rate.) There
      are two intervention conditions using the RESPeRate device that guides the breath into the 6
      breaths/minute range. In both, the initial intervention lasts eight weeks, following which
      participants are further randomized to either: 1) ending the intervention; of 2) continuing
      the intervention for the next 8 weeks. The main outcomes are the change in systolic and
      diastolic BP (measured by Ambulatory BP monitoring) during the waking hours. Outcomes are
      measured at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks
