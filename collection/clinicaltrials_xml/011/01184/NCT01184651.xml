    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to help investigators to understand more about the development of
      characteristics related to being male or female (what is called gender development). The
      investigators will study girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) aged 10 to 13 to
      learn more about the girls' interests and activities, thoughts and feeling about being
      female, and family relationships. This will help investigators to understand the ways in
      which gender development is shaped by hormones and family relationships.

      Interviewers will visit girls in their home when it is convenient for the family. Girls will
      answer questions about the things they do and are interested in, how they think and feel,
      and complete some cognitive tasks. Girls will also provide saliva so we can examine their
      hormones and determine the CAH gene mutation they have. Parents will also be asked to
      complete questionnaires about their own activities and interests and about their daughter's
      behavior.

      Shortly after the home visit, interviewers will telephone girls and their parents on several
      days and ask what the girls did during the day.
