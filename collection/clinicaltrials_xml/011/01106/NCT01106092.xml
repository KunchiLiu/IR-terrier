    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of three formulations of
      GSK Biologicals' GSK2036874A vaccine compared to Zilbrix™/Hib and Poliorix™ vaccines
      administered concomitantly, when administered as a single booster dose to healthy
      poliovirus-primed toddlers aged 12-24 months.

      The study will be conducted in a partially double-blinded manner. The study will be
      double-blinded with respect to the three GSK2036874A formulation groups and open-label with
      respect to the Control Group.

             of booster vaccination.

          -  Subjects who have received three doses of polio vaccine as primary vaccination along
             with the routine vaccinations indicated during the first year of life.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/Legally Acceptable
             Representative (s) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.

             entering into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine(s)

             study period.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the booster dose.

          -  Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days prior
             to booster vaccination, or planned administration during the active study period (up
             to Visit 2).

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational product.

          -  History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and/or
             Haemophilus influenza type b diseases.

          -  Previous booster vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis,
             hepatitis B or H. influenzae diseases.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on

             earlier immunisation against diphtheria and/or tetanus.

          -  Child in care.

          -  Occurrence of any of the following adverse events after a previous administration of
             a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine:

               -  encephalopathy of unknown aetiology occurring within seven days following
                  previous vaccination with pertussis-containing vaccine,

               -  fever &gt;= 40 °C within 48 hours of vaccination not due to another identifiable
                  cause,

               -  collapse or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination,

               -  convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature &gt;= 37.5°C on oral, axillary or tympanic setting,
