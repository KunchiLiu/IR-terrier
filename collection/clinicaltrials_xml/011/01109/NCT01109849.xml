  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous NIH funded Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) trials in children found
      that daily stimulant therapy produced sustained growth deficits. However, no federally
      funded studies have examined the growth suppression associated with modern once a day
      stimulant medications. Therefore, this study will precisely estimate the risks of stimulant
      induced growth suppression (SIGS), examine the underlying mechanisms and develop treatments
      for it. While drug holidays and caloric supplementation are two common treatments for SIGS,
      there has been little systematic investigation of either. It is unknown if they are
      effective or feasible. Therefore, using a randomized adaptive design, we will evaluate the
      efficacy and feasibility of these two practices vs. routine monitoring of growth in 180
      prepubertal children with ADHD. An additional 50 subjects will be treated solely with
      behavioral therapies to evaluate for growth abnormalities associated with ADHD. The study
      will assess will the risk of SIGS with ER stimulants and the underlying mechanisms while
      providing evidenced-based treatments for its management.

      The study will consist of 4 parts:

        1. Screening assessment to determine if a child has ADHD and would be a good candidate to
           have their ADHD treated with an extended release (ER) stimulant medication. If the
           answer to step one is yes, then the child will be randomly assigned to receive either
           medication treatment with an extended release MPH product (OROS MPH). 78% of children
           with start with this option with 22% assigned to behavioral therapy/counseling
           treatments for ADHD. There will be no placebo treatments used in this study. All
           children must be between the ages of 5 and 12 and never have taken stimulant
           medications for ADHD for more than one week to be eligible for the study.

        2. Initial Treatment Phase: The dose of the assigned treatment option will be gradually
           adjusted over the course of the first 3 months until the child's ADHD is well
           controlled. If the child is assigned to medication, he/she will start with a low dose
           of the ER MPH product, and it will be gradually increased until his/her ADHD is in good
           control. Children assigned to medication will be asked to take it every day of the week
           for at least the first 6 months. Children assigned to behavior therapy will be asked to
           avoid using medication for the first 6 months of the study. After month 3 for
           medication and month 6 for behavior therapy (because it can take longer for behavior
           therapy to work), if the first treatment is not effective, the child will be given the
           chance to try the other option. If any treatment is causing a concerning side effect,
           he/she can stop taking it at any time and we will provide him/her with other treatment
           options as part of the study.

        3. Ongoing Treatment Phase: We will continue to provide these ADHD treatments for a total
           of 30 months (2 1/2 years). The dose or type of therapy may be adjusted if needed. The
           child will be monitored every 1-3 months over this time span. Monitoring includes
           doctor visits to assess growth and side effects of medication, regular contact with
           his/her teacher to assess function at school and with you to assess function at home.
           In total, the child will receive study treatments for approximately 30 months and will
           be required to come to our center for a minimum of 18 follow up visits over this time.
           The average visit should take 30 minutes or less.

        4. Weight Recovery Phase: Any child whose body mass index or BMI declines by a concerning
           amount will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 weight promotion treatments to
           stabilize his/her BMI in order to see if this prevents suppression of height (keeps
           them growing to be as tall as they should be). We do not expect children assigned to
           the behavior therapy arm to need these treatments, but the identical weight promotion
           treatments will be available for children in this group if the need arises.

      A) Extra monitoring: A doctor will check the child's growth every month (instead of every 3
      months) until his/her BMI has returned to normal.The child will stay on the current daily
      dose of medication or behavior therapy.

      B) Caloric supplementation: Parents will be provided with a flavored calorie drink to give
      to your child every night and continue on the same daily dose and frequency of medication or
      behavior therapy. The child will have their growth monitored monthly by a study doctor.

      C) Drug Holiday: Participants will now only take medication on school days. Children
      assigned to behavior therapy will not participate in this treatment as they are not taking
      any study medication. The child will have their growth monitored monthly by a study doctor.

      Once the child's weight recovers, these extra treatments will end and he/she will return to
      the prior medication treatment (medication7 days a week or behavior therapy) in step 3 and
      to every 3 month growth assessments. Any time the child's BMI declines again, the extra
      treatments will restart again.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  children meeting criteria for any subtype of ADHD between the ages of 5-12 who are
             stimulant naive

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate
             in this study:

               -  children with a Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (I below 70 as children with
                  IQs less than this would likely not benefit from the behavior therapy
                  intervention

               -  not in full time school or less than 5 or older than 12 years at the time of the
                  screening visit

               -  children who have a history of seizures or other neurological problems and are
                  taking medication to prevent seizures as stimulants could worsen seizures

               -  children with a history of other medical problems for whom psychostimulant
                  treatment may involve considerable risk including cardiac arrhythmias,
                  hypertension, Tourette's Disorder or history of severe tic exacerbations
                  secondary to stimulant exposure

               -  children with a history of other medical problems that could impact appetite or
                  weight such as hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, liver or renal disease. Also,
                  children using prescription medication that can significantly impact appetite or
                  weight are excluded

               -  children with a childhood history or diagnosis of any of the following mental
                  health disorders: pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia or other
                  psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, major
                  depression with serious suicidal thoughts or an eating disorder as stimulants
                  are not safe and effective treatments for these conditions, and these diseases
                  could affect eating habits

               -  children whose Body Mass Index is very low (too light for safe use of stimulant
                  medication) or is too high (overweight so not suitable for weight promotion
                  treatments)

               -  children allergic to milk proteins as they are in the caloric supplement
                  (lactose intolerance okay)

               -  children previously treated with stimulant medications for more than 30 days as
                  this study is focusing on children who have never used stimulant medication
                  before.
