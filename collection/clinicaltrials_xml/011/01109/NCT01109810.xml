  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IDEaL registry is a cooperative, observational registry focused on immunoglobulin use in
      the U.S. The registry is a deliberate and purposeful assembly of clinical and humanistic
      knowledge that is intended to act as a longitudinal database, tracking outcomes of routine
      clinical practice.

      The central goal of the registry is to provide a mechanism that allows for a better
      understanding of how immunoglobulin therapy is being used in a real-world clinical setting.
      The data gathered will help the industry gain a better understanding surrounding the
      therapeutic value of immunoglobulin therapy and subsequently improve practices, reduce
      medical costs, and ultimately improve the clinical outcomes for the patients receiving
      immunoglobulin therapy

      The registry's goal is to significantly contribute to the medical understanding of Ig
      therapy and to improve the quality of care for patients receiving Ig therapy in the United
      States through active publication of registry findings and disease management approaches.

      The IDEaL program represents a unique and powerful method for the collection of:

      Patient Level / Humanistic Data / Quality of Life Physician Level / Practice Patterns
      Clinical Data / Therapeutic Outcomes Reimbursement / Impact on Treatment / Policy Decisions

      Whereby:

      Accelerating innovation Producing faster knowledge gains Improving awareness of patient
      outcomes and disease burden Providing a clearer understanding of therapy impact on patients'
      quality of life.

      The objectives of the Registry are:

      to enhance the understanding of the variability, progression, and natural history of disease
      requiring Ig therapy with the ultimate goal of better guiding and assessing therapeutic
      intervention; to provide the Ig medical community with recommendations for monitoring
      patients and to provide reports on patient outcomes to help optimize patient care; and to
      serve as an active knowledge base that can provide population-management information, which
      can be used to generate patient-management and practice-management tools; and
