  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      to determine if the aldosteronemy proves to be predictive of a cardiac remodeling in the 6
      months following a STEMI (myocardial infarction with know-shift of the segment ST)
      revascularized in acute phase, independently of the conventional predictive parameters (size
      of the infarction measured in IRM, age, HTA…).

      the relation between aldosteronemy and cardiovascular events could be mainly explained by
      the early and long-term noxious effects of the aldosterone on cardiac remodeling

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After myocardial infarction, the evolution towards cardiac failure is generally related to a
      progressive aggravation of the cardiac dysfunction, noxious remodeling. This one depends
      above all on wide on the after-effects on infarction, but also on other parameters such as
      the age and arterial hypertension. The aldosteronemy measured as of the first hours of the
      infarction is associated with a bad long-term forecast. The aldosterone interacts at the
      same time on the mechanisms of cicatrisation and cicatricial fibrosis and on the conditions
      of load (volemy, vascular function). Medications anti-aldosterone can antagonise these
      noxious effects but they are not without adverse effects and one cannot identify the
      patients likely yet to really profit from it: arterial hypertension could be a prerequisite
      (study EPHESUS), like the attack of a critical threshold of size of the infarction
      (principal remodeling factor)
