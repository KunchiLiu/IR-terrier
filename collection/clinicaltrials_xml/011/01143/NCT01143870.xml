  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The percent of glycosylated hemoglobin, also known as a hemoglobin A1C value, is the
      standard way that clinicians assess a patient's diabetes control. Numerous studies have
      shown that maintaining a hemoglobin A1C value less than 7% is associated with lower rates of
      diabetes-related complications. Clinicians use this value to determine whether a patient
      with diabetes requires changes in their disease management. The main problem with this
      practice is that many patients do not understand what this number means. The goal of this
      project is to examine ways to make feedback about glycemic control easier for patients to
      understand. The hope is that improved patient understanding will result in an improvement in
      diabetic control and thus a reduction in disease-associated complications. Patients with a
      diagnosis of diabetes and a hemoglobin A1C value greater than 8% within the preceding three
      months will be eligible for the study. Pregnant women will be excluded. Given the nature of
      the intervention we will also exclude patients with cognitive deficits. In this study,
      patients will be randomized to three groups. The first group with be told their HgbA1C value
      only, the second group will be told a letter grade interpretation of that value, and the
      third group will be shown a face. The face emotions will range from happy to sad reflecting
      the level of control. The main outcome will be trend in hemoglobin A1C values over time.
      Secondary outcomes will include patient understanding of disease state and the number of
      hemoglobin A1C values checked following the intervention.
