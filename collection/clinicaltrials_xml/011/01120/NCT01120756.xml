  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some of the most common and disabling consequences of brain injury are deficits in
      cognition, such as difficulty with sustained attention, memory, organization, and goal
      management. The long-term goal of this research program is to develop and test novel
      neuroscience-based cognitive assessment tools and interventions for improving attentional
      regulation and related &quot;executive function&quot; brain processes involved in goal-directed
      behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain injury often results in a disruption of attentional regulation processes, which
      reduces the efficiency and effectiveness of cognitive functions including learning, memory,
      problem-solving and goal management, leading to significant functional disability. Despite
      the importance of these problems, few effective interventions are available. Current
      projects involve developing novel theory-driven neural biomarkers and behavioral measurement
      tools and training interventions that target attentional control processes. The collection
      of results will help delineate neural mechanisms that support improved attention regulation
      that may serve as neurobiological targets for the development of novel interventions that
      enhance the benefits of rehabilitation.

      In a randomized, controlled intervention study design, individuals with traumatic brain
      injury (TBI) and chronic executive control dysfunction will participate in experimental or
      comparison interventions matched for time, with pre- and post-intervention measurements of
      performance on neurocognitive 'challenge' tests assessing targeted and non-targeted domains,
      functional performance in low structure 'real-world' settings, and functional MRI
      measurements assessing goal-directed information processing. The interventions are:
      Goal-Based Self Management (GBSM) training, paired with the comparison intervention Brain
      Health Education (EDU); Pathfinder Attention Process Training (PATH), paired with the
      comparison intervention Brain Health Education and Motor Skills Training (EDU/MOTOR), and
      Tonic and Phasic Alertness Training (TAPAT) paired with the comparison intervention Object
      Discrimination Training (ODT).

      Participants assigned to GBSM will start with EDU or GBSM. Assignment will be performed on a
      pseudo-randomized basis with pairing of individuals in the assignment process to ensure
      groups are closely matched on age, sex, education level and baseline cognitive status.
      Post-training assessments occur at week 5. Those who enter with EDU will cross-over to GBSM,
      while those enter with GBSM will have 5 weeks of only self-driven practice. There is no
      cross-over from GBSM to EDU in order to better assess potential maintenance effects after
      GBSM participation as well as reduce overall time commitment for patients and trainers given
      the time-intensive nature of the EDU intervention. Both groups participate in longitudinal
      assessments at week 10. Long-term follow-up will be at 6 months.

      Subjects assigned to the PATH or EDU/MOTOR interventions will be randomized into one of
      these two groups. The EDU/MOTOR group will participate in brain health education and motor
      speed computer games; the PATH group will enter the integrated protocol involving
      goal-directed attention regulation training with computer-assisted practice. Both groups
      will participate in Assessment 2 after the first study period. All subjects in the EDU/MOTOR
      group will be offered entrance to PATH at the completion of the first study period, and this
      will provide for an additional within-subjects comparison of effects. Subjects will undergo
      fMRI, neuropsychological and functional assessments at baseline, week 6, week 12 and at 6
      months.

      Finally, to examine the effectiveness of the TAPAT intervention, subjects will be assigned
      to either TAPAT or ODT. TAPAT is designed to improve alertness at two levels: tonic
      attention of sustained attention and phasic alertness, or the capacity to rapidly and
      effectively interrupt an ongoing response pattern. Subjects will be presented objects on a
      computer screen and make speeded responses via button press to non-targeted objects and
      withhold button press to targeted objects. ODT will use the same stimuli and stimulus
      delivery parameters as TAPAT but consist of a stimulus discrimination task in which subjects
      will only be required to discriminate object categories, using a unspeeded, forced-choice
      format. TAPAT and ODT subjects will undergo fMRI, neuropsychological and functional
      assessments at baseline, week 6, and week 12.

    <description>Brain Health Education (EDU) will involve 5-weeks of training (20 hours of group training (2 hour sessions, 2 days per week), 3 hours of individual training (1 hour at the beginning, halfway through and at the end of training), and approximately 20 hours of homework). The EDU intervention involves education in health and brain injury in a classroom format, with study materials for homework. Some subjects will start with EDU and then cross-over to the GBSM.</description>

In brief, the GBSM training protocol is designed to maximize the potential for improving attention regulation skills and the goal-directed functions they support, applying mindfulness-based attention regulation training to practice in redirecting attention to goal-relevant processes especially in the context of distractions is emphasized throughout training. Participants are asked to identify realistic functional goals as feasible individual and group projects, and are then trained in goal management strategies on the functional task(s) of their choice.</description>

    <description>The investigators are developing a series of engaging game-based computerized training tools that target goal-directed attention regulation through intensive application and practice with monitored computer-assisted 'real world' simulated scenarios extended into real life situations. Training will occur in 3 phases, lasting a total of 6-8 weeks, approximately 36 hours of training (12 with in-person trainer interactions, and 24 at home). Patients will start with an on-site training program for 1 week. This phase will focus on goal-directed attention regulation training, including mindfulness-based attentional focus and re-direction. The second phase of training will involve 4-6 weeks of computerized training at home. Participants will complete training 5 days/week. Patients will then return to the study site for therapist-guided training for 1 week.</description>
