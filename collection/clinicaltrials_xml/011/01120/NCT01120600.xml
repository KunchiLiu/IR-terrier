    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that treatment with odanacatib will
      result in increased BMD (bone mineral density) compared to treatment with placebo. This
      study will also evaluate the safety and efficacy of odanacatib for male osteoporosis
      patients.

      The original study was divided into two parts, with the primary analysis of endpoints to
      occur at 24 months and the patients will then remain in the study for an additional 12
      months (Part 2). Amendment 1 of the protocol removed the additional 12 month period and the
      Month 36 BMD analysis was deleted.
