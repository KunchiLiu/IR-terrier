    <textblock>
      The majority of data documenting the outcomes for the adjustable gastric band (LAGB)
      originate from non-publicly funded surgical centres. The investigators aim to investigate
      the clinical outcomes of LAGB from a publicly funded Canadian obesity management program.
      This program recognized obesity as a chronic disease, providing extensive pre-operative
      multidisciplinary assessment and long term patient follow-up. Patients are selected for
      surgical management carefully by a multidisciplinary team and the LAGB is presented as one
      option to surgical management. Further, the investigators will investigate the operational
      impacts, including direct and indirect costs related the LAGB, to determine long term
      impacts on publicly funded hospitals within Canada.
