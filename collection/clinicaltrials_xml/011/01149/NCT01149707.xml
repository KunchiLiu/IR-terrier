  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PUR 0110 is a 100% natural novel investigational medicinal product that has been
      demonstrated in several in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies to have potent
      anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and immunomodulatory effects. This exploratory Phase 2a
      study is a first-in-patient study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, biomarker effect and
      efficacy of PUR 0110 rectal enema in patients with active mild-to-moderate distal ulcerative
      colitis (UC).

      The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging,
      placebo-controlled study. To be eligible for inclusion into the study, patients must either
      be newly diagnosed or have on-going active mild-to-moderate distal ulcerative colitis of at
      least 3 months duration confirmed in either case by flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy at the
      Screening Visit. In addition, patients must have a modified Mayo score of ≥5 to ≤10
      including a sigmoidoscopy inflammation grade and rectal bleeding scores of ≥2 each. Eligible
      patients will be randomly assigned to receive either PUR 0110 250 mg, 500 mg or 1000 mg or
      placebo rectal enema in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Patients will self-administer the assigned study
      medication intrarectally once-daily at bedtime (10:00 p.m +/- 1 hour) for 2 weeks.

      Patients will be evaluated for safety by adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital
      signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and concomitant medications. Efficacy
      evaluations will include the modified Mayo score, patient-defined response and remission,
      Investigator Assessment of Ulcerative Colitis Symptom Score, Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Questionnaire (IBDQ), and biomarkers of inflammation, apoptosis and total cell death, lipid
      peroxidation and in vivo oxidative stress, and antioxidant defense mechanisms in plasma,
      serum, urine, feces and biopsy tissue. Patients will have a flexible sigmoidoscopy and
      biopsy 12 hours after the last dose of study medication.
