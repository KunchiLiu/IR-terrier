  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study include evaluating the dose response of LY2541546 using
      bone mineral density (BMD) change from baseline as compared to placebo, and evaluating the
      overall safety and tolerability of LY2541546 following multiple subcutaneous administrations
      in postmenopausal (PMP) women with low BMD. Following the last dose of study drug,
      participant's will be able to participate in a 12 month extension to collect additional
      safety and efficacy data (no further treatment will be administered during this extension).

          -  Have low bone mineral density (BMD), defined as a T-score, or equivalent BMD absolute
             value (g/cm2), for the lumbar spine of between -3.5 and -2.0, inclusive.
