  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an anti-inflammatory drug, called infliximab,
      will reduce inflammation in the synovial lining in patients with an early stage of
      osteoarthritis of the knee. It will also help determine if the study medication decreases
      the accumulation of synovial fluid and prevents cartilage breakdown.

      This is an unbalanced randomized, double-blind pilot study of Infliximab (100 mg), placebo
      (100 mg) and Methylprednisolone acetate (80 mg). A total of 16 subjects will be randomized;
      8 subjects will be randomized to receive infliximab, 4 subjects will be randomized to
      receive placebo and 4 additional subjects will be randomized to receive Methylprednisolone
      acetate. Subjects will be seen at screening, day 0, day 14, day 28 and day 56. After study
      drug injection at day 0, patients will return for follow-up visits at approximately 2 weeks,
      1 and 2 months in order to obtain clinical endpoint measures for a total of 10 weeks.
      Outcome measures include blood tests, MRI, ultrasound, synovial lining tissue biopsy
      questionnaires and adverse events.

          9. Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures
             (e.g., abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, barrier method with
             spermicide, implantable or injectable contraceptives or surgical sterilization) for
             the duration of the study and should continue such precautions for 6 months after
             receiving the last infusion.

         10. The screening laboratory test results must meet the following criteria

               1. WBC (white blood cell count): &gt;3.5/uL

               8. PT/PTT: WNL

         11. Are considered eligible according to the following TB screening criteria:

               1. Have no history of latent or active TB prior to screening. An exception is made
                  for subjects who have a history of latent TB (defined for the purposes of this
                  study as having had a positive result from either the tuberculin skin test or
                  the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test prior to screening) and documentation of having
                  completed an adequate treatment regimen for latent TB within 3 years prior to
                  the first administration of study agent under this protocol. Adequate treatment
                  for latent TB is defined according to local country guidelines for
                  immunocompromised patients. If no local guidelines for immunocompromised
                  patients exist, US guidelines must be followed. It is the responsibility of the
                  investigator to verify the adequacy of previous anti-TB treatment and provide
                  appropriate documentation.

               2. Have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or
                  physical examination.

               3. Have had no recent close contact with a person with active TB or, if there has
                  been such contact, will be referred to a physician specializing in TB to undergo
                  additional evaluation and, if warranted, receive appropriate treatment for
                  latent TB prior to or simultaneously with the first administration of study
                  agent.

               4. Within 1 month prior to the first administration of study agent, either have
                  negative diagnostic TB test results (defined as both a negative tuberculin skin
                  test and a negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold test, as outlined in Attachment 3 and
                  Attachment 4, respectively), or have a newly identified positive diagnostic TB
                  test result (defined as either a positive tuberculin skin test or a positive
                  QuantiFERON-TB Gold test) during screening in which active TB has been ruled out
                  and for which appropriate treatment for latent TB has been initiated either
                  prior to or simultaneously with the first administration of study agent. The
                  tuberculin skin test and QuantiFERON-TB Gold test are not required at screening
                  for subjects with a history of latent TB and documentation of having completed
                  adequate treatment as described in Inclusion Criterion 12a. Furthermore, these
                  subjects are not required to initiate additional treatment for latent TB.

               5. Have a chest radiograph (both posterior-anterior and lateral views), taken
                  within 3 months prior to the first administration of study agent and read by a
                  qualified radiologist, with no evidence of current active TB or old inactive TB.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Moderate to Severe OA, as determined by severe joint space narrowing (Kellgren grade
             IV) (7) in medial and lateral compartments

          2. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

          3. Systemic inflammatory illness, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis.

          4. Intra-articular injections within 3 months.

          5. Prior treatment with infliximab or other anti-TNF drug.

             infusion (this includes father's who plan on fathering a child within 6 months after
             their last infusion).

          8. Have had any previous treatment with monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments.

          9. History of receiving human/murine recombinant products or a known allergy to murine
             products. A known allergy to murine product is definitely an exclusion criterion

         10. Documentation of a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C.

         11. Have a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the preceding 6 months that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risks associated with study
             participation or study agent administration, or may interfere with interpretation of
             results.

         12. Have a known history of serious infections (e.g., hepatitis, pneumonia, or
             pyelonephritis) in the previous 3 months.

         13. Have or have had an opportunistic infection (e.g., herpes zoster [shingles],
             cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, or mycobacteria
             other than TB) within 6 months prior to screening

         14. Currently receiving Coumadin, Ticlid, Plavix, or heparin/heparin analog within 7 days
             prior to synovial biopsy.

         15. Currently receiving aspirin within 7 days prior to synovial biopsy.

         16. Have a chest radiograph at screening that shows evidence of malignancy or infection.

         17. Have a history of lymphoproliferative disease, including lymphoma or signs suggestive
             of possible lymphoproliferative disease such as lymphadenopathy of unusual size or
             location (e.g., nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck, infraclavicular,
             epitrochlear, or periaortic area), or splenomegaly.

         18. Currently have any known malignancy or have a history of malignancy within the
             previous 5 years, with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has been fully excised with no evidence of recurrence as well as carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix.

         19. Have current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, or cerebral
             disease.

         20. Are unable or unwilling to undergo multiple venipunctures because of poor
             tolerability or lack of easy access.

         21. Use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening or within 5
             half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer.

         22. Presence of a transplanted solid organ (with the exception of a corneal transplant &gt;
             3 months prior to screening).

         23. Have a concomitant diagnosis or history of congestive heart failure Grade III-IV.

         24. Have had a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection or opportunistic infection (e.g.,
