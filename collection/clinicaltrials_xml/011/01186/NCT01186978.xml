  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether a reduction in the radiation dose and field size will
      maintain a high rate of local control while minimizing the risk of acute and late toxicity.

      Hypothesis- The radiation dose and treatment volume can be safely reduced from 30 Gy to 20
      Gy while maintaining high rates of local control in patients who had a negative PET scan
      following rituximab-containing chemotherapy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine if high rates of local control can be maintained after a reduction in the RT dose and volume after 4 to 6 cycles of rituximab containing chemotherapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 year</time_frame>
    <description>This trial will accrue 62 patients over a time period of approximately 5-6 years. The primary objective is to determine whether the observed 5-year LC rate, estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve of time-to-local failure, is as high as that observed in historical controls, i.e., 0.90.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from on-study to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival will be defined as the time from on-study to death due to any case.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To examine patterns of failure</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To examine the patterns of failure, we will tabulate the various ways that patients failed up until the time of the analysis. For example, these ways will include local only, local + distant, and distant only.</description>

    <description>This phase II study will evaluate whether a reduction in the RT dose, concomitant with a decrease in the RT field size, in patients that achieve CR and have a negative post-chemotherapy PET scan following 4 to 6 cycles of rituximab containing chemotherapy, will be associated with a low risk of in-field failure. The goal of this approach is to maintain excellent control rates while minimizing the risk of acute and late toxicity.</description>
