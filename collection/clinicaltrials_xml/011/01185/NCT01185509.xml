  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see what effects trastuzumab in combination with
      vinorelbine has on breast cancer when the participant has circulating tumor cells that are
      positive for the protein called HER2. Trastuzumab is an FDA approved drug that targets HER2.
      The drug combination of trastuzumab and vinorelbine is an effective treatment for patients
      with breast cancers that are positive for HER2. This trial seeks to determine if the
      combination can also benefit participants whose original breast cancer was HER2 negative but
      whose circulating tumor cells are HER2 positive.

      -  Participants will receive two different drugs. Trastuzumab will be administered by vein
           every 3 weeks. Participants will receive a higher dose of trastuzumab on the first day
           of treatment followed by a lower dose for subsequent administration. Vinorelbine will
           be administered by vein once a week.

        -  Each treatment cycle lasts 3 weeks during which time participants will be receiving
           Vinorelbine weekly and Trastuzumab every 3 weeks. Participants will continue to receive
           Vinorelbine weekly and Trastuzumab every 3 weeks as long as their cancer is not growing
           and they are not experiencing severe side effects.

        -  Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) will be collected at study entry, at 6 weeks or up to
           one week prior, and when study treatment is stopped.

        -  ECHO or MUGA scan is performed at study entry and repeated at 18 weeks and then as
           needed.

        -  CT or MRI will be performed at study entry and then repeated every 6 weeks for the
           first 18 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter. A bone scan or CT/MRI scan of the
           brain will be performed if the doctor determines this is medically necessary.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic invasive mammary carcinoma. The
             primary cancer must be HER2 negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or
             immunohistochemistry.

          -  Patients must have CTCs with HER2 amplification by FISH.

          -  Measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in
             at least one dimension as 20mm or greater with conventional techniques of as 10mm or
             greater with spiral CT scan.

          -  Study participants must have either archival primary tumor or metastatic tumor tissue
             available to allow analysis to confirm their HER2 status.

          -  Patients must have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic
             breast cancer or evidence of disease progression within 6 months of completing
             adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients can receive any number of biological or hormonal
