  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pralatrexate and oxaliplatin work in treating patients
      with esophageal, stomach, or gastroesophageal junction cancer that cannot be removed by
      surgery or has spread from the primary site (place where it started) to other places in the
      body. Pralatrexate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pralatrexate with oxaliplatin may be an effective
      treatment for esophageal, stomach, or gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate in patients with advanced esophago-gastric cancer
      (EGC) to combination pralatrexate and oxaliplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen. II. To determine the
      time-to-progression and overall survival using this regimen.

      III. To examine whether functionally relevant polymorphisms of genes of the folate
      metabolism pathway correlate with efficacy and toxicity of pralatrexate.

      IV. To examine whether response to pralatrexate can be predicted by micro-ribonucleic acid
      (microRNA) expression profiling of the epithelial component of the tumor.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pralatrexate intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2
      hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Oxaliplatin will be discontinued after 12 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then
      periodically thereafter for up to 5 years.

    <description>Correlations of the haplotype-tagged single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) with response, OS, and TTP will be explored by multivariate logistic and Cox proportional hazards models, to explore the impact of these germline SNPs on binary and time to event outcomes. These exploratory comparisons will be carried out on the entire cohort, as well as within different patient subgroups such as responders, and progression-free and stable patients if feasible.</description>

    <description>Initial studies will be conducted to test and optimize individual miRNAs for maximum sensitivity and specificity to predict chemosensitivity, inferring differences in the distributions of biomarkers with stringent statistical multiple testing error control procedures. A 2-sample two-ways test of mean differences in mir log expression by discrete treatment outcome (toxicity or efficacy) will be performed, with a Wilcoxon rank sum test.</description>
