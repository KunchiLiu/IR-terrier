  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organ transplantation offers the only hope for a normal life for patients with end-stage
      renal disease on dialysis (ESRD). For patients with antibodies to human leukocyte antigens
      (HLA), transplantation is extremely difficult or impossible since pre-formed antibodies will
      cause severe rejection and loss of transplanted organs. Intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG)
      can reduce or eliminate these antibodies in most patients and allow for successful
      transplantation. This breakthrough has allowed patients previously considered not
      transplantable to receive life-saving transplants. However, IVIG alone does not always
      eradicate the anti-HLA antibodies to a degree that will allow transplantation to proceed.

      In this study, the investigators propose to add an additional treatment (Rituxan), a
      humanized antibody directed at the CD20 antigen that is present on most B-cells (B-cells
      make antibodies, this Rituxan should help eliminate the source of anti-HLA by deleting the
      cells that make it).

      Both IVIG and Rituxan are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      numerous immunologic disorders and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. However, neither is
      yet approved by the FDA for desensitization of highly-HLA sensitized transplant patients.

      Previously conducted pilot study demonstrated that IVIG + Rituxan can fill an important gap
      in our current therapeutic approach for management of highly sensitized patients and it may
      become the standard approach to manage these patients.

      This study has been recently updated after observation that subjects transplanted after
      desensitization with IVIG alone experienced higher rates of antibody rejection and graft
      loss.

      The primary objective of this revised protocol will be to examine the safety and efficacy of
      IVIG 2gm/kg (maximum dose 140g) given on day#0 &amp; day #30 plus Rituximab 1gm given on day
      #15. Transplanted patients will receive additional doses of Rituximab 1gm at 3 months
      post-transplant if donor specific antibody (DSA)levels remain or become positive or at 6M if
      de novo DSA occur. All transplanted patients who remain DSA negative, will not receive
      additional Rituximab. All transplanted patients will have a protocol biopsy at transplant
      and at 12 months. All subjects will have to complete 5 visits in a pre-transplant phase of
      the study. Patients who are transplanted will have additional 5 post-transplant visits. The
      following are research-related procedures:

        1. Rituxan infusion.

        2. Kidney allograft biopsy (Intra-op and 12 months post transplant)

        3. Rituxan level, HACA levels

        4. Immunologic biomarkers (CD19+, CD38+, CD27+)

      Although Dr. Jordan commonly uses both treatment regimens at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
      only the IVIG treatment is considered to be standard of care for highly HLA-sensitized
      patients. The investigational component of this study is the addition of the Rituxan and
      currently the study has been ammended to a safety and efficacy study focusing on decreasing
      HLA antibodies pre-transplant and minimizing DSA post transplant.

      This single center, Phase I/II, exploratory study has been modified to a safety/efficacy
      study providing all patients with IVIG and Rituximab. The trial will examine the safety and
      efficacy of human polyclonal IVIG 10%, when given at [2.0 gm/kgx2], + Rituximab 1gm to
      reduce donor-specific antibodies (DSA) to a level that is permissive for transplantation in
      75 subjects (adults only ages &gt;18 yrs) who are highly-HLA sensitized and are awaiting
      deceased donor kidney transplant. Once transplant offers are entertained, a donor-specific
      crossmatch will be performed. If acceptable crossmatches and DSA levels are seen, the
      patients will proceed to DD transplantation. Patients receiving transplants will receive an
      additional dose of IVIG at transplantation (within 10 days) and will receive additional
      doses of Rituximab 1g at 3M post transplant if DSA levels remain or become positive at 6M if
      de novo DSA occur. Patients who are desensitized and not transplanted at 9M after
      desensitization will have completed the study and can be treated as best judged by their
      physician.
