  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study of adult (≥ 18 years) women with stage II-III breast cancer who will receive
      preoperative chemotherapy prior to mastectomy. Patients will have real-time serum glycan
      profiling, expression of tissue MUC 1 oncoprotein isoforms to predict neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy response and additional mammography and HD PET/CT examinations to assess
      response. The investigators hypothesize that a functional tumor assessment utilizing
      high-definition positron emission tomography/computed tomography (HD PET/CT), real-time
      serum glycan profiling, and expression of tissue MUC 1 oncoprotein isoforms will predict
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in breast cancer patients.

      This is a non-randomized clinical trial pilot study. Consenting adult (≥ 18 years) women
      with stage II-III breast cancer undergoing will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a
      standard ACT regimen prior to mastectomy. Prior to beginning chemotherapy, patients will
      receive a baseline mammogram, breast HD PET/CT, and blood draw. Not more than 7 days prior
      to the second cycle of chemotherapy, patients will have both HD PET/CT and diagnostic
      mammography images taken to assess early response to treatment. Patients will have two
      additional mammography and HD PET/CT examinations: one after the first cycle of
      chemotherapy, and another upon completion of the last cycle of chemotherapy but before
      mastectomy. The investigators will collect data on the size (maximum diameter, estimated
      volume) and 18FDG uptake (SUV) of the known primary breast cancer on HD PET/CT. Blood will
      be sampled from patients at 12 separate time points during the study for glycan analysis. At
      least 3 ml will be taken with each blood draw. The first blood draw will be taken when the
      patient agrees to enroll in the study. The second blood draw will be taken prior to the
      first cycle of chemotherapy. Thereafter, blood will be drawn for serum glycan analysis after
      each cycle of chemotherapy is completed. After the patient undergoes mastectomy, tissue will
      be collected for MUC-1 assay and two additional blood draws will be taken.

          -  Stage II or III breast cancer and considered a candidate for curative mastectomy.

          -  Selected mastectomy for surgical option of treatment.

          -  Patient must agree to receive standard or dose-dense adriamycin, cyclophosphamide,
             and taxane-based chemotherapy given preoperatively.

          -  Patient must have the following preoperative laboratory values confirmed within 28
             days prior to registration: Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN. Platelets ≥ 90,000/mm3. White
