    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bendamustine hydrochloride, etoposide,
      dexamethasone, and filgrastim together for peripheral stem cell mobilization works in
      treating patients with refractory or recurrent lymphoma or multiple myeloma. Giving
      chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, etoposide, and dexamethasone, before a
      peripheral stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from
      dividing or killing them. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim, and certain
      chemotherapy drugs helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be
      collected and stored

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the frequency of bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) combined with GCSF
      (filgrastim) and dexamethasone to successfully mobilize peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs)
      (as determined by collecting a minimum of 2 x 10^6 cluster of differentiation (CD)34+/kg).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate to bendamustine by diagnosis using established
      disease-specific response criteria.

      II. To examine the number of apheresis cycles required to collect a minimum of 2 x 10^6
      CD34+ cells/kg and ideally &gt;= 5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg (when achievable).

      III. To assess the impact of bendamustine on B and T-lymphocyte populations in the
      peripheral blood (CD20+ cells, natural killer [NK] cells, CD4+25+ foxP3- regulatory cells,
      and CD8 cells).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1
      and 2, etoposide IV over 60-240 minutes on days 1-3, dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1-4,
      and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 5 and continuing until peripheral blood
      stem cell collection is complete. Patients undergo leukapheresis daily for a minimum of 3
      days or until &gt; 5 x 10^6 CD34+/kg has been collected.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 5 years.
