      The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of combined behavioral +
      drug therapy compared to behavioral treatment alone and drug therapy alone as a way to
      improve outcomes in the treatment of OAB symptoms in men. We hypothesize that combined
      therapy will result in better outcomes than either behavioral or drug therapy alone. The
      second aim is to compare two methods of implementing combined therapy: simultaneously as
      initial therapy vs. stepped therapy, in which therapies are combined following initial
      behavioral or drug therapy alone. The third aim is to examine the costs and
      cost-effectiveness of combined behavioral + drug therapy compared to behavioral or drug
      therapy alone.

    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a very common, distressing condition that manifests as
      bothersome symptoms of urgency, frequent urination, urge incontinence, and nocturia, and
      impacts the lives of millions of men. OAB symptoms are most often treated with pharmacologic
      therapies (alpha-blocking agents and/or antimuscarinic agents) or behavioral treatments.
      Although drug therapies (even combined drug therapies) and behavioral treatments reduce OAB
      symptoms, few patients are completely cured with either treatment alone. Therefore, there is
      a need to improve interventions for this common problem. The primary purpose of this study
      is to test the effectiveness of combining behavioral treatment and drug therapy as a way to
      improve outcomes in the treatment of OAB symptoms in men. This is a 3-site, 2-stage, 3-arm
      randomized clinical trial of behavioral treatment, drug therapy, and combined drug +
      behavioral therapy for men with OAB, to examine the efficacy of combined therapy and whether
      it yields higher success rates than either therapy alone. 201 men with OAB will be enrolled
      and randomized to 1)drug therapy alone followed by combined therapy, 2)behavioral treatment
      alone followed by combined therapy, or 3)combined therapy as initial treatment.

    <description>Behavioral treatment is implemented in 4 clinic visits over a period of 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of combined behavioral + drug therapy. Behavioral treatment consists of behavioral training and includes skills and strategies for postponing urination, controlling urgency and preventing urge incontinence. This includes pelvic floor muscle training, incremental delayed voiding, and daily bladder diaries, supplemented with instructions for daily home practice between clinic visits. In addition to daytime training, nocturia is managed with fluid restriction (3 hours before bedtime and during the night) and with urge strategies.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Community-dwelling men

          2. Age 40 years or older

          3. Patient-reported urgency and 9.0 or more voids per 24-hour day (on average) on the
             7-day baseline bladder diary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Urinary flow rate &lt; 8.0 mL/sec on a void greater than 125 ml.

          2. Post-void residual volume greater than 150 mL (based on bladder ultrasound after
             voiding in the presence of a normal urge to urinate).

          3. Urinary tract infection (defined as growth of greater than 10,000 colonies per ml of
             a urinary pathogen on urine culture). Patients will be referred for treatment with
             antibiotics and may be enrolled if OAB symptoms persist after the infection is
             resolved.

          4. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), simple prostatectomy, or other BPH
             related surgery within the past 5 years.

          5. Current active treatment for prostate cancer.

          6. History of radical prostatectomy.

          7. Previous artificial urinary sphincter, sling procedure, bladder-injection of
             botulinum toxin, or implanted sacral neuromodulation device.

          8. Poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin &gt;9.0 within last 3 months).
             Subjects with poorly controlled diabetes will be offered enrollment if the OAB
             symptoms persist after the diabetes is controlled appropriately.

          9. Hematuria on microscopic examination in the absence of infection. A urologic
             consultation will be recommended and enrollment will depend on clearance by a
             urologist and agreement by the Site PI that entry into the treatment protocol is not
             contraindicated.

         10. Any unstable medical condition (particularly: cancers under active treatment,
             decompensated congestive heart failure, history of malignant arrhythmias, unstable
             angina, diagnosed by history or physical exam).

         11. Neurologic conditions such as Parkinson's, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or
             myasthenia gravis.

         12. Impaired mental status. Patients who screen as probable dementia on the Mini-Cog.

         13. Contraindications to the study drugs (tolterodine and tamsulosin) including history
             of postural hypotension with syncope, history of acute urinary retention requiring
             catheterization, narrow angle glaucoma, or history of gastric retention.

             been discontinued for 2 weeks.

         16. Current use of an anti-muscarinic agent for OAB. Evaluation will be delayed until the
             drug has been discontinued for 2 weeks.

         17. If on a diuretic, dose has not been stable for at least 4 weeks.

         18. If taking dutasteride or finasteride, dose has not been stable for at least 6 months.

         19. If on an antibiotic for prostatitis. Patients will be offered re-evaluation if OAB
             symptoms persist when antibiotics are completed.

         20. Full course of behavioral training.
