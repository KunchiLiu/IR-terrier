      The purpose of this cohort study is to determine vaccine-specific rates of pertussis disease
      during the period of the study, among Wisconsin residents younger than 60 months of age (the
      Surveillance Population), and to descriptively compare the proportion of such persons
      vaccinated with Pentacel® vaccine who acquire pertussis disease to the proportion of such
      persons vaccinated with any other Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis
      (DTaP) vaccine who acquire pertussis disease.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the rates and relative risk of pertussis disease among Surveillance Population
      members who have received Pentacel vaccine or another pertussis vaccine.

      The study will be conducted by the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public
      Health, in collaboration with the Wisconsin Division of Public Health (WDPH).

      Epidemiological and laboratory surveillance for pertussis disease among Wisconsin residents
      is routinely conducted by the WDPH. During the period of the study, de-identified data
      regarding all incident pertussis cases will be obtained from WDPH and vaccination coverage
      rates, by vaccine regimen, age group, and period of time, will be obtained from ongoing
      marketplace surveillance conducted on behalf of the Sponsor by a national sample-survey
      organization. Using these data, rates of pertussis disease will be determined.

      No vaccine will be administered as part of this study.
