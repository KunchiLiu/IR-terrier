  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common incident cancer and the second most common cause
      of cancer death in the United States, with approximately 150,000 new cases and 57,000 deaths
      per year. High calcium intake and magnesium may protect against colorectal cancer and
      adenoma, however, results have been inconsistent. We found that genetic makeup, associated
      with magnesium absorption and re-absorption, significantly interacted with the calcium and
      magnesium ratio in relation to the both adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. Participants
      who carried at least one 1482Ile allele (G-&gt;A)of TRPM7 and who consumed diets with a high
      calcium/magnesium ratio were at a higher risk of adenoma and hyperplastic polyps than were
      participants who did not carry the polymorphism. We hypothesize that the reduction in the
      dietary Ca/Mg ratio may change the markers directly related to tumorigenesis. The primary
      aims of this study are to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled intervention trial to test
      whether reducing the Ca/mg intake ratio through magnesium supplementation has effects on the
      related biomarkers. We will also examine whether the effect of modulating Ca/Mg intake ratio
      may be more pronounced among those who carry the 1482Ile allele compared those who don't
      carry the 1482Ile allele. Results from our study will help to identify people at a high risk
      of colorectal adenoma and to develop personalized strategies to prevent occurrence of
      colorectal adenoma, and thus, colorectal cancer through dietary change or nutritional
      fortification.
