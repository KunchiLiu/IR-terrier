      This study will attempt to learn how to better treat trauma patients with delirium who are
      on a breathing machine. Delirium, also known as acute, temporary brain dysfunction, is a
      common reason why ventilated patients can not be weaned from the breathing machine even
      though their lungs may be healthy enough to breathe without the machine. The study hopes to
      show that by decreasing the patient's delirium it will lead to quicker weaning from the
      breathing machine and possibly a quicker overall recovery as well. Patients enrolled in this
      study will be treated with Clonidine or placebo. Clonidine is a drug that produces
      significant calming effects, decreases anxiety, and reduces pain, but with a lower incidence
      of delirium than other medications used in the ICU for this purpose. Clonidine is not
      approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration for treatment of delirium, but is
      commonly used for this purpose.

    <textblock>
      Obtaining the appropriate level of sedation and analgesia in severely injured trauma
      patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging due to the diversity
      of injuries as well as the breadth of comorbidities present in this population. Clonidine
      may be a useful adjuvant to traditional analgesics such as opioids and sedatives such as
      benzodiazepines and propofol. Ventilator dependent trauma patients frequently fail
      extubation trials secondary to inappropriate sedation, inadequate analgesia or undertreated
      delirium. Patients that fail extubation for these reasons have a potentially preventable
      prolonged ventilator, ICU and hospital course. Ventilated trauma patients that meet criteria
      for our institution's SBT protocol and have the diagnosis of delirium will be considered for
      the trial if they have a documented failed SBT. We hypothesize treatment of this patient
      population with transdermal Clonidine will decrease delirium in trauma patients during their
      ICU stay. Patients enrolled in the treatment group will receive an oral loading dose of
      Clonidine 0.3 mg and placement of a Clonidine Transdermal system at a dose of 0.3-mg/day
      (Catapres TTS-3) covered by a patch overlay. In 12 hours the patient will receive a second
      and final dose of Clonidine 0.3 mg. The placebo group will receive a placebo oral tablet and
      the overlay patch only and in 12 hours they will receive a second and final placebo tablet.
      A total of 120 patients will be enrolled, 60 patients in each group. All patients will
      complete the study at end of Day 14 or upon discharge from the hospital, whichever comes
      sooner. Ventilator times will be measured in each group as well as the prevalence of
      delirium by the amount of positive CAM-ICU scores over the course of the trial.
