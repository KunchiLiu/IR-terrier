  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LY2603618 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage
      checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). It is being developed as a chemotherapeutic-enhancing agent in
      the treatment of cancer. Ongoing Phase 1 studies have shown the feasibility of combining
      LY2603618 with either gemcitabine or pemetrexed. The objective of this study is to find the
      dose of LY2603618 that can be safely combined with standard doses of pemetrexed and
      cisplatin and to test if this triplet offers a significant improvement in progression-free
      survival in participants with Stage IV nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the
      first-line of palliative treatment.

          -  Phase 2 portion:

               -  Have a histological diagnosis of NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell
                  histology which is classified as Stage IV according to the seventh edition of

             study, at the discretion of the investigator (for example, unstable angina pectoris
             or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus). Special attention should be paid to kidney and
             heart conditions that may be worsened with cisplatin treatment or hydration

          -  Have central nervous system (CNS) metastases (unless the participant has completed
             successful local therapy for CNS metastases and has been off corticosteroids for at
             least 4 weeks before starting study therapy). A screening computed tomography (CT)
             scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before enrollment in the absence of a
             clinical suspicion of brain metastases is not required

          -  Have current active infection that would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             compromise the patient's ability to tolerate therapy

          -  Have known allergy to pemetrexed, cisplatin, LY2603618, or any ingredient of
             pemetrexed, cisplatin, or LY2603618

          -  Have clinically significant (by physical exam) third-space fluid collections; for
             example, ascites or pleural effusions that cannot be controlled by drainage or other
             procedures prior to study entry

          -  Patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) who cannot interrupt
             the treatment appropriately according to the guidelines

          -  Have received a recent yellow-fever vaccination (within 28 days of enrollment) or are
             receiving concurrent yellow-fever vaccination

          -  Phase 1 portion:

               -  Have received more than 2 previous lines of chemotherapy for the
                  advanced/metastatic disease

               -  Have received more than 6 cycles of therapy containing an alkylating agent
