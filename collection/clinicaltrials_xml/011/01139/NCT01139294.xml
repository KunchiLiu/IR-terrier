    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to non-invasively study the reflective changes in cardiac
      output as response to fluid therapy in the pediatric moderate hypovolemia/dehydrated
      pediatric patients using sub-q rehydration using Hylenex augmented subcutaneous infusion of
      fluids and electrolytes compared to intravenous methods.

      This is an open-labeled, single-center Phase IV clinical trial. The study will consist of
      patients with moderate hypovolemia/dehydration requiring parenteral rehydration. It is
      expected that this study will describe the onset or change in cardiac output using Hylenex
      augmented subcutaneous rehydration from ages 2 months up to 3 years and at a flow rate
      satisfying clinical needs, especially in reference to changes in cardiac output observed in
      standard intravenous rehydration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients presenting to the ED with moderate dehydration (gorelick dehydration
             classification : presence of 3-6 moderate signs and symptoms) requiring parenteral
             rehydration.

          -  Patient has not successfully received oral or IV fluids immediately prior to
             enrollment

          -  patient's legally authorized representative has signed the informed consent and is
             willing for the patient to receive Hylenex augmented sub-q rehydration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patient in shock or a life-threatening situation

          -  immunocompromised, history of abscess or cellulitis, abscess &amp;/or cellulitis caused
             by MRSA, family history of abscess or cellulitis

          -  requires IV therapy for another indication

          -  has an indwelling catheter

          -  has already received rehydration therapy by IV route within the last 48 hours or
             substantial oral fluid in the immediate time period of enrollment

          -  has a condition precluding sub-q injection or infusion site evaluation in the upper
             middle back area or at another elected site of infusion

          -  has a reason for hospital admission or extended ED stay other than dehydration

          -  has an known hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase or another ingredient in the

          -  has a medical history, screening physical exam finding or historical clinical lab
             result that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude the patients safe
             participation in the is study or which might adversely effect the interpretation of
             the study results
