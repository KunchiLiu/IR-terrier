  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, open-label, non-comparative, Phase IIIb trial to assess the
      convenience, safety and efficacy of the new Gonal-F fbm [recombinant follicle stimulating
      hormone (r-FSH)] liquid formulation, in common setting for ovulation induction (OI) and also
      in in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian stimulation in IVF or intracytosolic sperm injection (ICSI) currently includes
      suppression of endogenous luteinising hormone (LH) suppression by administration of either a
      gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or a GnRH antagonist, followed by stimulation
      of multiple follicular development by exogenous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
      administration. When an adequate follicular development is achieved, a single human
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) dose is administered to mimic the endogenic LH surge and induce
      final oocyte maturation. In common setting, the purpose of the ovarian stimulation is to
      obtain a monofollicular development, for ovulation induction and the first line treatment is
      represented by clomiphene. Follicle stimulating hormone gonadotropins are indicated in case
      of clomiphene failure.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess, in common setting, convenience, safety, and efficacy of protocols using
           Gonal-F fbm liquid formulation applied by pen for OI and IVF/ICSI procedures.

      The study was designed to primarily collect safety data related to the usage of the Gonal-F
      fbm liquid formulation, in addition to the post treatment assessment of convenience in
      subjects treated with Gonal-F fbm. In OI or intrauterine insemination (IUI), the objective
      of ovarian stimulation was monofollicular development and the initiation of treatment took
      place in the the first 7 days of the cycle. The initial daily dose of Gonal-F was 75-150
      International Unit (IU) and then was increased preferably by 37.5 IU or 50 IU or 75 IU
      (maximal dose should not exceeding 225 IU) at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary,
      to obtain an adequate but not excessive response. In IVF or ICSI the objective was
      superovulation, with multiple follicules development and the initiation of treatment at
      J2-J3 of the cycle was at the starting dose of 150-225 IU. The study was continued till the
      confirmation of pregnancy or non pregnancy.
