  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1997, the FDA approved the use of Trabecular Metal™ (Zimmer, Trabecular Metal Technology,
      Inc., Parsippany, NJ) for acetabular cups, a porous tantalum structural biomaterial that was
      developed to address the limitations of other implant materials, with the potential to
      improve implant fixation.

      Porous tantalum (80% porosity) offers potentially greater ingrowth and bone graft
      incorporation, believed to be restricted by the low porosity of other commonly used implants
      (30%). Additionally, the low modulus of elasticity property (3 MPa) of porous tantalum
      provides more normal physiological loading conditions which theoretically reduce stress
      shielding and resultant bone loss surrounding the implant. These properties are much desired
      advantages for implants used in cementless THA.

      Various porous tantalum implants have shown favorable clinical results. Unger et al.
      reported excellent bone graft incorporation of the acetabular component based on serial
      radiograph data at a minimum 1-year follow-up.

      Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is a well-established method for detecting
      periprosthetic bone mass changes around the femoral and acetabular THA components.

      The primary objective of this study is to quantify and compare periprosthetic bone mineral
      density (BMD) changes in THA revision patients receiving Trabecular Metal™ and metal-backed
      acetabular components, measured using DEXA scanning techniques. Additionally, this study
      will analyze and compare clinical outcomes of these patients, based on SF-12v2 and HOOS.

             history.

          -  Patient is a revision total hip recipient, which requires a metal-backed
             hemispherical cup.

          -  Patient or patient's legal representative has signed the Informed Consent form. The
             patient is capable of making informed decisions regarding his/her healthcare.

        Exclusion Criteria:
