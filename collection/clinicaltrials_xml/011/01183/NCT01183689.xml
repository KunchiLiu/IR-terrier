    <textblock>
      The Study of Novel Approaches for Prevention (SNAP) is randomized trial designed to test
      whether behavioral interventions based on self-regulation can prevent weight gain in young
      adults (18-35 years; body mass index (BMI) 21-30 kg/m2). Two different self-regulation
      interventions for weight gain prevention will be compared in this trial; one intervention
      will focus on making small, consistent, changes in eating and exercise behavior to prevent
      weight gain or reverse weight gain if it occurs, whereas the other will emphasize larger
      changes in eating and exercise that occur periodically, with a goal of producing weight loss
      and thereby providing a buffer against anticipated weight gains. The primary aim of the
      trial is to test whether the magnitude of weight gain from baseline across an average
      three-year follow-up differs across the three groups, with the hypotheses that weight gain
      will be greater in the Control group than in either intervention and greater in the Small
      Changes than Large Changes group.

      SNAP-E (Extension) will determine whether the effects of the intervention can be maintained
      over an additional 3 years (i.e. through a total of 6 years).

Participants randomized to this group will receive one face-to-face session that will provide general education of self-weighing and information about both the small and large changes approach. Participants will also be provided with quarterly newsletters describing study events and very limited information on health eating.</description>
