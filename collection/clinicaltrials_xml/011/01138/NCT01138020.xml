    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a structured rehabilitation
      program on cognitive function and quality of life in individuals with blast-induced
      traumatic brain injury (bTBI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common impairments following blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) are
      cognitive deficits in the domain of executive functioning, learning and memory, and
      functional and psychosocial disabilities that are closely related to these cognitive
      deficits. There are no treatment protocols available to address the multiple cognitive
      impairments in bTBI, but cognitive rehabilitation has proven efficacious in the treatment of
      non-blast TBI. The cognitive training modules the investigators plan to evaluate have
      improved organization and memory function in patients with non-blast TBI, but it is unknown
      whether their efficacy exceeds that of programs that focus only on education and support.
      This study is a between group comparison of a cognitive rehabilitation treatment designed
      specifically to address the most common cognitive complaints in executive and memory
      function, and an active control group receiving educational intervention geared at personal
      management of TBI-related symptoms.
