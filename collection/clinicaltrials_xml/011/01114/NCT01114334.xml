      The purpose of the study is to determine whether motivational interviewing with
      guideline-based medical management for depression will significantly improve time to
      depression recovery and increase the proportion of subjects in recovery compared to
      guideline-based medical management alone over 9 months.

    <description>The primary outcome is depression remission ascertained with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. A score of less than 5 is considered to represent remission.</description>

    <measure>Adherence to treatment with antidepressant medication</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, and 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Antidepressant Adherence will be measured with Computerized Pharmacy Records. Adherence will be operationalized as &quot;non-persistence,&quot; or time to discontinuation. Non-persistence will be considered to have occurred if the days of medication supply from the previous prescription plus a 30-day grace period exceed the number of days between the previous prescription date and the current prescription fill date. Filling no prescriptions, 'initiation failure,' will be treated as non-persistence.</description>

    <description>Manual-based GBMM training will be provided to both intervention and control physicians. A note on the patient's chart will apprise the primary care provider that the patient screened positive for moderate or more severe depressive symptoms, and has agreed to participate in the study.
The evidence-based algorithm covers medical management of depression including indications for treatment, selection of initial therapy, starting dosages, dose escalation, switching or augmenting treatment, assessing efficacy, treatment goals and duration, a schedule of follow-up visits and referral indications</description>

    <description>We used the Colorado Clinical Guidelines Collaborative treatment guideline for Major Depression. It recommends treatment options e.g. specialty mental health counseling, antidepressant treatment, physical activity, depending upon presenting symptoms severity and other factors. The assessor notifies the clinician at the baseline visit about the patient's PHQ-9 depressive symptom severity score.</description>

    <description>Intervention providers receive training to utilize Motivational Interviewing to frame discussions around depression, and to improve treatment uptake and treatment adherence for depression. Primary care providers are encouraged to apply MI to a broad conceptualization of 'treatment' including specialty mental health referral, antidepressant treatment, physical activity, and to targeting contributing factors e.g. loss of job or physical health problems.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women and men aged 18 or older presenting at one of the seven DHH study clinics with

          2. The PHQ-9 is used to define depression category with a sensitivity and specificity
             for MDD of at least 88%. Patients must have PHQ-9≥10 to ensure sufficient severity to
             warrant intervention.

          3. A new treatment episode is defined as no treatment with an antidepressant medication

             developmental disorders.

         11. Subjects with uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
