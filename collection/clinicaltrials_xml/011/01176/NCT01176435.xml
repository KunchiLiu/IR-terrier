  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the effect of two doses of levodopa (L-DOPA) in a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial to see if vision can be improved in
      individuals with albinism. The hypothesis is that providing L-DOPA to the retinas of these
      individuals may increase melanin pigment production. Increased melanin has previously been
      shown to be associated with improved vision.

    <textblock>
      A group of 45 individuals with the clinical findings of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) will
      be randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups: treatment with 0.76 mg/kg/d with 25%
      carbidopa, 0.51 mg/kg/d levodopa with 25% carbidopa [divided into 3 doses/d), or placebo.
      Subjects will be between ages 3 and 60 years. Blood will be drawn to determine the
      mutation(s) in the genes that causes OCA. Primary outcome will be binocular best-corrected
      visual acuity measured with the EVA. Enrollment and 20 week examination will be complete eye
      exam with fundus photos. At weeks 5, 10, and 15, exams will include just vital signs and
      BCVA. At all visits, a review of potential side effects will be conducted. Between visits,
      subjects will be contacted to determine if any side effects have occurred. The study will
      remain double masked until the last study examination on the last subject has been
      performed. At that time, the data will be statistically analyzed and subjects will be
      informed re: treatment assignment, mutations found, and the study results.
