  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a retrospective study, a combined 20 and 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy procedure was
      performed in 21 eyes for various indications and proposed as a transition procedure to
      23-gauge transconjunctival vitrectomy. Through use of combination of procedures
      postoperative complications, surgical trauma and healing time was decreased; operating time
      was reduced; costs were decreased.

        Patients who were in the range 44 to 80 years, who had to undergo vitrectomy operation
        with different diagnosis were included in the study. Each participant had a complete
        ophthalmological examination which included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit lamp
        examination with and without pupil dilation, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement with
        applanation tonometry and stereoscopic evaluation of the ocular fundus before decision of
        operation.
