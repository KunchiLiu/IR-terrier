      The specific aims of this study are to:

        1. Definitively determine the therapeutic benefit of the intensive treatment relative to
           the standard treatment in the proportion of patients with death and disability (mRS
           4-6) at 3 months among subjects with ICH who are treated within 4.5 hours of symptom
           onset.

        2. Evaluate the therapeutic benefit of the intensive treatment relative to the standard
           treatment in the subjects' quality of life as measured by EuroQol at 3 months.

        3. Evaluate the therapeutic benefit of the intensive treatment relative to the standard
           treatment in the proportion of hematoma expansion (defined as increase from baseline
           hematoma volume of &gt; 33%) and in the change from baseline peri-hematoma volume at 24
           hours on the serial computed tomographic (CT) scans.

        4. Assess the safety of the intensive treatment relative to the standard treatment in the
           proportion of subjects with treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) within 72
           hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The report from a National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Workshop on
      priorities for clinical research in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in December 2003
      recommended clinical trials for evaluation of blood pressure (BP) management in acute ICH as
      a leading priority. The Special Writing Group of the Stroke Council of the American Heart
      Association in 1999 and 2007 emphasized the need for clinical trials to ensure
      evidence-based treatment of acute hypertension in ICH. Consequently, we propose to conduct a
      five-year international, multicenter, open-labeled, randomized, controlled, Phase III trial
      to determine the efficacy of early, intensive antihypertensive treatment using intravenous
      nicardipine for acute hypertension in subjects with co-morbid hypertension and spontaneous
      supratentorial ICH. The primary hypothesis of this large, streamlined, focused trial is that
      the group treated with intensive BP reduction (systolic BP [SBP] of 140 mmHg or less -
      hereafter referred to as the intensive treatment) using intravenous nicardipine infusion for
      24 hours reduces the proportion of death and disability at 3 months by 10% or greater
      compared with the group treated with the standard BP reduction (SBP of 180 mmHg or less -
      hereafter referred to as the standard treatment) among patients with ICH treated within 4.5
      hours of symptom onset. The underlying mechanism for this expected beneficial effect of
      intensive treatment is mediated through reduction of the rate and magnitude of hematoma
      expansion observed in approximately 38% of patients with acute ICH. The trial will recruit a
      maximum of 1,280 subjects with ICH who meet the eligibility criteria. The primary outcome is
      the proportion of death and disability at 3 months defined by modified Rankin scale (mRS)
      score of 4 to 6. The proposed clinical trial is the natural extension of numerous case
      series, a subsequent pilot trial funded by the National Institutes of Health National
      Institute of Health (NIH), and a preliminary randomized controlled trial in this patient
      group funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, that have
      recently confirmed the safety and tolerability of both the regimen and goals of the
      antihypertensive treatment in acutely hypertensive patients with ICH proposed in the present
      trial. The proposed trial will have important public health implications by providing
      necessary information regarding the efficacy and safety of antihypertensive treatment of
      acute hypertension observed in up to 75% of the subjects with ICH. BP treatment represents a
      strategy that can be made widely available without the need of specialized equipment and
      personnel and therefore can make a major impact upon outcome in patients with ICH.
      Substantial reduction in morbidity and mortality appears possible if the estimates of
      treatment effect sizes from our current pilot trials are accurate.

    <description>Primary outcome is death or disability, defined by modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 4-6 at 3 m following treatment. We chose the mRS because of its high inter-observer reliability, superiority to other indices (e.g., Barthel index), and consistency with previous trials in patients with ICH. Further reliability will be increased by training raters in using the structured interview and obtaining a mRS grade. A dichotomous outcome was chosen to reduce the rate of mis-classification and increase the sensitivity of detecting meaningful difference.</description>
