    <textblock>
      This study will look at the rate of infections developed by subjects comparing the use of
      disposable draping systems versus reusable draping systems in the operating room.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects enrolled in the study will be randomized into two groups. One group will have the
      reusable draping system during surgery which the investigators currently use and the second
      group will have the disposable draping system. Subjects will be blinded to the type of
      draping system used. Subjects are under anesthesia at the time the surgical drapes are
      placed. After the subject has signed the informed consent, they will be assigned a study
      number for that surgery. The study number will correlate to an envelope which will contain
      information on the type of draping system to be used. Subjects enrolled, may be randomized
      more than once. Subjects will typically have a minimum of two surgeries, the placement of
      the tissue expanders and then the removal of the expanders and placement of the breast
      implants. Subjects will not be required to sign another consent form but will be randomized
      prior to each surgery. Surgeons who have subjects in the disposable draping system will use
      a disposable draping kit that includes gowns for the surgeons and also towels. For subjects
      who are having a mastectomy and then the placement of tissue expanders, after the mastectomy
      has been performed, the plastic surgeons will use all new draping, towels and gowns to
      perform tissue expander placement. A swab will be taken on the wound site to determine if
      there are any CFUs (colony forming units) present. The swab will then be placed in a tube
      containing 1ml of TSB (triptic soy broth). The tube will then be sonicated , and then
      vortexed for 15 seconds. A 0.1ml aliquot of the solution will be placed in a blood agar
      plate and incubated for 48 hours to determine the CFU count. The remainder of the solution
      will be frozen. In the event an infection occurs, molecular matching will be done on the
      culture to determine if it is from the same exact culture. Rodac plates will be used to test
      for the presence of bacterial cultures on the surgeon's gown (Forearm [volar surface]) and
      glove (palm of surgeon's dominate hand) and also the subject's surgical drape (Area over
      sternum). These will be incubated for 48 hours to determine the CFU count. This process will
      be repeated at the second surgery.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Females ages 18 years of age and older who are having a mastectomy with tissue expander
        placement and for breast implants for reconstruction, which would include immediate or
        delayed reconstruction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Male subjects are excluded from this study, while some males do have breast cancer, this
        is a rare occurrence and they do not undergo reconstruction surgery with expanders and
        breast implants. Females under the age of 18 are excluded as well as females who undergo a
        mastectomy but do not have any reconstruction surgery. Females who otherwise meet the
        criteria but have an active infection, currently on antibiotics to treat an infection,
        urinary tract infections, soft tissue infections or pneumonia are also excluded until they
        are approved for surgery by the physician.
