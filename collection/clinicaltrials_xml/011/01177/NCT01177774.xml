  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study why most children who have tics never develop
      Tourette syndrome but some do. In other words, we aim to find features that may predict
      whose tics will go away and whose tics will continue or worsen, in children ages 5 through
      17 years whose first tic occurred within the past 6 months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30% of all children will have a tic at some point. However, tics that last a whole
      year (or more) occur in only 3% of the population. Thus tic persistence may be more unusual
      than tic onset, yet almost no data exist on which people with recent-onset tics go on to be
      diagnosable with Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder, versus those whose tics are only
      transient.

      The overall goal of this research is to identify, prospectively, what imaging, clinical or
      neuropsychological features of children who just recently started ticcing will go on to
      develop a chronic tic disorder (including Tourette syndrome). Hypotheses are derived
      primarily from studies of patients with established tic disorders.

      Aim 1: Apply functional connectivity analysis, fMRI, structural MRI, clinical, and
      neuropsychological methods in the first-ever pathophysiological study of the &quot;pre-Tourette&quot;
      population. The goal is to address whether markers previously associated with chronic TS
      will predict in advance which children with recent-onset tics will progress to Tourette
      syndrome.

      Aim 2: Generate preliminary data for an adequately powered future study.

      Follow-up at 3 and 12 months will enable a preliminary comparison of children whose tics
      remit compared to those whose do not. Clinical and neuropsychological variables may predict
      poor long-term outcomes in children with tics. Additionally we will collect DNA samples from
      all subjects for future genetic analysis once we have a large enough sample; prior studies
      have examined subjects with an established tic disorder, i.e. both tic onset and tic
      persistence, whereas we will have an opportunity in this data set to examine genetic
      predictors specifically of tic persistence vs. disappearance.

    <description>Research diagnosis of a chronic tic disorder at 12 months (cases), versus those whose tics are absent at 12 months (controls), will define two groups who will be compared on their baseline status (almost a year earlier) on a quantitative measure of functional connectivity maturity, pre-tic BOLD signal, caudate nucleus volume, and several clinical and neuropsychological measures.</description>

        A convenience sample of 36 children age 5-17 who have tics now but whose first-ever tic
        occurred within the past 6 months. Subjects will be a convenience sample from community

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We will study a convenience sample of 36 children age 5-17 who have tics now, but
             developed them only in the past 6 months; and

          -  Informed consent from a parent and assent from the child.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary tics,

          -  Known structural brain disease,

          -  Other movement disorders including essential tremor,

          -  Neurological disorders other than migraine, including cerebral palsy and epilepsy

          -  Moderate to severe mental retardation,

          -  Autism,

          -  Current major depression,

          -  Moderate to severe current systemic illness,

          -  Antipsychotics or tetrabenazine taken for &gt;1 week ever or within the past month,

          -  Current use of certain medications,

          -  Lack of proficiency in the English language that will affect the informed consent
             process or the psychological testing.

          -  Additionally, children will be excluded from MRI if they have contraindications to
             MRI, a positive pregnancy test (females after menarche), or current use of certain
             medications.
