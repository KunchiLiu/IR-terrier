    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand why and how oxidative stress negatively impacts
      mobility in the elderly, and to determine whether antioxidant supplements can increase
      vascular health and mobility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the premise that U.S. Veteran demographics reveal an aging population with significant
      mobility limitation and oxidative stress is tightly linked to both of these characteristics,
      a series of skeletal muscle/vascular studies are proposed. Specifically, in a series of
      recent studies the investigators' group has documented positive vascular consequences of
      antioxidant supplementation during exercise in older subjects that negatively impacted young
      people. Further provocative findings revealed that following exercise training the older
      subjects were now also negatively impacted by the antioxidant supplementation. These
      findings have implications for the understanding of the complex balance between the positive
      effects of exercise-based rehabilitation, exercise induced oxidative stress, aging, frailty,
      and subsequent mobility limitation. Therefore four specific aims are proposed that will
      answer the questions of where (I) oxidative stress is most prevalent in the elderly, why
      (II) oxidative stress occurs in the elderly, what (III) are the acute consequences of
      oxidative stress in the elderly, and finally how (IV) can exercise-induced oxidative stress
      as the result of exercise training in elderly be appropriately managed with exogenous
      antioxidant therapy to promote compliance and the positive outcome of increased mobility.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy men and women aged either between 18 - 30 years (young group) and &gt;70 years
             (old group)

          -  Free of overt disease. Subjects will be non-obese (BMI &lt; 30) and have plasma glucose
             concentrations &lt; 7.0 mmol/L under fasting conditions and &lt; 11.1 mmol/L at 120 minutes
             of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)

          -  Subjects will be sedentary, defined here as no regular physical activity for at least
             the prior 2 years

          -  Candidates must have no orthopedic limitations that would prohibit them from
             performing cycle or knee-extensor exercise

          -  All women will be postmenopausal (either natural or surgical) defined as a cessation
             of menses for at least 2 years, and in women without a uterus, follicle stimulating
             hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 IU/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Candidates demonstrating dyslipidemia based on the National Cholesterol Education
             Program Guidelines of plasma total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dl with LDL-cholesterol &gt; 160
             mg/dl will be excluded from participation

          -  Candidates who smoke or are taking medications (blood pressure medications, statins,
             antioxidants etc.) that could influence the results of the study will not be eligible

          -  In terms of diet, subjects will be asked to maintain a dietary record for one week
             prior to the pre-screening and if this reveals a diet that differs substantially from
             the &quot;typical&quot; average diet in both the young and old, the subject will not be
             eligible

          -  Women currently taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the preceding year will
             be excluded from the proposed studies
