    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, 3-arm, dose-blinded, parallel-group study. Subjects will be randomized
      to one of 3 treatment titration regimes (slow titration over 6 weeks, fast titration over 3
      weeks, and no titration).

    <description>Group 1 subjects will receive weekly Avonex 30 mcg (full dose) IM injections from Week 1 to Week 8. Group 2 subjects will titrate in quarter dose increments every week up to a full dose of Avonex over a 3 week period from Week 1 to Week 3 and then continue on full dose from Week 4 to Week 8. Group 3 subjects will titrate in quarter dose increments every 2 weeks up to a full dose of Avonex over a 6 week period from Week 1 to Week 6 and continue on full dose from Week 7 to Week 8</description>
