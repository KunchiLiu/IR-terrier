    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if GSK1292263 is safe and well-tolerated when
      administered to type 2 diabetics, and to get preliminary information about whether it may be
      effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

      Data from this study will be used to assess the potential of GSK1292263 as a treatment for
      T2DM, and will aid the design and dose selection of future studies of longer duration in
      T2DM subjects that will evaluate GSK1292263 alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic
      drugs.
