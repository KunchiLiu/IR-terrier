  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is a prevalent condition that markedly impacts quality of life and
      disproportionately affects women. Overactive Bladder syndrome (OAB) is defined as symptoms
      of urgency and frequency with urge urinary incontinence (OAB-wet) and without urge
      incontinence (OAB-dry). Conservative first line treatments for urge incontinence combined
      with other OAB symptoms (OAB-wet) include behavioral therapy, pelvic floor training +/-
      biofeedback, or the use of anticholinergic medications. These treatment modalities may not
      result in total continence and often drug therapy is discontinued because of lack of
      efficacy, side effects and cost or because of not wanting to take a pill. Behavioral therapy
      and pelvic muscle exercises require consistent, active intervention by the patient which is
      often not sustained. Thus, the objective of the Anticholinergic vs Botox Comparison Study
      (ABC) is to determine whether a single intra-detrusor injection of botulinum toxin A (Botox
      A®) is more effective than a standardized regimen of oral anticholinergics in reducing urge
      urinary incontinence. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the change from
      baseline in average number of urge urinary incontinence episodes over 6 months between
      groups.

      This study is a 6-month double-blind randomized trial comparing intra-detrusor botulinum
      toxin A (Botox A®) and anticholinergic therapy in women without neurologic disease with urge
      incontinence. Subjects will be followed up to an additional six months off study drug to
      determine duration of treatment effect.

      The primary aim is to compare the change in urge incontinence episodes over 6 months between
      women receiving a single intra-detrusor injection of 100 unit of botulinum toxin A (Botox
      A®) plus daily oral placebo tablets versus women receiving a single intra-detrusor injection
      of saline plus daily anticholinergic therapy.

    <description>A standardized 3-step anticholinergic regimen of daily oral solifenacin 5mg, solifenacin 10mg, and/or trospium XR 60mg, as well as a single intradetrusor injection of saline (placebo). All subjects will begin on solifenacin 5 mg for 2 mo. Dose escalation or drug change will be based exclusively on the result of the Patient Global Symptom Control Rating. If a subject's symptoms are not adequately controlled at 2 mo, she will be escalated to solifenacin 10mg, and similarly at 4 mo to trospium XR 60mg. If a subject's symptoms are adequately controlled on solifenacin 5 mg, she may continue that study medication for the entirety of the study (6 mo). Additionally, if a subject is dose-escalated to solifenacin 10mg at study mo 2 or 4, and her symptoms are adequately controlled, she may continue the solifenacin 10mg dose for the remainder of the study.</description>

    <description>A single intradetrusor injection of 100U botulinum toxin A in 10 mL plus 0.1 mL of indigo carmine administered during cytoscopy. Between 100 and 200ml of saline is instilled into the bladder prior to injection to allow adequate visualization of the entire bladder urothelium. The treating physician will inject a total of 10.1 mL of the masked substance into approximately 15 to 20 different detrusor muscle sites under direct visualization using disposable needles. Injections will be spread out to equally cover the posterior bladder wall and dome, but spare the bladder trigone and ureteral orifices.</description>
