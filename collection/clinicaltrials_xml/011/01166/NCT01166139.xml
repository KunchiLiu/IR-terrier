      A phase IIa open-label single center pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      Nilotinib in patients with Scleroderma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how safe and tolerable a medication called Nilotinib
      (Tasigna) will be for patients diagnosed with Systemic Sclerosis. Systemic Sclerosis
      (scleroderma) is an autoimmune disease that can involve the skin, the blood vessels, the
      muscles and other connective tissues, and major organs including the lungs, kidneys,
      gastrointestinal tract, and heart. The exact cause of this disorder is not known at this
      time and no drug has been proven to cure scleroderma. Experiments done in animal models and
      &quot;test-tube&quot; models of fibrosis suggest that Nilotinib may be a useful therapy for
      scleroderma. Nilotinib is a medication on the market which has been FDA approved for the
      treatment of a type of leukemia called chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It is an oral
      medication, taken two times a day.

      This is a 32 week, open-label, Phase IIa, single center clinical trial. The primary goal of
      the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of Nilotinib in patients with
      scleroderma. The secondary goal is to assess how effective Nilotinib is in treating patients
      with scleroderma. The clinical tests performed such as the Modified Rodnan Skin Score,
      Pulmonary Function Tests, Echocardiograms, Electrocardiograms, and the blood and skin
      collected in this study will help determine whether this therapy is safe and effective, and
      also improve our understanding of scleroderma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than or equal to eighteen years.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of diffuse systemic sclerosis by ACR criteria, with a stable
             modified Rodnan skin score in the one month preceding introduction of oral nilotinib
             therapy. The modified Rodnan skin score must be greater than or equal to sixteen at
             screening and initiation of therapy.

          3. Disease duration of less than or equal to 3 years as defined by the date of onset of
             the first non-Raynaud's symptom.

          4. Estimated ejection fraction of greater than 50% by echocardiography

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to render informed consent in accordance with institutional guidelines.

          2. Disease duration of greater than 3 years.

          3. Patients with mixed connective tissue disease or &quot;overlap&quot; (i.e. those who satisfy
             more than one set of ACR criteria for a rheumatic disease.)

          4. Limited scleroderma.

          5. Systemic sclerosis-like illness associated with environmental or ingested agents such
             as toxic rapeseed oil, vinyl chloride, or bleomycin.

          6. Ongoing treatment with immunosuppressive therapies including cyclophosphamide,
             azathioprine, mycophenolic acid, methotrexate, or cyclosporine, or use of those
             medications within 1 month of trial entry.

          7. The use of other anti-fibrotic agents including colchicine, D-penicillamine,
             minocycline, or Type 1 oral Collagen in the month prior to enrollment.

          8. Use in the prior month of corticosteroids at doses exceeding the equivalent of
             prednisone 10 mg daily. Use of corticosteroid at &lt; 10 mg of prednisone can continue
             during the course of the study.

          9. Concurrent serious medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator makes
             the patient inappropriate for this study such as uncontrollable CHF, arrhythmia,
             severe pulmonary or systemic hypertension, severe GI involvement, hepatic impairment,
             serum creatinine of greater than 2.0, active infection, severe diabetes, unstable
             atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, malignancy, HIV, or severe peripheral
             vascular disease.

             sotalol) or that prolong the QTc interval (including, but not limited to chloroquine,
             halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, bepridil and
             pimozide) will be excluded.

         13. Patients requiring the ongoing use of medications that are potent inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4.

         14. A positive pregnancy test at entry into this study. Men and women with reproductive
             potential will be required to use effective means of contraception through the course
