  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that Tacrolimus (Tac) withdrawal from a Tac, MMF and steroid
      based triple therapy regimen leads to long term improved/stabilized graft function
      (glomerular filtration rate, GFR) primarily as a consequence of halting CNI-induced
      fibrogenetic processes that mediate loss of functioning renal tissue. The investigators
      further hypothesize that the underlying fibrotic mechanism is mediated by pathophysiologic
      processes that promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (mediated by TGF- ƒÒ) and
      that early therapeutic intervention may reverse this process (mediated by BMP-7)4.

      To address these hypotheses the investigators propose the following clinical and mechanistic
      aims:

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that switching from Tac to SRL in a Tac based
      triple therapy regimen with MMF and steroids in living and or deceased donor renal
      transplant recipients leads to improvement in allograft structure and function at 2 years
      post-transplantation.

      The investigators will test this hypothesis in an open label controlled trial where stable
      renal allograft recipients on Tac, MMF, prednisone maintenance immunosuppression will
      undergo renal biopsy at 3-4 months post-transplantation and will be randomized to either a)
      Remain on Tac, MMF and prednisone (CNI-maintenance) or b) switch the Tac to SRL and continue
      MMF and prednisone. The investigators will then compare biopsy derived measures of allograft
      fibrosis (CADI, Sirius Red, Banff Chronicity Index) and GFR in the two groups
