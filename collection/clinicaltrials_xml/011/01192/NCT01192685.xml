  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has demonstrated efficacy as a treatment for major
      depression. No objective markers have been identified that indicate which patients are most
      likely to respond to TMS therapy. The goal of the present investigation is to determine
      whether an electroencephalographic measure called cordance or a measure of blood flow in the
      frontal brain, as measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can serve as predictors of
      outcome with TMS therapy in depression. Subjects with depression will be treated in this
      study for 6 weeks with TMS. Frontal brain blood flow measured using NIRS will be assessed
      prior to TMS therapy, and repeatedly thereafter. EEG cordance will also be obtained
      following a similar schedule. Measures of depression and other psychiatric disorders will be
      collected prior to, during and for 2 weeks after the completion of TMS treatment. The
      correlation between these measures and the EEG and NIRS measures will then be determined to
      see if these latter measures are predictive of improvement in depression.

    <description>The primary outcome will be the correlations between EEG cordance or task-induced changes in frontal total Hb levels and changes in MADRAS scores between baseline and the last treatment day. Correlations between these measures will be determined between other cordance and total Hb levels obtained after the first week of treatment and MADRAS changes for the last day of treatment. Similar analyses will be conducted for changes in MADRAS scores between baseline and the follow-up visit.</description>

        Inclusion criteria List

          1. Depressive disorder Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth
             Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).

          2. MADRAS score of 26 or above and history of depression, as defined by meeting DSM-IV
             criteria for major depression, dysthymic disorder, or substance-induced mood
             disorder.

          3. Male or female aged 18 to 65.

          4. Females who are not pregnant or nursing.

          5. Individuals able to provide informed written consent and are able to comply with
             study procedures.

          6. Subjects who have received or are receiving anti-depressant medication.

          7. Patients who are depressed as assessed by the above criteria and have not had optimum
             response to their antidepressant medication in their current episode.

        Exclusion criteria List

          1. Any Axis I diagnosis that, in the opinion of the investigators, may interfere with
             the course of the trial.

          2. Any current diagnoses of alcohol abuse or dependence.

          3. Any current substance use disorder.

          4. Medical or neurological illness that in the investigators judgment would make study
             compliance difficult or would be a contraindication for use with TMS.

          5. Currently receiving any medication that markedly increases the risks for seizures,
             for example: tricyclic antidepressants, INH, meperidine, lidocaine, and clozapine.

          6. Subjects who have implanted metallic devices or non-removable metallic objects in or
             around the head that can be magnetized, however metal fillings, braces, and dental
             implants are acceptable.

          7. Subjects who have implanted devices that emit physiological signals including
             cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), and vagus nerve stimulators.

          8. Subjects who have received any investigational drug during the prior 30 days.

          9. Clinically significant abnormal lab values as assesses by the Investigator.

         10. Risk for suicidal behavior based on clinician assessment and a score of greater than
             5 on the suicidal thought item of the MADRS or a score of 4 on the suicide item of
             the Hamilton Depression rating scale.

         11. Subjects who have had a serious suicide attempt in the past year as assessed by the
             Investigator.

         12. Current other somatic antidepressant therapy, i.e. vagus nerve stimulation,
             electroconvulsive therapy, or phototherapy.

         13. Started psychotherapy in the past 30 days.
