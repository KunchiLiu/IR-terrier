    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study that will collect outcome data for patients who
      choose to undergo transoral tongue base operations for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea
      Syndrome (OSAHS)as part of their standard of care treatment. This is a data collection study
      only and does not provide for evaluations or treatment of OSAHS.
