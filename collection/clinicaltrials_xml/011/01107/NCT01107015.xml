    <textblock>
      The Mobile Diabetes Intervention Study trial is evaluating a diabetes coaching system, using
      mobile phones and patient/ physician internet portals to allow patient-specific treatment
      and communication by their primary care physician. We hypothesize that timely information
      provided to patients and their physicians can result in reduction of A1c over 1 year.

    <description>Patients select one of two mobile phone models, receive a one-year unlimited mobile phone data and phone service plan, receive the study treatment phone software and have access to the web-based individual patient portal. Given system-driven guidance on when to test blood glucose (bg) based on disease status, medication regimen, and time of poorest control. Patients enter bg data, carbohydrates consumed, diabetes medications taken and miscellaneous comments regarding diabetes self-care. Messages are sent to the patient's mobile phone giving feedback on entered data. Entered data are captured in real-time in the web-based logbook. Patients may provide their PCPs with printed copies of their logbooks and other information but physicians do not have access to the patient portal system. Patient action plans summarizing the patient-entered data and identifying possible self-management actions for improving their diabetes control are electronically sent to the patients every 2.5 months.</description>

Patients enter bg data, carbohydrates consumed, diabetes medications taken and miscellaneous comments regarding diabetes self-care. Messages are sent to the patient's mobile phone giving feedback on entered data. Entered data are captured in real-time in the web-based logbook. PCPs are provided access to a secure web portal where they can see their patients' electronic logbooks. PCPs are provided with data analysis reports. The PCP is reminded that all data analysis is based on patient-entered, unvalidated data. The PCP has the option to use this information and remains responsible for all treatment decisions.</description>
