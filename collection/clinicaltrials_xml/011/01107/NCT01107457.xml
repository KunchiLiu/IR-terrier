      The primary purpose for this study is to help answer the following research questions

        -  The safety of ixekizumab (LY2439821) and any side effects that might be associated with
           it.

        -  Whether ixekizumab can help participants with Psoriasis.

        -  How much ixekizumab should be given to participants.

      The study is a Phase 2 study with 2 parts. Part A is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging design and Part B is an optional, open
      label extension design. Approximately 125 participants will be randomized to 1 of 4
      ixekizumab groups or to placebo (approximately 25 participants per group) in Part A.
      Participants will be evaluated for treatment efficacy and the primary endpoint will be
      evaluated at week 12. Between week 20 and week 32, participants with a less than 75%
      improvement in their Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score compared to baseline
      will be eligible to begin Part B. Participants in Part B will receive subcutaneous (SC)
      injections of ixekizumab 120 milligrams (mg) every 4 weeks through week 236. Subsequent to
      an amendment on May 2012, administration changed to 80 mg every 4 weeks through Week 236.
      Participants who complete both Part A and B have a total study participation of up to
      approximately 240 to 264 weeks.
