    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the incidence and severity of respiratory depression in
      elective cesarean section patients who have received a spinal or epidural narcotic called
      duramorph for management of postoperative pain. A monitoring device called a capnograph as
      well as a device called a pulse oximeter is placed on the patient once in the recovery room
      after delivery. The capnograph monitors the carbon dioxide level that the patient breathes
      out as well as their respiratory rate. The pulse oximeter is a device that is taped on the
      patient's finger and measures their oxygen saturation level. The monitoring is maintained
      for 18-24 hours after surgery.
