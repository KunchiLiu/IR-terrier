      Use of a new ultrasound device designed for babies to look at the catheters in veins and
      arteries as well as the blood vessel itself. An observational study to assess the the
      clinicians perception of the ultrasound image quality as a tool to detect catheters in
      vessels.

      The intent of the study is to confirm the maximum penetration of the NICU-Tech RM9L-RS
      probe. The investigators will endeavor to collect images on patients with PIV (Peripheral
      Intra Venous)/PAC (Peripheral Arterial Catheter) and central line catheters. The
      investigators will also endeavor to collect images of deep vessel structures for offline
      processing to improve NICU-Tech algorithms for vessel segmentation.
