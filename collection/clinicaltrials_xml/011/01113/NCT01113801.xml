      The purpose of this study is to determine if LY2382770 is safe and effective at protecting
      kidney function in participants with kidney disease due to diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine if LY2382770, administered monthly for 1 year, is more
      effective than placebo at slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease in participants
      treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin II receptor
      blocker (ARB).
