  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the weight loss effect and safety of 400 mg velneperit and 120 mg orlistat
      administered individually or combined three times per day for 24 weeks while on a reduced
      calorie diet (RCD) and also to evaluate the steady-state trough concentrations of velneperit
      (S-2367), velneperit (S-2367) tert-butyl OH, and velneperit (S-2367) tert-butyl OH-O
      glucuronide following 400 mg of velneperit (S-2367) three times per day and 120 mg of
      orlistat, either combined or separate.
