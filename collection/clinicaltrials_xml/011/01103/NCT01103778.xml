    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the ability of Velcade® (bortezomib)
      to induce complete or partial remission in patients with severe IgA nephropathy.

      The secondary objectives are to assess clinical outcomes relating to safety and efficacy,
      such as infection, malignancy, preservation of renal function, partial responders, relapse
      rate, and to study mechanistic assays to predict remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory single center, open-label, single treatment group assignment, safety and
      efficacy study will enroll 15 patients with severe IgA nephropathy. Subjects will receive 1
      cycle of Velcade® to induce clinical remission. Follow-up visits will occur monthly for a
      year.

      For this pilot study, the proportion of patients with clinical remission or partial response
      will be analyzed.

      Monetary compensation will be provided to study participants.
