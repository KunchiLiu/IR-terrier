  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II
      dose of docetaxel-PNP (polymeric nanoparticle formulation of docetaxel) and to evaluate the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of docetaxel-PNP in subjects with advanced solid malignancies.

          -  Patient ages more than 18 years old

          -  Patient should voluntarily sign a written informed consent before study entry

          -  Patient historically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor and
             patient with measurable disease or evaluable disease by RECIST criteria

          -  Progressive disease with development of new lesions or an increase in preexisting
             lesions or standard therapy in order to provide clinical benefit does not exist or is
             no longer effective

          -  Previous anti-cancer therapies must be completed before 21days of first study dose
             and Patient must have recovered from any previous therapy

          -  Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-1

          -  Patient has a life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Baseline studies for determining eligibility must be completed within 14 days of
             first study dose and patient has a adequate organ function including the following:

               -  Hb ≥ 10g/dl

               -  ANC ≥ 1.5 X 109/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 X 109/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has had a major surgery except tumor ablation within 2 weeks before screening
             visit

          -  Patient has a brain metastasis with neurologic symptom

          -  Patient has a sensory neuropathy or motor neuropathy ≥ grade 2 by NCI-CTCAE

          -  Patient has any serious concurrent disease such as:

        Any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
        prohibit the understanding and giving of informed consent Severe cardiovascular disease

        six months, grade 3-4 congestive heart failure defined by the New York Heart Association
        criteria) Active un controlled infection.

             trial (screening, treatment period, and 3 weeks from the last done). A negative
             pregnancy test (urine or serum) should be documented within 14 days prior to
             initiation of trial medication for women of childbearing potential who have not been
