  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the effect of a newly-approved stimulant medication,
      lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), on specific residual symptoms of depression found in some
      patients who are undergoing treatment with, but have only partially responded to, a
      selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or selective-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
      (SNRI) antidepressant. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that symptoms potentially
      related to deficient dopaminergic activity, such as lassitude, apathy, reduced positive
      affect and impaired executive function, in particular, will improve. This protocol is
      designed to test the hypothesis that this cluster of co-occurring residual symptoms
      sometimes found in treated depression will respond as a group to psychostimulant therapy.
      The investigators propose to measure this cluster of symptoms in a population of residually
      depressed subjects demonstrating them, and then to measure the effect of stimulant therapy
      on this cluster, and each constituent symptom, as well as to measure its effect on subjects'
      overall functional impairment, and to document treatment emergent adverse effects. The
      investigators hope to better understand the specific symptoms in this clinical population
      that are likely to improve with stimulant therapy. The investigators also hope to be able to
      characterize the side effect burden of stimulant therapy in this clinical population.

    <description>Subjects given 30 mg study drug (Vyvanse vs. matched placebo) at baseline to take each morning. If 30 mg intolerable before next scheduled appointment, they can return to clinic and exchange 30 mg tablets for 20 mg tablets. Visit 3 dosage range is 20-40 mg/d. Now subjects have been taking either 30 or 20 mg of study medication per day. If clinical effects insufficient and side effects tolerable, subject's dose will be raised by 10 mg/d to 30 or 40 mg/d. If subjects receiving more than 20 mg/d experience uncomfortable side effects, their dose may be reduced to 20 mg at that visit. Visit 4 dosage range is 20-50 mg, study drug dose may be moved up or down by 10 mg based on clinical judgment, minimum of 20 mg, maximum of 50 mg/d. Study drug dosage must not change over the last 2 weeks (end of 4 weeks on study drug).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression during the present episode of
             illness, currently with at least mild improvement by report (CGI-I ≥3) but with
             continuing residual symptoms.

          2. A score of ≥10 on MADRS items 1,2,6,7 and 8, (the MADRS Dysphoric Apathy/Retardation
             factor, Parker et al., 2003) at screening and randomization. These 5 items are:
             Apparent sadness, Reported sadness, Concentration difficulties, Lassitude, and
             Inability to feel. A score of ≥3 will be required for at least 2 of these items.

          3. A score of 3 or 4 on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) at screening
             and randomization.

          4. At randomization subjects must have received therapeutic dosages of approved SSRI or
             SNRI agents for at least 8 weeks, with the last 4 weeks at a constant dosage.

          5. Females of Child-bearing Potential (FOCP) must have a negative serum beta Human
