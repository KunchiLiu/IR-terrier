      The purpose of this research is to investigate school response to families who have children
      with cancer. It is anticipated that the results of this study will enhance the support that
      schools can give to the population of families who have a child with cancer. The study will
      involve the parents in these families, the principal and an educator in the school of the
      child with cancer. Measurement tools will include surveys, interviews, and other relevant
      educational and medical documents.
