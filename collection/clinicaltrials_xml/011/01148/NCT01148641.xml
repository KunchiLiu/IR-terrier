      This study aims to assess the acceptability of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) for
      use as nutritional supplements for infants and young children in Guatemala.

      The study will be conducted in three phases. Phase 1 will be a test-feeding to compare the
      acceptability of two different flavors of LNS (peanut and cinnamon) in infants and young
      children and their mothers or caregivers in terms of taste, smell and texture, as well as
      amount of the test-dose consumed. In Phase 2, children in the Phase 1 trial will receive a
      2-week supply of one of the LNS products, which they will consume daily in their homes for
      14 days under real-life conditions. Direct observation of supplement use and in-depth
      interviews with mothers, caregivers and health staff providing services in communities will
      be part of this phase too. In Phase 3, focus group discussions will be held with
      participants (mothers and caregivers) as well as with health staff providing services in
      communities to discuss different aspects of infant and child feeding and best ways for the
      LNS product to be used in the context of Guatemala.

      We hypothesize that both flavors of LNS will be accepted by Guatemalan infants and young
      children children and their mothers or caregivers.
