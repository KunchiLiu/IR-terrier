    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see whether a tele-health intervention can improve
      health, functioning status, emotional status, quality of life, and patient satisfaction for
      patients with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and to examine the cost benefits of this
      intervention.
