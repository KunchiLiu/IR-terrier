    <textblock>
      The aim of this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of supplementary treatment with cholecalciferol (vitamin
      D3) in subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis (R MS) treated with subcutaneous (s.c.)
      interferon beta-1a 44 µg (Rebif) 3 times weekly. The subjects will be divided into 2 groups,
      one receiving cholecalciferol 100,000 IU twice monthly along with Rebif treatment and the
      other group will be on placebo along with Rebif treatment. A total of 200 subjects will be
      recruited in 20-30 centres in France.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of RRMS according to Poser criteria (clinically definite multiple sclerosis
             [CDMS] or laboratory supported definite multiple sclerosis [LSDMS]) or according to

          -  Subjects aged between 18 and 65 years.

          -  Treated with interferon beta-1a 44 µg (or 22 µg in case of intolerance to 44 µg) 3
             times weekly subcutaneously for 4 months ± (2 months) at the randomization visit
             (V1).

          -  Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5.
