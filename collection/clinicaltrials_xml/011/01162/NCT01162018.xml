  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will recruit 60 women with breast cancer who finished undergoing
      treatment who complain of persistent insomnia problems that began with onset of their cancer
      diagnosis. The eligible women would be randomized and stratified by sleep problems to two
      arms: (Acupuncture Arm vs. Sham Acupuncture) with a goal of having 48 patients complete the
      study (we anticipate about 20% attrition rate). The study interventions will begin after
      patients completed their treatment. The placebo control for acupuncture will be a validated
      sham acupuncture control Assessments will be made with daily diaries and with weekly
      questionnaires. PSG data will be collected on the subsample of the population. Data will be
      gathered via pencil-and-paper measures before, during, immediately following, one month
      following the completion of treatment and six months after the conclusion of treatment. In
      addition, actigraphy data (objective sleep continuity data) will be acquired prior to and
      following treatment
