      This study will gather information about the combination the drugs plerixafor with
      sargramostim in donors of blood-forming cells (stem cells). These stem cells will be
      collected from the donor and transplanted into their sibling. The investigators believe that
      the two drugs together will provide enough stem cells for transplantation and may also
      reduce the risk of graft versus host disease.

    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to gather information about the combination the drugs
      plerixafor with sargramostim in donors of blood-forming cells (stem cells). Stem cells can
      be taken from the bone marrow of the pelvic bones or from the blood following treatment with
      drugs called growth factors; sargramostim is such a drug. Once stem cells leave the bone
      marrow and circulate in the blood, they are called peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs).
      These cells can be collected through a routine procedure called apheresis, which involves
      placing two IVs into the arm which are connected to an apheresis machine; the machine then
      takes blood from the body, removes the stem cells, and returns the blood to the body.

      Normally, a growth factor called filgrastim is given to donors in order to collect the stem
      cells used for transplantation. However, when stem cells collected using filgrastim are
      transplanted in patients, a possible unpredictable complication is graft versus host
      disease. It's thought that using a different growth factor such as sargramostim might reduce
      the occurrences of graft versus host disease in patients. However, sargramostim alone does
      not provide as many stem cells for transplantation as other growth factors. Plerixafor is
      another drug that can increase the number of PBSCs in a donor, but like with sargramostim,
      plerixafor alone does not always provide enough stem cells. This is why sargramostim and
      plerixafor are being combined in this study: the investigators believe that the two drugs
      together will provide enough stem cells for transplantation and may also reduce the risk of
      graft versus host disease.

    <description>The primary endpoint is to reduce the number of donors treated with GM-CSF who require a second collection to obtain a minimum CD34/Kg (2 x 106) necessary for allogeneic stem cell transplantation when compared to historic controls mobilized with GM-CSF or plerixafor alone. A reduction in failed first leukapheresis from 40% to less than 10% as seen with G-CSF alone would be considered clinically meaningful.</description>
