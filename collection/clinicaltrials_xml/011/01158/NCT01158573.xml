  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether there are higher levels of cysteinyl
      leukotrienes in obese subjects than in non-obese subjects. Cysteinyl leukotrienes are
      pro-inflammatory substances that cause asthma by narrowing the airways of the lung. The
      investigators want to see if subjects with increased fat stores and therefore increased
      leptin, which is a fat-related protein that regulates leukotrienes, have increased levels of
      leukotrienes in the blood, lung and urine. The investigators would also like to determine
      the relationship between cysteinyl leukotrienes and exhaled nitric oxide levels in
      asthmatics with and without obesity. Nitric oxide is anti-inflammatory and suppresses
      leukotriene synthesis.

      This is a cross-sectional observational study to characterize the association between obese
      asthmatics and the inflammatory mediators cysteinyl leukotrienes. Our hypothesis is that
      altered adipokine levels in obesity result in augmented cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis that
      play a significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma in these subjects.
