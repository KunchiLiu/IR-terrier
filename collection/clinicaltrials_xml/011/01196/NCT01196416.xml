      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of gamma-secretase/Notch
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 when given together with cisplatin, vinblastine, and
      temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic
      melanoma. Gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, vinblastine, and temozolomide, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 together with
      combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of daily RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) administered orally daily in combination with CVT
      (starting dose: cisplatin 25 mg/m^2 intravenous [IV] daily x 3; vinblastine 1.2 mg/m^2 IV
      daily x 3, and temozolomide [TMZ] 150 mg/m^2 orally [PO] daily x 5) administered on an every
      21 day schedule. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of RO4929097
      with CVT in patients with metastatic melanoma with correlative biomarkers for Notch pathway
      signaling and gamma secretase enzyme activity. (Phase Ib) III. Based on the MTD from the
      phase Ib study, to conduct a phase II trial and to determine the response rate and overall
      survival. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the combination of RO4929097 and
      temozolomide. (Phase Ib) II. To obtain tissue biopsy for correlative studies before the
      initiation of therapy and one week after treatment with RO4929097 and CVT. (Phase Ib and II)
      III. To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated at the phase II dose.
      (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is phase I dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097,
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO once daily
      (QD) on days 1-21, cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and vinblastine IV over 30 minutes on days
      1-3, and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without progressive
      disease continue to receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 and
      temozolomide as above in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 24 months.

             barrier contraception and one other method of contraception) at least 4 weeks prior
             to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 12 months
             post-treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she
             or her partner are participating in this study and for 12 months after study

                  contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding

               -  Women who have had tubal ligation

          -  Female patients may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the
             following reasons:

               -  The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral
                  salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy

               -  Pre-pubertal females; the parent or guardian of young female patients who have
                  not yet started menstruation should verify that menstruation has not begun; if a
                  young female patient reaches menarche during the study, then she is to be
                  considered as a woman of childbearing potential from that time forward

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded unless brain metastases have been
             resected or successfully treated with stereotactic radiosurgery and the patient has
             been free from central nervous system (CNS) recurrence or progression for 3 months

          -  Preclinical studies indicate that RO4929097 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inducer of
             CYP3A4 enzyme activity; caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097
             concurrently with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and/or inhibitors; furthermore,
             patients who are taking concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or
             substrates of CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any
             potential risk; the following medications with strong potential for interaction are

             stable atrial fibrillation that require antiarrhythmics or other medications known to
             prolong corrected QT interval (QTc); psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements; patients may have had another cancer but
             there must be convincing clinical evidence that the melanoma is the disease requiring
             therapeutic intervention

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
