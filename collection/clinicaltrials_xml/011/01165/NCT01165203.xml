      This observer-blind study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GlaxoSmithKline
      (GSK) Biologicals' investigational Herpes Zoster (HZ) vaccine GSK1437173A in Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected subjects, firstly enrolling subjects treated with
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) and with high CD4 T cell counts, and subsequently ART-treated
      subjects with low CD4 T cell counts, and ART-naïve subjects with high CD4 T cell counts.
