      The purpose of this observer-blind study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GSK
      Biologicals' meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 as compared to Menactra® in subjects 10 through
      25 years of age. In addition, this study will compare the immunogenicity of two lots of GSK

             period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to vaccination. (For corticosteroids,
             this will mean prednisone &lt;10 mg/day, or equivalent, is allowed. Inhaled and topical
             steroids are allowed.)

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             within one month of the dose of vaccine, with the exception of any licensed

          -  Previous vaccination with vaccine components within the last month.

          -  History of meningococcal disease.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including
             human immunodeficiency virus infection, based on medical history and physical
             examination.

          -  A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, until the immune
             competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.

          -  History of allergic reactions or disease likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             either vaccine, or by dry natural rubber latex.

          -  History of any neurologic disorders, including Guillain-Barré Syndrome.

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrollment.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
