      The purpose of this study is to see whether subjects with gout who receive febuxostat or
      allopurinol for up to 9 years have a higher rate of serious heart and blood vessel
      complications (major cardiovascular events). Examples of major cardiovascular events include
      heart attacks, strokes, and angina (chest pain due to narrowing of the blood vessels of the
      heart) that need to be treated urgently with a heart operation. The overall duration of the
      study is dependent on the number of predefined major cardiovascular events (MACE). The
      length of study is expected to be approximately 9 years in order to observe the required 624
      MACE. The length of study participation for each subject will vary due to the event driven
      study design.

      The purpose of this study is to see if subjects with gout who receive febuxostat or
      allopurinol, once daily (QD), have a higher rate of serious heart and blood vessel
      complications.

      This is a phase 3B multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study designed
      to evaluate the cardiovascular (CV) safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol in
      subjects with gout and significant CV comorbidities. Approximately 7500 subjects, males 50
      years of age or older or females 55 years of age or older (at least 2-years
      post-menopausal), with gout and health problems affecting the heart or blood vessels will
      take part in this study at approximately 450 study centers in North America.

      This study will use competitive enrollment. This means that when a target number of subjects
      has entered the treatment phase of the study, all further screening of subjects will be
      closed. The length of the study is based on an ongoing review of study results. The
      participation will last a maximum of 9 years and will include a maximum 28 visits to the
      study center. Telephone contact will be made every 2 months for subjects who have
      discontinued the study drug for any reason, but who are asked to continue in the study to be
      followed for potential cardiovascular events. This study design is called a &quot;Time to Event
      Study&quot;. All study subjects will continue to be followed until enough information has been
      gathered to determine the overall safety of the study drug.

      Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid in the body, and is associated with a broad range
      of conditions including heart disease, chronic kidney disease and additional risk factors
      like obesity and high blood pressure. Hyperuricemia, which is defined as an elevation in
      serum urate levels, develops into gout when urate crystals form from supersaturated body
      fluids and settle in joints and other organs.

      People with gout may also have a higher incidence of other conditions that may be associated
      with hyperuricemia, gout or both. This is supported by a growing body of research
      demonstrating that serum urate levels are an independent predictive factor for
      cardiovascular disease when the effects of other risk factors have been controlled.

      This study will explore the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat to determine whether the use
      of febuxostat is associated with a moderate increase in the risk of serious adverse
      cardiovascular outcomes as compared to allopurinol.

      Participation will last a maximum of 5 years and will include 15 to 20 visits to the study
      center.
