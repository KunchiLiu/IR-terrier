  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving clofarabine and cytarabine together with
      filgrastim works in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and/or advanced myeloproliferative neoplasm. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as clofarabine and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving the drugs in different doses may kill more cancer cells. Colony stimulating factors,
      such as filgrastim, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or
      peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of
      chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the complete remission (CR) rate of this regimen as compared with 7 + 3
      standard induction with the 90 mg/m^2/dose of daunorubicin (historical control) in
      previously untreated patients with AML or advanced MDS or advanced myeloproliferative
      neoplasm less than age 65.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the event free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and treatment related
      mortality of this regimen.

      II. To assess the toxicity of this regimen in previously untreated patients. III. To
      determine whether 3 consolidation chemotherapy cycles consisting of G-CSF (filgrastim),
      clofarabine, and cytarabine (GCLAC) can be administered with prompt recovery of blood
      counts.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning the day
      prior to chemotherapy and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients receive
      clofarabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour followed by cytarabine IV over 2 hours daily for
      5 days.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive filgrastim SC daily for 5 days beginning the day
      prior to chemotherapy. Patients receive clofarabine IV over 1 hour followed by cytarabine IV
      over 2 hours daily for 4 days.

      Treatment with induction therapy may continue for up to 2 courses and treatment with
      consolidation therapy may continue for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 5 years.
