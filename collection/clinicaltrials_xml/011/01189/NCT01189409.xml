      This is a study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two laxatives for treatment of
      opioid-induced constipation in adult outpatients with cancer treated at the BC Cancer Agency
      Pain and Symptom Management/Palliative Care clinics. Each participating patient will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One group will be started on a bowel protocol of escalating doses of sennosides, plus a
      dummy polyethylene glycol (lactose), and the other will receive dummy sennosides capsules
      (lactose)plus polyethylene glycol, with the same dosing protocol. After three weeks the
      patients will switch to the alternate active product and dummy preparation. The total
      duration for the study will be 6 weeks for each patient.
