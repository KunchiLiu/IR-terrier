    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an increase in the dose of sorafenib when
      given over five instead of 7 days/week, will result in an improvement of the response rate
      (degree of shrinkage of your cancer) and an improvement in the length of time that sorafenib
      will control your cancer, without causing a significant increase in side effects.

    <textblock>
      In 2006, an estimated 38,890 people in the United States were diagnosed with kidney cancer
      and greater than 12,000 died from the disease. Kidney cancer that has spread to other parts
      of the body is one of the most treatment-resistant diseases. Standard of care treatment
      usually involves chemotherapy. Results from chemotherapy have been disappointing. Therefore,
      there is a need to develop additional safe and effective therapies to treat advanced kidney
      cancer.

      Sorafenib (Nexavar®) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced kidney
      cancer. Sorafenib works by interfering with a type of protein in your body that determines
      how your kidney cells work and grow. Sorafenib at standard doses for 400mg(two pills)
      twice/day, given seven days/week, may slow progression of the disease for an average of
      three months but it is not expected to be curative. Preliminary studies have suggested
      higher doses of sorafenib may increase the chance that the tumor will shrink.

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)≥ 1,500/mm3

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN

               -  and AST ≤ 2.5 times the ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for patients with liver involvement)

               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 times ULN

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 7 days prior to of treatment.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study.
             Men should use adequate birth control for at least three months after the last
             administration of sorafenib.

          -  Ability to understand and willing to sign written informed consent. A signed informed
             consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures.

          -  INR &lt; 1.5 or a PT/PTT within normal limits unless receiving anti-coagulation
             treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin. These patients may be allowed to
             participate. For patients on warfarin, the INR should be measured prior to initiation
             of sorafenib and monitored at least weekly, or as defined by the local standard of
             care, until INR is stable.

          -  Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma that is
             metastatic (M1). Patients with unresectable primary tumor (but MO) are also eligible.

          -  Must have measurable disease, defined as at least 1 lesion that can be accurately
             measured in at least 1 dimension. Soft tissue disease that has been radiated in the 2
             months prior to registration is not assessable as measurable disease. Soft tissue
             disease within a prior radiation field must have progressed to be considered
             assessable. X-rays, scans or physical examinations used for tumor measurement must
             have been completed within 28 days prior to registration. X-rays, scans or physical
             examinations for non-measurable disease must have been completed within 42 days prior
             to registration.

          -  Patients with metastatic disease who have a resectable primary tumor and are deemed a
             surgical candidate may have undergone resection and have recovered from surgery. At
             least 28 days must have elapsed since surgery and must have recovered from any
             adverse effects of surgery.

          -  May have received 1 prior immunotherapy with either interferon (IFN) and/or
             Interleukin-2 (IL-2) or the combination of IFN/IL2 and only 1 prior biologic agent
             (sunitinib, bevacizumab, or temsorlimus). Must have progressed during this prior
             therapy. At least 14 days must have elapsed since the last treatment and must have
             recovered from any adverse effects of prior therapy. May have received prior
             radiation therapy. At least 21 days must have elapsed since completion of prior
             radiation therapy. Must have recovered from all associated toxicities at the time of
             registration.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure &gt; class II NYHA. Must not have unstable
             angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or new onset angina (began within the last 3
             months) or myocardial infarction within past 6 months.

          -  Known brain metastasis. Patients with neurological symptoms must undergo a CT
             scan/MRI of the brain to exclude brain metastasis.
