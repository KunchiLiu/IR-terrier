  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study on Altitude Illness. From the information collected and studied in
      this project we hope to learn more about Altitude Illness, including factors that may affect
      and prevent the development and progression of this condition. We hope to learn if the
      commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, ibuprofen can prevent altitude
      illness. Possible participants in this study are healthy adults who indicated they would
      like to participate, learn about altitude illness, and desire to hike Barcroft Peak.
      Stanford University researchers hope to enroll about 100 participants.

      This study was designed to bring together elements of prior studies and go one step further
      for definitive data on several points. The trial will employ two pharmaceutical intervention
      arms, which will compare placebo (the standard of care - information on prevention of
      altitude sickness) with the widely used NSAID ibuprofen. We will also determine Optic Nerve
      Sheath Diameter (ONSD) measurements via ultrasound in both the control and interventional
      arms. We will accomplish these objectives with a prospective, double blinded view of a large
      population of hikers who are ascending at their own rate in a true hiking environment: The
      White Mountain Research Station Owen Valley Lab (OVL) and Bancroft Station (BAR).

      Primary hypothesis: Ibuprofen 600 mg TID will be superior to placebo in decreasing both the
      incidence and severity of AMS in high altitude travel.
