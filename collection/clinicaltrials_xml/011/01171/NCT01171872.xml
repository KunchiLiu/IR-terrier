      The causes of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC), are unknown and diagnosing them is often difficult. This research is being done to
      find the genes that may increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease, and to identify
      specific protein substances that are related to IBD. The investigators are also looking at
      cell factors that may predict response to treatment for IBD. In IBD, cells of the
      gastrointestinal tract (your gut) do not seem to respond to certain substances in a normal
      way. Scientist have discovered that the immune system, made up of cells and chemicals that
      defend your body from infections, is working in a way that damages the walls of the gut. You
      are being asked to join in this study because you are going to have an surgical procedure
      performed related to your diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or for other
      medical reasons (for comparison purposes). If you join this study, the investigators will
      study the cells in the resected tissue from your gut to find out why some cells do not act
      in the normal way in people with IBD as compared to people without IBD. The more the
      investigators understand about how differently these cells are working, the better doctors
      and scientists will be able to someday help people with IBD.

      The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)—Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC)—are chronic, frequently disabling diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. CD and UC
      have an estimated combined prevalence of 0.2% to 0.3% in the United States, and are two to
      eight times more prevalent in Jewish Americans of Central or Eastern European descent
      (Ashkenazi Jews) as compared to non-Jewish Americans. CD may involve any part of the
      gastrointestinal tract, but most often the colon and terminal ileum. Bowel inflammation is
      discontinuous, transmural, and may contain granulomas. CD is also associated with bowel
      stenoses and intestinal and perianal fistulas. UC, by contrast, involves continuous,
      non-granulomatous inflammation of the colon and rectum, limited to the mucosal layers.
      Fistulas are not observed. Colonic disease that cannot be clearly identified as CD or UC is
      designated &quot;indeterminate colitis&quot;.

      IBD has a prevalence of ~ 0.2% of the Western population. In the United States alone, there
      are more than a million diagnosed IBD patients. IBD results in enormous suffering and
      health-care costs. In addition, repeated GI inflammation puts individuals at an increased
      risk of developing colon cancer. Although there are currently a variety of clinical
      treatments to alleviate the symptoms of IBD patients, and increasing therapeutic options are
      being developed as a result of ongoing research, there is no cure for the diseases. In
      addition, long-term usage of some of the current therapies, such as glucocorticoids and
      immunosuppressive agents, can be associated with serious side-effects. Progress has been
      made in recent years in understanding the pathological mechanisms of IBD, particularly in
      the search of IBD susceptibility genes. However, due to the extreme complexity of the
      diseases, there is still a long way ahead in elucidating detailed molecular mechanisms of
      IBD pathogenesis and identifying more effective therapeutic targets. Therefore, it is the
      goal of this research study to discover biomarkers and protein factors involved in the
      pathogenesis of IBD which may pave the way for the identification of more effective
      therapeutic targets.

      Hypothesis: In addition to exploration of differential gene expression using microarray
      technology, the investigators wish to identify protein factors that are involved in the
      pathogenesis of IBD. Initial proteomic studies of IBD patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)
      and Crohn's disease (CD) are proposed. The hypothesis to be tested is that, by identifying
      proteins that are differentially expressed or modified in IBD vs normal intestine, the
      investigators will increase the current understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD and of the
      associated diarrhea. Using 1-D and 2-D gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and Western
      blot screening, the preliminary studies have demonstrated that 1) a large number of proteins
      are differentially expressed in IBD intestinal mucosa vs normal mucosa. Some of these
      protein have been identified, and 2) three membrane transport proteins, Na+/H+ exchanger 3
      (NHE3), ClC Cl- channel 5 (ClC5) and Na+/K+-ATPase, are significantly down-regulated in IBD
      mucosa, suggesting a potential explanation of IBD-associated diarrhea. The investigators
      propose to extend the preliminary studies with two specific aims. AIM 1. Identify proteins
      that are changed in expression and post-translational modification in the intestinal mucosa
      of patients with active UC or CD compared to i) uninvolved intestinal mucosa from the same
      patients, ii) normal intestinal mucosa in control subjects, and iii) infectious/Inflammatory
      colitis (C. difficile colitis). To increase the chances of identifying changes in relatively
      low abundant proteins, the investigators will first separate total cellular proteins into
      several subfractions according to their detergent-solubility and the sizes of protein
      complexes. Protein expression and modification will then be analyzed by either 1-D/2-D
      gel/DIGE/MS technology (DIGE, Differential Image Gel Electrophoresis; MS, Mass
      Spectrometry), or electrospray LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography MS/MS), from either total
      mucosa, or villus and crypt cells or lamina proprial cells isolated by laser capture
      microdissection (LCM). AIM 2. Identify changes in the expression of intestinal membrane
      transporters for Na absorption and Cl secretion, including NHE3, in the intestinal mucosa of
      patients with active UC or CD compared to i) uninvolved intestinal mucosa from the same
      patients, ii) normal intestinal mucosa in control subjects, and and iii)
      infectious/Inflammatory colitis (C. difficile colitis). Transporters of interest will be
      identified using large-scale targeted screening by Western blot analysis. The targeted
      screening will also include several intestinal epithelial brush border-associated
      PDZ-containing proteins that have been recently shown to regulate trafficking and activity
      of membrane transporters. The ultimate goal is to identify therapeutic targets to cure IBD
      or alleviate the symptoms of IBD.
