    <textblock>
      BRF113710 is a Phase II, single-arm, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of GSK2118436 administered twice daily as a single agent in subjects with BRAF
      mutant metastatic melanoma. Subjects will receive 150 mg of GSK2118436 twice daily and
      continue on treatment until disease progression, death, or unacceptable adverse event.

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as Assessed by the Investigator for Participants Who Had a BRAF V600E Mutation</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study medication to the first documented evidence of a confirmed complete response or partial response (up to 26.9 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A participant was defined as a responder if he/she achieved either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be &lt;10 mm in the short axis.) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters [e.g., percent change from Baseline]). To be assigned a status of PR or CR, a confirmatory disease assessment was required at Week 12 if an initial response was seen at the Week 6 scan. Initial responses (CR/PR) that occured at Week 12 or later were required to be confirmed not less than 4 weeks and not more than 6 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Response was determined by investigator assessment as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.</description>

    <description>A participant was defined as a responder if he/she achieved either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions.

To be assigned a status of PR or CR, a confirmatory disease assessment had to have been performed at Week 12 if an initial response was seen at the Week 6 scan.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator and an Independent Reviewer for Participants Who Had a BRAF V600E Mutation</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study medication to the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause (up to 9.9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the first dose of study medication and the earliest date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was based on radiographic or photographic evidence, and assessments were made by the investigator/independent reviewer according to RECIST, version 1.1. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g., percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5 millimeters (mm). For participants who received subsequent anti-cancer therapy prior to the date of documented progression or death, PFS was censored at the last adequate assessment. For participants who did not have a documented date of progression or death, PFS was censored at the date of last adequate assessment.</description>

        <description>A participant was defined as a responder if he/she achieved either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be &lt;10 mm in the short axis.) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters [e.g., percent change from Baseline]). To be assigned a status of PR or CR, a confirmatory disease assessment was required at Week 12 if an initial response was seen at the Week 6 scan. Initial responses (CR/PR) that occured at Week 12 or later were required to be confirmed not less than 4 weeks and not more than 6 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Response was determined by investigator assessment as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator and an Independent Reviewer for Participants Who Had a BRAF V600E Mutation</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the first dose of study medication and the earliest date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was based on radiographic or photographic evidence, and assessments were made by the investigator/independent reviewer according to RECIST, version 1.1. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g., percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5 millimeters (mm). For participants who received subsequent anti-cancer therapy prior to the date of documented progression or death, PFS was censored at the last adequate assessment. For participants who did not have a documented date of progression or death, PFS was censored at the date of last adequate assessment.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator and an Independent Reviewer for Participants Who Had a BRAF V600K Mutation</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the first dose of study medication and the earliest date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was based on radiographic or photographic evidence, and assessments were made by the investigator/independent reviewer according to RECIST, version 1.1. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g., percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5 millimeters (mm). For participants who did not die, PFS was censored at the date of last contact.</description>
