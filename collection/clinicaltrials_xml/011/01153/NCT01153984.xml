  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-arm, multi-center study will evaluate the effect of Tarceva
      (erlotinib) on progression-free survival and the incidence and type of biomarkers in
      patients with advanced and/or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor (EGFR) positive mutations. Eligible patients will receive Tarceva 150mg po
      daily. The anticipated time on study treatment is until progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
