      The purpose of this study is to determine the changes in trabecular bone architecture in
      women 60 and older with high risk of fracture treated with either teriparatide or zoledronic
      acid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall design is to determine and compare the effect of teriparatide and of zoledronic
      acid on trabecular architecture by magnetic resonance microimaging of the midshaft tibia.
      Fifty-six postmenopausal women, aged 60 or older with osteoporosis and/or at increased risk
      of fracture, will be randomized to receive either teriparatide or zoledronic acid. Both
      groups will be followed for 24 months. Trabecular microarchitecture, cortical structural
      parameters, biomechanical parameters and bone mineral density will be examined at 0, 12, and
      24 months.

    <description>The MRI involves virtual bone biopsy technology currently being developed. This new technology is not commercially or elsewhere available. It allows generation of 3D images of considerably smaller voxel size than the previous technology by employing new pulse sequences and advanced interpolation techniques. The enhanced resolution will enable capturing subtle remodeling-induced changes, such as reversal of the fenestration caused by prior osteoclastic resorption cavities. It will also permit measurement of trabecular thickness with increased accuracy and precision. Advances have also been made toward superior registration of follow-up scans relative to the baseline scans. This, we project, provides improved reproducibility and thus increased statistical power.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with pamidronate, ibandronate, of more than 2 doses in 2 years and
             of zoledronic acid at any time

             an estrogen or selective estrogen modulator will not exclude a potential subject
             unless she has been taking it for &lt; 1 year (a woman who discontinued estrogen or a
             selective estrogen receptor within the previous year will also be excluded)

             D deficiency

             the subject will be excluded from the study

          -  Abnormalities of the which delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia

          -  Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes
