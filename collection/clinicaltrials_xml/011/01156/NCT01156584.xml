    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, ascending-dose trial of the safety and tolerability of
      increasing doses of Toca 511, a Retroviral Replicating Vector (RRV), administered to
      subjects with recurrent high grade glioma (rHGG) who have undergone surgery followed by
      adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Subjects will recieve Toca 511 via
      stereotactic, transcranial injection into their tumor. Cohort 7 &amp; 9 will receive Toca 511 as
      an intravenous injection given daily for 3 &amp; 5 days respectively. Approximately 3-4 weeks
      following injection of the RRV, treatment with Toca FC will commence and will be repeated
      approximately every 6 weeks until study completion or enrollment in the continuation study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an ongoing, intensive search for novel therapies to improve the prognosis of
      patients with the most common and aggressive form of primary brain cancer, glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM). Gene transfer is one such approach. Early gene-transfer studies with
      replication incompetent vectors showed this approach to be generally safe, but ineffective
      due to limited transduction of the tumor. More recently gene transfer has been attempted
      with oncolytic, replicating viruses. However these viruses are rapidly cleared by the immune
      system. To overcome these shortcomings of previous gene transfer protocols, Toca 511 has
      been developed utilizing a Retroviral Replicating Vector (RRV). This platform has the
      following potential advantages: 1) The vector only infects dividing cells, 2) The virus
      stably integrates into the genome of the tumor cells allowing for the potential for
      long-term control of the tumor, 3) The virus is not intrinsically oncolytic and is not
      cleared from the tumor by the immune system, and 4) The virus has been engineered to express
      the prodrug-activator, cytosine deaminase (CD), a gene that catalyzes the intracellular
      conversion of the antifungal drug, 5-FC (flucytosine) to the cytotoxic drug 5-FU. In both
      xenograft and syngeneic intracranial mouse tumor models the Toca 511/5-FC combination was
      able to significantly increase the survival of treated animals. The goal of the current
      trial is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Toca 511 administered intratumorally to
      patients with recurrent GBM followed by cyclic treatment with the prodrug 5-FC.
