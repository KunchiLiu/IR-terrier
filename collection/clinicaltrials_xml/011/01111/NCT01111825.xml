  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and benefit of two new drugs for the
      treatment of breast cancer. The patient is eligible for the study because their breast
      cancer has grown in spite of standard treatment. The two drugs tested in the study,
      Neratinib and Temsirolimus, will be given together. Also, this study will help the
      investigators learn why therapy directed against HER2 sometimes stops working.

      Phase I Design

      A standard, 3+3, dose escalation schedule will be used. Between 6 and 12 patients will
      likely be necessary to determine the MTD of temsirolimus in combination with neratinib.
      There will be no intrapatient dose escalation. The starting dose of temsirolimus is 8 mg
      administered intravenously weekly (dose level 1). Three patients will initially be enrolled
      in each cohort. The Phase I portion is closed to enrollment.

      Phase II Design

      The phase II portion of this trial will be comprised of two cohorts—HER2-amplified and
      triple negative breast cancer—each of which has a Simon two-stage design to determine the
      efficacy of temsirolimus when administered in combination with neratinib. Both pathologic
      subtypes of patients will be studied separately though accrual will be simultaneous.
      Response (RECIST criteria) will be assessed every 8 weeks (every 2 cycles) after the start
      of therapy. As of 2/10/12, the Triple-negative cohort is closed to accrual. The HER2-
      amplified cohort will continue to enroll as planned up to a total of 34 patients.
