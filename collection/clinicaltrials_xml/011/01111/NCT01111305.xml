      Background:

        -  Loa loa is a parasitic worm that infects people in West and Central Africa and is
           spread by the bite of a deerfly. Adult worms (macrofilariae) live under the skin and
           cause symptoms such as swellings, itching, and hives. Smaller worms (microfilariae) are
           found in the bloodstream. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC), the recommended medication for Loa
           loa infection, can produce very serious side effects, especially in people with high
           numbers of parasites in the blood. Researchers are investigating new treatments for Loa
           loa that have fewer or less serious side effects.

        -  DEC is the standard treatment for Loa loa infection, but it can cause mild side effects
           in persons with low numbers of parasites in their blood, including itchiness, muscle or
           joint pains, or swelling of the face or limbs. Currently, there is no way to
           effectively prevent these side effects.

        -  Researchers believe that a certain kind of blood cells called eosinophils, which
           increase in the blood after DEC treatment, may be one of the causes of the side effects
           seen with DEC treatment. Reslizumab is a drug that helps prevent the increase of
           eosinophils in the blood. Giving reslizumab before DEC treatment might prevent the
           eosinophils from increasing and thereby might reduce some of the side effects from DEC.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether reslizumab can prevent or reduce the side effects of treatment
           with DEC for Loa loa infestation.

        -  To evaluate the effect of reslizumab as part of the treatment for Loa loa infestation.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have lived in or traveled to a
           loa-endemic region for at least 1 month. (Loa-endemic regions include northern Angola,
           Cameroon, Central African Republic, People s Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea,
           Gabon, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.)

        -  Participants must have low numbers of parasites in the blood, as determined by the
           screening part of the study.

      Design:

        -  This study will last 24 months and will involve several visits to the National
           Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

        -  Participants will be screened with a blood test for Loa loa parasites. Those who have a
           low number of Loa loa parasites in the blood will be asked to return for a full medical
           evaluation and the start of the treatment phase. Those who do not have Loa loa
           parasites in the blood, or those who have a high number of Loa loa parasites in the
           blood, are not eligible for this study treatment but may be eligible for other
           parasitic disease studies conducted by the National Institutes of Health.

        -  Participants will have an initial visit with a full physical evaluation, and blood and
           urine tests (including leukapheresis to provide sufficient numbers of blood cells for
           testing).

        -  Within 1 month of the first visit, participants will have a single infusion of either
           reslizumab or a placebo. The infusion visit is estimated to last approximately 5 hours.

        -  Three to 7 days after the infusion, participants will begin a 21-day course of DEC
           (taken by mouth) to treat the infection. Participants will stay overnight at the
           Clinical Center during the first 3 days of treatment with DEC to be monitored for side
           effects, and will continue to take the DEC at home after the inpatient treatment. A
           study coordinator will call participants each day to ask about any symptoms or side
           effects.

        -  Participants will be seen for an additional eight outpatient follow-up visits (at days
           7, 14, and 28, and months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24) for evaluation of signs and symptoms of
           infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) treatment of Loa loa infection is complicated by the
      development of severe adverse reactions that are correlated with the number of circulating
      microfilariae in the blood. The cause of these reactions is unknown, but they are
      accompanied by a dramatic interleukin-5 (IL-5)-dependent increase in eosinophilia and
      evidence of eosinophil activation. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind pilot
      study (conducted at the NIH Clinical Center) will assess whether and to what extent the
      administration of reslizumab (Cinquil ), a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against
      IL-5, given 3 to 7 days before administration of the anthelminthic drug DEC (at 3 mg/kg 3
      times daily for 21 days), prevents the development of eosinophilia in 10 adult subjects with
      Loa loa infection and 0-5000 microfilariae/mL. Secondary outcomes will include the severity
      of post-treatment effects, markers of eosinophil activation, and effects of reslizumab on
      microfilarial clearance.
