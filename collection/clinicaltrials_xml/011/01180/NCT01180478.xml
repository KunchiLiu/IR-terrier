      The purpose of this study is to compare the recurrence rate at 1 year following Narrow Band
      Imaging and trans-urethral resection of bladder tumor with White Light and TURB in patients
      with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

      Currently bladder tumors are diagnosed visually with standard cystoscopy that uses white
      light, or light that is generated encompassing the entire visual spectrum. Some tumors such
      as carcinoma in situ may not be visible using white light and require patients to undergo
      random bladder biopsies in order to find the cancer. Recently the development of
      photodynamic agents have been shown to enhance these procedures to accomplish better
      resection and identify over-looked tumors. However, these methods often require the
      instillation of dyes into the bladder as well as specialized cystoscopes. Narrow band
      imaging (NBI) is now available which uses a special filter to limit the light to only
      certain wavelengths which allows the identification of areas of increased vascularity or
      abnormalities without the need for dyes. NBI has been investigated in gastro-intestinal
      disease and found to be beneficial. Early reports in urology suggest that this technology
      may reduce the number of tumors that are missed which could impact the recurrence rate of
      bladder tumors, but this is not known at this time.
