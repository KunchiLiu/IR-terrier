  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test, in a randomized clinical trial of 200 hemodialysis
      patients, a behavioral intervention to reduce dietary sodium intake. The investigators will
      assess the impact on weight gain between dialysis treatments, blood pressures, symptoms, and
      health-related quality of life. The primary study hypotheses are that participants will gain
      less weight in between dialysis treatments, and that dietary recalls will demonstrate
      reduced consumption of dietary sodium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the single most common cause of death in hemodialysis (HD)
      patients. Most HD patients have left ventricular hypertrophy(LVH), a significant predictor
      of death in this population. LVH is related to extracellular volume expansion and
      hypertension, both of which are amenable to dietary sodium restriction. However, dietary
      change is widely known to be difficult to achieve and sustain. Controlling dietary sodium is
      particularly difficult for HD because many foods are naturally high in sodium, and most
      prepared/prepackaged foods have significant amounts of sodium added to enhance taste and
      shelf-life. Research on behavioral methods that are effective in reducing dietary sodium
      intake in HD is very limited. The purpose of this study is to test, in a randomized clinical
      trial of 200 HD patients, a behavioral intervention, paired with PDA-based dietary
      self-monitoring, to enhance adherence to dietary sodium restrictions. Specifically the
      investigators will: (a) Assess the impact of the intervention on average daily interdialytic
      weight gains (IDWG-A). (b) Examine the impact of the intervention on self-reported dietary
      sodium intake. The study hypotheses are that compared to the control group, the intervention
      group will: (1) demonstrate a statistically significant decline in IDWGA over the 4-month
      intervention period, and (2) experience a greater decline in dietary sodium intake.
      Secondarily, the investigators will explore the impact of the intervention on: (a)
      pre-dialysis pulse pressure and mean arterial blood pressure, (b) hemodialysis dietary
      self-efficacy, and (c) intradialytic and postdialytic symptoms and general health-related
      quality of life. In addition, the investigators will characterize the barriers/facilitators
      to adherence to the HD dietary regimen and patient experience of the intervention through
      the use of qualitative methods. The intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory.
      Self-monitoring within the context of the intervention is operationalized as PDA-based
      dietary recording using BalanceLog software. Participants randomized to the attention
      control will receive computerized dietary education. Attention control participants will be
      offered an abbreviated version of the intervention after the 4-month study period concludes.
      Differences in IDWG-A, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure will be examined using a
      random intercept linear regression modeling. Self-reported dietary sodium, self-efficacy,
      symptoms, and quality of life will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 4 month and
      differences will be examined using repeated measures modeling using GEE. Qualitative
      analysis of narrative data will be performed.
