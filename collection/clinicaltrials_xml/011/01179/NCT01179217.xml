  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test the effects of L-glutamine on red blood cells of
      patients with Sickle Cell Anemia or Sickle ß0-Thalassemia. Glutamine is a part of protein
      and is a part of a person's normal diet. It is often used as a nutritional supplement or as
      medication for various medical problems such as intestinal problems. The benefits of
      participating in this study may be a decrease in pain and other problems caused by sickle
      cell disease.

             (documented by hemoglobin electrophoresis).

          -  Patient has had at least two documented episodes of sickle cell crises within 12
             months of the screening visit.

          -  If the patient has been treated with an anti-sickling agent within three months of

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a significant medical condition that required hospitalization (other than
             sickle cell crisis) within two months of the screening visit.

          -  Patient has prothrombin time INR &gt; 2.0.

          -  Patient has serum albumin &lt; 3.0 g/dl.

          -  Patient has received any blood products within three weeks of the Screening Visit.

          -  Patient has uncontrolled liver disease or renal insufficiency (refer to Appendix 3
             for guidelines).

          -  Patient is pregnant or lactating or has the intention of becoming pregnant during the
             study (if female and of child-bearing potential).

          -  Patient is currently taking or has been treated with any form of glutamine supplement
             within 30 days of the screening visit.

          -  Patient has been treated with an experimental anti-sickling medication/ treatment
             within 30 days of the screening visit (with the exception of hydroxyurea in pediatric
             patients).

          -  Patient is currently taking or has been treated with an investigational drug within
             30 days of the screening visit (with the exception of hydroxyurea in pediatric
             patients).

          -  Patient is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study and/or has
             participated in such a study within 30 days of the screening visit.

          -  There are factors that would, in the judgment of the investigator, make it difficult
             for the patient to comply with the requirements of the study.
