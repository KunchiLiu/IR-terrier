      Currently, the estimated number of people with diabetes mellitus is around 250 million. Due
      to population growth, urbanization, ageing and the rising prevalence of obesity the numbers
      of individuals with diabetes is increasing likewise. It has been shown that improving
      glycemic control is associated with a reduction in late complications of diabetes, such as
      cardiovascular and microvascular diseases. Therefore, treatment guidelines were established
      internationally by large and renowned associations and adopted by many countries.

      For Switzerland only sparse data exist on the actual implementation of such recommendations
      and on patient's well-being. The SwissDiab Pilot Study is a prospective cohort study aiming
      at the collection of data on diabetic patients (type 1 and type 2) at two tertiary hospitals
      in Switzerland. This allows the evaluation of diabetes treatment strategies at these
      centers. Furthermore, risk indicators for micro- and macrovascular complications, mortality
      as well as costs and quality of life will be assessed. Data will be recorded through an
      internet-based, electronic database specifically designed for this study. At a later
      perspective it is planned to extend data collection to general practitioner/family doctor
      networks in order to include a larger and more representative sample of diabetic patients in
      Switzerland.

      Background

      Currently, approximately 250 million people worldwide are affected by Diabetes Mellitus. Due
      to population growth, urbanization, ageing and the rising prevalence of obesity the numbers
      of individuals with diabetes will grow. The American Diabetes Association estimated the
      total cost of diabetes in the US in 2007 at $174 billion. The greatest share of those costs
      results from the treatment of diabetes-associated complications caused by prolonged
      hyperglycemia. There is compelling evidence that tight glycemic control and intensive
      treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors substantially reduce the risk of developing
      being also cost-effective. Our current knowledge, however, is mainly derived from
      intervention trials usually including strictly defined patient groups and are carried out
      according to meticulous study protocols. Observational studies, however, in unselected
      outpatient settings have revealed discrepancies between recommended treatment goals
      resulting from those latter studies and actual standard of care. There is a pressing need,
      therefore, to assess the standard of care and confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of
      proposed management trends in both specialty clinic and community-based cohorts.

      Objective

        1. To design and implement an internet-based database for data collection and management
           at two tertiary hospitals.

        2. To evaluate the current and future standard of care of patients with diabetes mellitus
           (type 1 and type 2), the distribution of micro- and macrovascular complications, the
           use of therapeutics and devices as well as aspects of costs and quality of life.

        3. To compare data with data from the historic Swiss sub-cohort of the WHO Multinational
           Study of Vascular Disease if possible.

      Methods

      After obtaining informed consent, patients with diabetes mellitus willing to participate
      will be invited to an initial comprehensive assessment (baseline) performed at either of the
      two cantonal study centers (Inselspital Bern or Kantonsspital St. Gallen). This will be
      followed by face-to-face clinical/laboratory visits between one to four times yearly
      according to patient's individual management plans. Once a year a comprehensive review
      including clinical and laboratory screening for diabetes-specific complications is planned.

        All patients with diabetes above age 18 are eligible for this study, irrespective of
        duration of diabetes or treatment. Diabetes will be defined according to the current
        diagnosis criteria suggested by the American Diabetes Association (fasting plasma glucose
        ≥ 7mmol/L, occasional plasma glucose ≥11.1mmol/L (plus typical symptoms), a 2hour plasma
        glucose of ≥11.1mmol/L after a 75g oral glucose tolerance test, or a HbA1c ≥ 6.5%), but
        patients under treatment with ≥2 oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) and/or insulin in the
        absence of proof of a diagnosis by fasting, random plasma glucose or oral glucose
        tolerance test will also be included. The type of diabetes will be diagnosed clinically in
        most cases. In equivocal cases classification will be based on previously reported
        criteria with the assistance of laboratory test results.
