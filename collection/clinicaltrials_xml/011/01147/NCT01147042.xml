      Background:

      - Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an immunodeficiency disease in which white blood
      cells are unable to kill certain bacteria and fungi. People with CGD are more likely to
      develop recurrent life-threatening infections. Certain changes or mutations in genes
      contribute to the severity of CGD, and also appear to affect the success of treatment with
      interferon-gamma, a substance that is used to improve the immune system s ability to fight
      infection. Researchers are interested in studying changes in the immune system caused by
      interferon-gamma treatment of CGD in individuals with different mutations that cause CGD.

      Objectives:

      - To compare changes in the immune system caused by interferon-gamma treatment for CGD in
      individuals with different mutations that cause CGD.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals of any age who have been diagnosed with CGD and have specific types of
      mutations that cause CGD (to be determined after testing).

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood
           and urine tests. Participants must weigh more than 11 kilograms (~24 pounds) to
           participate in the study.

        -  Participants will receive injections of interferon-gamma once weekly for 4 weeks, twice
           weekly for 4 weeks, and then three times weekly for 4 weeks (a total of 24 injections).

        -  Blood will be drawn periodically during treatment and for 8 weeks after the treatment,
           for a total of 21 weeks on the study. Participants will regularly provide information
           on their symptoms and responses to treatment to the study researchers.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is caused by mutations of 1 of the 4 proteins comprising
      the NADPH oxidase that result in decreased or absent production of superoxide by phagocytes,
      and predisposes CGD subjects to life-threatening infection. Intensive management with
      antibiotics and antifungal agents has dramatically increased the life expectancy of subjects
      with CGD. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which increases superoxide production by neutrophils
      and enhances their antimicrobial activity, is an FDA approved therapy for CGD and is now the
      standard of care. However, there is substantial variability in the biochemical and clinical
      response to IFN gamma treatment. Recently, the specific mutations of the genes responsible
      for causing CGD in most of the subjects followed at the NIH have been characterized. Because
      of this, it is now known that the severity of the disease is correlated not only with
      inheritance pattern, but also with the specific underlying mutation. It is not known,
      however, if the biochemical response to IFN gamma therapy correlates with the specific
      mutation as well.

      Since treatment with IFN gamma is expensive, requires frequent injections, and in some
      subjects results in systemic side effects, it would be useful to determine whether the
      biochemical response and systemic side effects correlate with the underlying mutation GCD.

      We hypothesize that subjects with X-linked CGD due to nonsense/frameshift/RNA
      processing/deletion mutations of the gp91phox component of the NADPH oxidase will generate a
      smaller biochemical response to IFN gamma therapy compared to subjects with missense
      gp91phox mutations or the autosomal recessive form of CGD that results from mutations of the
      p47phox or p67phox components.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the predictability of IFN_F responsiveness
      in CGD based on mutational analysis. compare the change in function of the NADPH oxidase
      during treatment with an escalating dose of IFN_ompasubjects with CGD resulting from
      missense or nonsense/frameshift/RNA processing/deletion gp91phox mutations or mutations of
      p47phox or p67phox. The secondary objectives are to assess changes in superoxide production,
      expression of NADPH oxidase components, neutrophil bactericidal capacity for Staphyloccus
      aureus, cytokines, cell surface markers, antibodies, lymphocyte subsets, constitutional
      symptoms , and gene expression in leukocytes from subjects with missense gp91phox mutations,
      nonsense/frameshift/RNA processing/deletion gp91phox mutations, p47phox mutations, and
      p67phox mutations after treatment with IFN_R to assess changes in the expression of NADPH
      oxidase components, cytokines, cell surface markers, antibody production, production of
      various lymphocyte subsets, constitutional symptoms and gene expression in leukocytes from
      these subjects following treatment with IFNg. This knowledge will assist physicians in
      determining which subjects are likely to respond to full dose and alternative dose therapy
      with IFNg and provide information about biochemical responses of to these regimens in
      subjects with specific CDG gene mutations enabling them to better counsel and manage
      subjects with CGD.

        Study Groups/Cohorts:

        X-linked CGD Nonsense/Frameshift/RNA Processing/Deletion Mutations Cohort: Subjects in
        this cohort must have X-linked CGD resulting from a documented nonsense, frameshift, RNA
        processing, or deletion gene mutation. Subjects with other gene defects or for whom the
        specific genetic defect has not been determined are not eligible for inclusion in this
        cohort.

        X-linked CGD Missense Mutation with Low Baseline Superoxide Production (less than or equal
        to 2.5 nmol/10(6) cells/hr) Cohort: Subjects in this cohort must have X-linked CGD
        resulting from a documented missense gene and superoxide production by cytochrome c
        reduction assay at baseline of less than or equal to 2.5 nmol/10(6) cells/hr. Subjects
        with other gene defects or for whom the specific genetic defect has not been determined
        are not eligible for inclusion in this cohort.

        X-linked CGD Missense Mutation with Higher Baseline Superoxide Production (greater than
        2.5 nmol/10(6) cells/hr) Cohort: Subjects in this cohort must have X-linked CGD resulting
        from a documented missense gene and superoxide production by cytochrome c reduction assay
        at baseline of greater than 2.5 nmol/10(6) cells/hr. Subjects with other gene defects or
        for whom the specific genetic defect has not been determined are not eligible for
        inclusion in this cohort.

        Autosomal Recessive p47phox CGD Cohort: Subjects in this cohort must have autosomal
        recessive CGD resulting from a documented p47phox gene mutation. Subjects with other gene

        Autosomal Recessive p67phox CGD Cohort: Subjects in this cohort must have autosomal
        recessive CGD resulting from a documented p67phox gene mutation. Subjects with other gene
        defects or for whom the specific genetic defect has not been determined are not eligible
        for inclusion in this cohort.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects are excluded from the study who:

          1. Have undergone successful bone marrow transplantation;

          2. Had a serious adverse reaction to IFN gamma in the past;

          3. Are pregnant or breast feeding;

          4. Weigh less than 11 kg;

          5. Are currently on therapy with INF gamma;

          6. Have any of the following medical conditions:

               -  Coronary artery disease;

               -  Hepatic disease and/or liver enzymes elevated above 3 times normal;

               -  Seizure disorder, or

               -  Severe myelosuppression (absolute neutrophil count less than1000 cells/mm(3)).

        Participation of Minors: minor patients will be invited to participant in this study.

        Participation of Women: Exposure to IFN gamma by the developing human fetus may be
        detrimental. For this reason, women of childbearing-age will have a pregnancy test prior
        to undergoing study procedures. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is
        pregnant while participating in this study, she should immediately inform study staff and
        her primary care physician.

        Pregnancy and Lactation: The effects of IFN gamma therapy on the developing fetus and
        newborn infant have not been studied. Therefore, it is not recommended that subjects who
        are pregnant or breast-feeding receive IFN gamma and they will be excluded from this
        study.
