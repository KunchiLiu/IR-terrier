    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a single intravenous infusion of
      autologous umbilical cord blood (UCB) for the treatment of pediatric patients with spastic
      cerebral palsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy results from in utero or perinatal injury to the developing brain, often
      through stroke, hypoxic insult or hemorrhage. Currently available treatments for patients
      with cerebral palsy are supportive, but not curative. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been
      shown to lessen the clinical and radiographic impact of hypoxic brain injury and stroke in
      animal models. UCB also engrafts and differentiates in brain, facilitating neural cell
      repair, in animal models and human patients with inborn errors of metabolism undergoing
      allogeneic, unrelated donor UCB transplantation. We hypothesize that, in the setting of
      brain injury, infusion of autologous UCB will facilitate neural cell repair resulting in
      improved function in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy.
