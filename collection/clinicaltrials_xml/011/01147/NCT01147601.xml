  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about a new potential use for topical timolol 0.5%
      aqueous solution that may help treat small uncomplicated infantile hemangiomas. This study
      would examine whether topical timolol could be a potential therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the first visit, subjects will fill out a questionnaire that asks about the child's
      history and the hemangioma. Photographs and measurements will be taken at this and each
      subsequent visit. At the first visit, subjects will have a physical exam, including vital
      signs, height and weight. An EKG will also be done. Study drug will be dispensed and
      instructions given. Half of the subjects will receive a placebo. This is a blinded
      randomized study. Follow-up visits will be weekly for the first two weeks (three visits
      total including the first visit), then monthly until the study is over. Photographs and
      measurements will again be taken at each visit. Subjects will be asked to evaluate the size
      and the color of the hemangioma against the first photographs and fill out forms regarding
      any changes in behavior and asked about any side effects.

    <time_frame>at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be generated by asking each of the assessors to score the improvement using a visual analog scale (VAS) assessing the decrease in size of hemangioma by comparing photographs at different times of treatment. The assessors will score this improvement into one of the following categories: 0-24%, 25-49%, 50-74%, &gt;75%.</description>

    <description>The proportion of subjects in the treatment group as compared to the placebo control group with at least 50% improvement in the extent of the hemangioma.
The difference between the extent/size of the hemangioma as an outcome measure versus color changes.
Frequency of adverse events (e.g. hypotension, behavioral changes, etc.), collected by the investigator and reported by the parents.</description>
