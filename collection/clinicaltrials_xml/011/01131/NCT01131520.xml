  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness in reducing drug use and its
      associated problems of a brief intervention for drug use delivered by a behavioral health
      counselor as compared to a brief intervention delivered by a computerized intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug use is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Efforts to
      develop and rigorously evaluate methods to provide Screening, Brief Intervention and
      Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) for drug users are needed. Computerized screening and brief
      interventions in particular have the potential to circumvent some of the potential problems
      of integrating SBIRT delivered by a counselor into busy primary care settings. These
      interventions may reduce drug use among individuals who are using drugs but are not yet drug
      dependent.
