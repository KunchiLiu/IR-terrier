      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors
      predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in patients with diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma treated with combination chemotherapy with or without rituximab.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify genes predictive of clinical outcome (failure-free survival and overall
           survival) among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with CHOP or R-CHOP
           induction on ECOG-E4494 using the nuclease protection assay for measuring gene
           expression in paraffin-embedded tissue.

        -  To identify genes that change their prognostic profile with the addition of rituximab
           to CHOP chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Unstained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples are analyzed for gene expression via
      nuclease protection assay.
