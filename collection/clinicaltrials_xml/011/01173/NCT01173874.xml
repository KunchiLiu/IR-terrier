      OVERVIEW &amp; SPECIFIC AIMS Marked cognitive impairment underlies much of the social &amp;
      occupational dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. Currently available antipsychotic
      medications are primarily effective in treating psychotic symptoms &amp; have demonstrated only
      limited potential in ameliorating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia patients.

      Lurasidone is a novel compound synthesized by SEPRACOR, Inc.for the treatment of patients
      with schizophrenia &amp; bipolar disorder. It possesses high affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin
      5-HT2A, 5-HT7, 5-HT1A &amp; noradrenaline α2C receptors. Compared with other atypical
      antipsychotics, lurasidone demonstrates similar binding affinities for the D2 &amp; 5-HT2A
      receptors, but greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. Lurasidone displays no
      affinity for histamine H1 or acetylcholine M1 receptors. In animal studies, lurasidone
      significantly reversed memory impairment induced by MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
      receptor antagonist, in a rat step-through type passive avoidance task. The maximum
      inhibitory effects of lurasidone were greater than those observed with risperidone,
      quetiapine, &amp; olanzapine, while aripiprazole was not effective in reversing the impairment
      induced by MK-801. Additionally, lurasidone significantly reversed memory impairment induced
      by the anticholinergic drug scopolamine in the passive avoidance task. The reversal of
      pharmacologically induced cognitive deficits in rats by lurasidone is promising &amp; warrants
      specific investigation in subjects with schizophrenia, given the prominence of cognitive
      deficits in this disorder.

      From a different therapeutic perspective, the utility of cognitive remediation in
      ameliorating cognitive deficits &amp; improving functional outcomes in schizophrenia has
      recently been evaluated in several studies. A meta-analysis of these trials found effect
      sizes for improvement in cognitive &amp; psychosocial functioning in the low to moderate range
      (McGurck 2007). The best outcomes in psychosocial functioning were evident when cognitive
      remediation was combined with teaching of psychosocial skills.

      Given the recalcitrant nature of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia &amp; their impact on
      functional capacity we felt that in designing a study to test the effectiveness of cognitive
      remediation we should maximize the likelihood of therapeutic benefit by administering
      cognitive remediation in the context of pharmacotherapy that may have potential for
      precognitive effects. By so doing we could possibly boost the effect sizes seen with
      cognitive remediation alone. In this study we will transition patients with schizophrenia
      (in whom a change in antipsychotic therapy is clinically warranted) from their current
      antipsychotic to lurasidone - clinicians will have eight weeks to complete the switch.
      Subjects who are successfully switched to lurasidone will then be randomized to receive
      either cognitive remediation or a non-specific mental activity control condition two
      times/week for a total of 30 sessions over a 4-6 month period. Our goal is to have 140
      patients complete the cognitive remediation phase.

      A subset of the sample will participate in 2 biomarker studies. Event related potentials &amp;
      fMRI will be done in these subjects at baseline &amp; study completion.

      This study will be done as an Investigator initiated trial (J. Lieberman, M.D. - PI) under a
      separate IND.

      Primary Aim: We hypothesize that cognitive remediation will be superior to the active
      control group on the change from baseline to study end point of cognitive remediation phase
      on both co-primary outcome measures (standardized composite MATRICS score &amp; Cognitive
      Assessment Interview).

      Additional aims

        1. To compare cognitive remediation to active control on functional outcome as assessed by
           the change in UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA-Brief) from baseline to
           end point of cognitive remediation phase.

        2. To compare cognitive remediation to active control on changes from lurasidone
           stabilized baseline to end point in indices of functional brain activation (ERP &amp; fMRI)
           during cognitive activation tasks.

        3. Evaluate the effect of 8 weeks of lurasidone treatment on cognitive &amp; functional
           outcomes as assessed by changes from baseline in the MATRICS composite score, CAI, &amp;
           UPSA-Brief.

        4. Evaluate the effect of cognitive remediation compared to nonspecific mental activity on
           cognitive &amp; functional outcomes as assessed by changes from lurasidone stabilized
           baseline to end of cognitive remediation phase in the MATRICS composite score, CAI, &amp;
           UPSA-Brief.

        5. Evaluate the efficacy, safety, &amp; tolerability of lurasidone in patients with
           schizophrenia as assessed by the change from baseline to week 8 &amp; to end of cognitive
           remediation phase in the PANSS total score, Side Effect Checklist, AIMS, SAS, BAS, &amp;
           frequency of abnormal laboratory values.

           BACKGROUND &amp; SIGNIFICANCE

           A broad range of neurocognitive abnormalities characterizes patients with
           schizophrenia. These include impairments in attention (including abnormalities in
           sensory gating), visual &amp; verbal learning &amp; memory, working memory, processing speed,
           social cognition, &amp; executive function, (Nuechterlein et al, 2004), &amp; are major
           determinants of poor functional outcome (Green, 1996; Green et al, 2004). Conventional
           antipsychotics have limited effects on these impairments. Second generation
           antipsychotics may have modest benefits for cognitive function although recent
           literature does not support an advantage over first generation antipsychotics (Davidson
           et al, 2009). Regardless, most patients continue to exhibit pronounced cognitive
           impairment despite adequate antipsychotic treatment &amp; these deficits result in much of
           the social &amp; occupational dysfunction associated with schizophrenia.

           A number of investigations have examined the impact of cognitive remediation on
           cognition in schizophrenia subjects. A recent meta-analysis of cognitive remediation
           trials (McGurck et al. 2007) found a low to moderate effect size for improvement in
           cognitive performance (effect size 0.41), &amp; psychosocial functioning (effect size
           0.36). Interestingly, the effects of cognitive remediation on psychosocial functioning
           were significantly greater in those studies that provided adjunctive psychiatric
           rehabilitation (effect size 0.47) than in those that provided cognitive remediation
           alone (effect size 0.05). In other words, a basic cognition-enhancing strategy had to
           be combined with the teaching of psychosocial skills &amp; strategies to see clinically
           meaningful effects in psychosocial functioning (which is the ultimate goal of any
           cognitive remediation intervention).

           Of all the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, verbal learning &amp; memory are among the
           most abnormal. Abnormalities are present at the earliest stages of auditory processing
           as evidenced by the abnormally low amplitudes of the mismatch negativity response
           obtained during the pre-attentive detection of auditory stimuli. Reduced mismatch
           negativity responses are significantly associated with impaired verbal memory, with the
           inability to decode semantic &amp; emotional aspects of speech, &amp; with poor functional
           status. These findings suggest that efficient auditory processing is crucial for the
           successful encoding &amp; retrieval of verbal information &amp; that disturbance in these
           elemental processes are related to higher-order cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia
           (Fisher et al 2009).

           Based on this body of evidence &amp; on data from animal experiments in the basic
           neuroscience of learning-induced neuroplasticity, a cognitive training program that
           targets both early auditory processing &amp; working memory operations was developed by
           Posit Science with the goal of improving verbal memory performance in patients with
           schizophrenia. Interim findings from an ongoing study to evaluate the effectiveness of
           this approach were recently published (Fisher et al 2009). 55 patients with
           schizophrenia who were clinically stable on various antipsychotics were assigned either
           to the cognitive training program developed by Posit Science (50 sessions administered
           5X/week over 10 weeks), or to a computerized game control condition to mimic the time &amp;
           concentration at a computer required in the cognitive training program. Primary outcome
           was the change from baseline in the Measurement &amp; Treatment Research to Improve
           Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) test battery. The group that received cognitive
           training showed impressive &amp; significantly larger improvements than the control group
           on global cognition, verbal working memory, &amp; verbal learning &amp; memory at effect sizes
           in the medium to large range (.56 to .86). Important questions not addressed by this
           study were the optimal dose &amp; duration of the cognitive remediation intervention, the
           tolerability &amp; efficacy of the intervention in below average IQ schizophrenia
           populations, the persistence (or lack thereof) of the improvement in cognitive function
           after cessation of the cognitive remediation, the functional significance of the gains
           in cognitive function, &amp; the contribution, if any, of the type of antipsychotic
           therapy. Additionally, it is unlikely that patients in typical clinical settings would
           be able to comply with such a rigorous daily cognitive remediation program without the
           financial incentives that were provided to subjects in this study.

           As noted above, studies of cognitive remediation have thus far included subjects on
           whatever antipsychotic they were taking at study entry. It is well known that the
           antihistaminergic &amp; antimuscarinic properties of antipsychotics may further impair
           cognitive processes in schizophrenia patients. Additionally, antipsychotics vary
           considerably in their EPS liability, which can affect cognitive processing &amp; motor
           speed. Thus, choice of antipsychotic therapy would appear to be an important
           consideration in the design of cognitive remediation trials in schizophrenia patients
           although no studies thus far have attempted to control for this important variable.

           Lurasidone is a novel compound synthesized by Sepracor for the treatment of patients
           with schizophrenia &amp; bipolar disorder. It possesses high affinities for dopamine D2,
           serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT7, 5-HT1A &amp; noradrenaline α2C receptors. Compared with other
           atypical antipsychotics, lurasidone demonstrates similar binding affinities for the D2
           &amp; 5-HT2A receptors, but greater affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. Lurasidone
           displays no affinity for histamine H1 or acetylcholine M1 receptors. As of September
           02, 2008, approximately 1560 people had received lurasidone in various types of
           clinical studies (e.g., single doses ranging from 0.1-100 mg, repeated doses up to 600
           mg/day for less than one week, &amp; repeated doses up to 120 mg/day for 6 weeks of
           treatment &amp; up to 80 mg/day for 12 months of treatment). This included approximately
           263 healthy volunteers &amp; 1309 schizophrenic or schizoaffective disorder subjects.
           Another 600 subjects are currently enrolled in ongoing, placebo-, &amp; active comparator
           controlled Phase 3 studies. Double-blind placebo-controlled &amp; open label studies
           lasting 6-8 weeks in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia, were suggestive
           of a therapeutic dose range of lurasidone of 40mg/day to120 mg/day given once daily.

           Of special interest in animal studies was the observation that lurasidone significantly
           reversed memory impairment induced by MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
           antagonist, in a rat step-through type passive avoidance task. The maximum inhibitory
           effects of lurasidone were greater than those of risperidone, quetiapine, &amp; olanzapine,
           while aripiprazole was not effective in reversing the impairment induced by MK-801.
           Additionally, lurasidone significantly reversed memory impairment induced by the
           anticholinergic drug scopolamine in the passive avoidance task. The reversal of
           pharmacologically induced cognitive deficits in rats by lurasidone &amp; the differences
           observed from other antipsychotics is promising &amp; warrants specific investigation in
           subjects with schizophrenia.

           In this study we propose to build on the important work done thus far in cognitive
           remediation in schizophrenia by addressing some of the limitations of previous studies.
           All subjects will be stabilized on lurasidone prior to initiation of cognitive
           remediation. This will provide a uniform foundation of antipsychotic therapy with an
           agent that might have pro-cognitive effects. Cognitive remediation initiated in
           schizophrenia patients stabilized on lurasidone treatment could potentially provide a
           synergistic benefit on cognition &amp; functioning. At a minimum, lurasidone would not be
           expected to worsen cognitive functioning, as it has no M1 or H1 antagonist activity.
           The cognitive remediation intervention will be administered in small group settings
           twice weekly for 30 sessions &amp; will utilize computerized &amp; verbal group training
           exercises to address basic skills such as auditory processing, attention, processing
           speed, &amp; verbal working memory &amp; learning, as well as intermediate &amp; complex skills
           such as deductive reasoning, planning &amp; sequencing, set shifting, &amp; complex problem
           solving. Software exercises from Posit Science will be used to address the deficits in
           basic cognitive skills. Cognitive remediation sessions will include a 55 minute session
           in which the subject engages in cognitive exercises on the computer followed by a 20
           minute &quot;bridging&quot; component in which participants gather in a circle to discuss skills
           practiced, how they might use that skill in real world tasks, &amp; to learn other
           non-computer based techniques to enhance their cognitive &amp; psychosocial skills in order
           to meet their overall recovery goals. Outcome measures include improvement in cognition
           as assessed by the MATRICS &amp; CAI, &amp; functional outcome using UPSA-B. Two biomarker
           assessments (ERP &amp; fMRI) will also be conducted in a subset of subjects at baseline &amp;
           study completion.

           Our goal in this study is to conduct a scientifically rigorous clinical trial that
           optimizes the likelihood of meaningful improvement in cognitive &amp; psychosocial
           functioning in patients with schizophrenia. An important consideration in the study
           design is that the intervention is practical &amp; can be implemented in regular clinical
           settings. Biomarker assessments will provide valuable information on neuroanatomical &amp;
           pathophysiological substrates of cognitive impairment &amp; the effect of therapeutic
           interventions.

           PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS

           The daily dose of lurasidone will be flexibly dosed at 40, 80 or 120 mg based solely on
           clinical considerations &amp; investigator judgment. All these doses have been demonstrated
           in large double-blind placebo-controlled trials to be effective in the management of
           acute exacerbation as well as maintenance treatment of schizophrenia.

           COGNITIVE REMEDIATION

           The Cognitive Remediation program has two principal parts: (1) individualized
           computer-based cognitive training allows participants to hone their cognitive skills
           through repeated exercises which gradually increase in difficulty &amp; complexity (2)
           &quot;bridging&quot; group therapy sessions facilitate the transfer &amp; application of newly
           learned cognitive skills to everyday situations &amp; recovery goals. A building block
           approach to session planning will be used, with learning blocks increasing in
           complexity from Basic to Intermediate to Complex. Three dimensions determine complexity
           of the tasks:

             -  Cognitive skill emphasized by the activity (one versus multiple skills)

             -  Cognitive load of the activity (difficulty of task)

             -  Goal properties of the tasks (proximal versus distal, highly specific versus
                complex)

           Within each learning block are sessions that introduce an assortment of computerized
           cognitive exercises, which build upon previous skills learned, but are not reliant on
           achieving 100% accuracy before progressing. Thus foundation skills need to be
           completely mastered to progress onto more complicated tasks. The overarching training
           model is to introduce basic cognitive skills in the beginning block, with tasks that
           target one or two cognitive skills, have proximal goals, &amp; low cognitive load. In
           addition to exercising the requisite basic cognitive skills, this facilitates
           self-efficacy &amp; task valuation, which in turn enhances motivation. Increasingly tasks
           become more complex &amp; touch upon various cognitive domains. In this manner, multiple
           domains are engaged simultaneously - as is the case when the participant must navigate
           everyday life outside the laboratory setting.

           The &quot;building block&quot; approach allows the participant to gradually train each cognitive
           skill necessary for higher order executive functioning. The ultimate goal is to teach
           memory techniques &amp; the problem-solving skills to successfully steer through tasks not
           only on the computer but in everyday life

           Non-specific mental activity Active Control Group (ACG). Participants will be enrolled
           in twice weekly group that works on various computerized puzzles &amp; mentally stimulating
           exercises for total of 30 hours within a 6 month timeframe. Commercially available
           puzzles games that provide engaging but non-specific mental stimulation will be used as
           the active control training exercises. Participants will follow similar session
           timeframe as CR groups followed by healthy lifestyle groups.

           Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Clinical Trial (SCID-CT) The Structured
           Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Clinical Trial Version (SCID-CT) will be used to confirm
           the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The SCID-CT is a semi-structured interview designed to
           evaluate DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses. It enables trained clinical raters to reliably
           determine Axis I diagnoses in diverse patient populations.

           Clinician-Rated Side-Effect Scales Patients are to be assessed for extrapyramidal
           symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, hyperkinesias, dystonia, akathisia,
           involuntary muscle contractions, athetosis, &amp; chorea.

           EPS-related side effects will be evaluated with the standardized scales of AIMS, SAS &amp;
           BAS.

           Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) The AIMS consists of 12 items, 10 to be
           rated on a 4-point scale of severity &amp; 2 to be rated as yes or no.

           Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) The SAS is a rating scale used to measure EPS &amp; consists of a
           list of 10 symptoms, each to be rated on a 5-point scale of severity.

           Barnes-Akathisia Rating Scale (BARNES) The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale will be used
           to assess the presence &amp; severity of akathisia before treatment (baseline) &amp; at the
           scheduled visits. This scale consists of 4 items (objective observation of akathisia by
           the investigator, subjective feelings of restlessness by the patient, patient distress
           due to akathisia, an global evaluation of akathisia). To complete this scale, subjects
           should be observed while they are seated &amp; then standing (for a minimum of two minutes
           in each position). Symptoms observed in other situations (e.g., while engaging in
           neutral conversation, engaging in activity) may also be rated. Subjective phenomena
           should be elicited by direct questioning.

           The Positive &amp; Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) The Positive &amp; Negative Syndrome Scale
           (PANSS) will be the primary assessment instrument for psychopathology.

           The PANSS contains 30 items that assess symptoms of psychotic disorders including
           positive, negative &amp; general psychopathology. The PANSS was chosen because of its
           widespread use in clinical studies of psychosis, &amp; its demonstrated reliability in
           assessing psychopathology across diverse patient populations. The PANSS includes items
           from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), with additional items from the
           Psychopathology Rating Schedule.

           Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI-S) The Clinical Global Impressions
           (CGI) Severity Scale will be used for repeated evaluations of global psychopathology.
           The CGI-S scale is widely used in schizophrenia research &amp; is a single Likert scale
           rating severity of psychopathology on a scale of 1 (normal, not ill) to 7 (very
           severely ill).

           Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) The CDSS is a nine-item scale
           specifically developed for assessment of depression in patients with schizophrenia.
           Compared with the HAM-D, there is less overlap between positive &amp; negative
           psychopathology. Items do not focus on weight change &amp; initial insomnia, both of which
           can be confounded by the drug treatment of schizophrenia. All items are rated on a
           four-point scale: 0=absent; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe.

           Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) The CSSRS is a low-burden,
           clinician-administered tool that covers the wide spectrum of suicidality from ideation
           to behavior. With suicide attempts too infrequent to serve as an outcome parameter,
           this suicide assessment scale provides a validated measure of such related variables as
           impulsivity, poor frustration tolerance, sadness, &amp; hopelessness.

           Service Utilization &amp; Resources Form -Short Form (SURFs) The Service Use &amp; Resources
           Form for Schizophrenia (SURFs) is a multi-item self-report form that comprehensively
           documents use of mental health &amp; non-mental health service use, including the number &amp;
           duration of contacts &amp; the specific types of agencies from which services were
           obtained.

           BIOMARKER STUDIES

           A total of 72 subjects (36 per group) will participate in each biomarker study (ERP &amp;
           fMRI). However we still anticipate a 50% total attrition from baseline to end point &amp;
           will therefore have to conduct baseline biomarker assessments in 144 subjects to yield
           72 completers &amp; 58 subjects with good data.

           EVENT RELATED POTENTIALS

           Verbal episodic memory processing will be examined by measuring event-related brain
           potentials (ERPs) during a continuous word recognition test, &amp; behavioral measures of
           verbal working memory will be obtained using a word serial position test (WSPT), both
           of which we have extensively used in our studies of schizophrenia (Bruder et al., 2004;
           Kayser et al., 1999; Kayser et al., 2006; Kayser et al., 2009). We have chosen to use
           the auditory version of both tests because ERP deficits were found to be particularly
           evident for spoken words (Kayser et al., 2009) &amp; this will enable assessment of changes
           in auditory processing following the cognitive remediation with Posit Science auditory
           training. ERP &amp; behavioral assessments will be conducted at baseline (on previous
           antipsychotic prior to switching to lurasidone) &amp; at study end point upon completion of
           cognitive remediation.

           ERPs During Verbal Episodic Memory: Studies using neuropsychological tests have found
           that patients with schizophrenia display a selective deficit in verbal learning &amp;
           memory (Saykin et al., 1991). Neuroimaging studies have linked the verbal episodic
           memory deficits in schizophrenia to left inferior frontal &amp; medial temporal lobe
           structures (Gur et al., 1994; Mozley et al., 1996). PET studies indicate that left
           inferior frontal cortex is involved in both encoding &amp; retrieval of words in a
           recognition memory task, &amp; schizophrenic patients show reduced activation of this
           region during both stages of episodic memory (Ragl&amp; et al., 2001).

           Episodic memory processes have also been examined by measuring brain ERPs during a
           continuous word recognition memory task (Friedman, 1990b). Subjects view or hear a
           series of words, some of which are repeated after a number of intervening words, &amp;
           their task is to decide whether each word is new (not previously presented) or old
           (previously presented). A robust, replicable finding in healthy adults has been greater
           ERP positivity to &quot;old&quot; as compared to &quot;new&quot; words about 250 to 800 ms after word
           onset, referred to as the 'old-new effect.' The old-new effect has been interpreted as
           a neurophysiologic representation of retrieval processes involved in consciously
           discriminating old from new words. Intracranial ERP recordings in &amp; around medial
           temporal lobe structures of epilepsy patients have revealed similar old-new effects,
           suggesting that the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus or amygdala may contribute to
           the scalp recorded effects (Elger et al., 1997).

           We have used a continuous word recognition paradigm to assess neurophysiologic
           correlates of episodic memory deficits in schizophrenic patients &amp; healthy controls
           (Kayser et al., 1999). In our most recent study (Kayser et al., 2009), schizophrenic
           patients showed poorer accuracy of word recognition, which is consistent with findings
           of impaired verbal memory in schizophrenia. Patients showed marked reductions the ERP
           old-new effect over lateral-parietal sites. Patients also lacked the
           left-greater-than-right hemispheric asymmetry typically observed for healthy adults.
           Impairments of these electrophysiologic correlates of episodic memory were most robust
           for auditory stimuli, which suggests a left-lateralized deficit in encoding &amp;/or
           retrieval of phonological information. Patients also showed reduced left-parietal P3 &amp;
           response-related mid-frontal negativity, likely associated with performance monitoring
           &amp; anterior cingulate cortex.

           We propose to record ERPs using essentially the same auditory word recognition task as
           in our prior study (Kayser et al., 2009). Words synthesized for a male voice (484 ms
           median duration) are presented binaurally through headphones at a comfortable level of
           about 70 dB SPL. A constant 2.5 s stimulus onset asynchrony &amp; a fixation cross to
           minimize eye movements are used. The words are selected from a dictionary of 925 nouns.
           Words are arranged in two lists of 80 items, pseudo-randomly assigning items to the
           lists with the constraint that item features (e.g., concreteness or imagery norms for
           words) are balanced across lists. For each list, an item sequence is constructed so
           that an equal number of words (n = 17) are repeated once following either a short lag
           (8 intervening items) or a long lag (24 intervening items). Thus, each sequence has 34
           words that repeat once, 17 at each lag, &amp; 46 filler words that do not repeat, yielding
           a total of 114 items per sequence. Items that are repeated are considered new items at
           the first presentation, &amp; old items at the second presentation, &amp; these repeated items
           would form the basis for the subsequent data analysis. In contrast, never-repeated
           words are considered filler items &amp; not included in the data analysis. Word
           presentation order is pseudo-randomized within each sequence to yield an equal
           distribution of short &amp; long lags. Participants are instructed to respond to every word
           as quickly &amp; accurately as possible by pressing one of two buttons on a response pad to
           indicate whether the word was &quot;new&quot; (never presented in the series) or &quot;old&quot;
           (previously presented). Prior to the first block, practice trials are administered with
           stimuli not used in the test to ensure that subjects understand the task &amp; are
           responding appropriately. Each session will consist of two blocks of 114 trials with a
           5 min rest interval between blocks. The retest session will also consist of two blocks,
           but with different words. Each session will take about one hour including electrode
           preparation. ERP &amp; behavioral data will be acquired at each site &amp; sent to NYSPI for
           processing &amp; analyses.

           Verbal Working Memory &amp; Tone Discrimination Tests: There is now considerable evidence
           that working memory is impaired in schizophrenia (Goldman-Rakic, 1991; Park &amp; Holzman,
           1992; Carter et al., 1998). We have found that schizophrenic patients, who performed as
           well as healthy controls on a tone discrimination test of perception &amp; attention,
           showed poorer performance than controls on an auditory verbal WM test, i.e., the Word
           Serial Position Test (WSPT), which requires short-term storage of the serial position
           of a series of four words (Bruder et al., 2004; Wexler et al., 1998). Moreover, when
           recording ERPs during this working memory test we found that patients having
           schizophrenia had reduced amplitude of P3 source over left inferior parietotemporal
           region (Kayser et al., 2006).

           The WSPT &amp; a tone discrimination screening test will be administered behaviorally after
           the ERP measures &amp; take about 30 min. In the WSPT (Wexler et al., 1998), each trial
           begins with a series of four nouns spoken in a male voice followed after a delay
           interval of 9 sec by one of these words. The subject's task is to remember the four
           words in the order presented &amp; to indicate the position of the probe word in the
           sequence. There are a total of 36 trials. Schizophrenic patients show poorer
           performance than healthy controls on this verbal working memory test (Bruder et al.,
           2004; Wexler et al., 1998). Moreover, patients who perform poorly on the tone screening
           test of auditory discrimination &amp; attention have a particularly marked deficit on the
           WSPT &amp; episodic memory tests, &amp; may benefit most from the auditory training approach to
           cognitive remediation (Posit Science). The tone discrimination task is simply to judge
           whether two pure tones separated by 100 ms are the same or different in pitch. There
           are 10 practice trials &amp; 60 test trials consisting of 30 trials where the tone pairs
           are the same pitch &amp; 30 trials where the tones are different, with 6 trials at each of
           five frequency ratios. The auditory ERP, WSPT, &amp; tone discrimination test may be of
           particular value as predictors of improvement in cognitive function following auditory
           training &amp; also for monitoring changes during cognitive remediation.

           fMRI OF WORKING MEMORY &amp; EPISODIC MEMORY

           Rationale: Working memory (WM), or the ability to hold information &quot;on line&quot; for short
           periods of time &amp; often (but not always) to manipulate that information (Baddeley
           1992), is considered to be one of the most fundamental cognitive impairments in
           schizophrenia. It is closely related to the construct of executive dysfunction.
           Deficits in both working memory &amp; executive processing have been related particularly
           to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Goldman-Rakic 1999; Weinberger 2001).
           The exemplar of the executive WM task, is the &quot;N-back&quot; task (Cohen 1994). The &quot;N-Back&quot;
           task requires &quot;continuous updating &amp; order memory.&quot; It has been used to assess WM
           function in schizophrenia in several neuroimaging studies &amp; has shown sensitivity to
           change as a function of pharmacological challenge in healthy controls (Mattay 2003) &amp;
           cognitive rehabilitation in individuals with schizophrenia (Wykes, 2002). Because of
           the relative simplicity of the N-back paradigm, activation can be measured in a shorter
           time period &amp; with fewer complexities than the Sternberg type task, &amp; is likely to
           yield robust data in a &quot;blocked&quot; design format in a substantially shorter time period
           than storage tasks.

           Episodic (Declarative) Memory Assessment Rationale: Episodic (declarative) memory will
           be assessed using intentional word encoding followed by a yes/no recognition test.
           Tests of this type robustly activate a range of brain regions known to be involved in
           the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, including inferior frontal cortex,
           parahippocampus, thalamus, parietal cortex &amp; hippocampus. Individuals with
           schizophrenia are impaired on episodic memory tasks, &amp; on tasks of this nature
           specifically. The paradigm chosen for this task is straightforward, easy for almost all
           individuals with schizophrenia to complete, relatively easy to implement in a multisite
           study, &amp; will allow for the assessment of both basic components of episodic encoding &amp;
           retrieval, as well as proactive interference effects in secondary analyses.
