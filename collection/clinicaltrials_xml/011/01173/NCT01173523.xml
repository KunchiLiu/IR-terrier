      STA-9090 blocks Heat Shock Protein-09 (Hsp90), which is thought to be involved in regulating
      apoptosis or cell death in small cell lung cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators will look to see if STA-9090 has a therapeutic
      effect on small cell lung cancer. The investigators will also study the safety of STA-9090
      and whether measuring circulating tumor cells may help in assessing response to treatment.

    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitive tumor, but with
      very high rates of relapse and metastasis, resulting in a very poor outcome. Among
      limited-stage patients, the relapse rate is at least 80% and among extensive-stage patients,
      the relapse rate is 95-98%. The impetus to develop more effective therapies against novel
      targets in SCLC is therefore high. Hsp-90 inhibitors are a new class of drugs with important
      anti-malignant potential in a variety of tumor types because of the reliance of multiple
      oncoproteins on Hsp90 function.

      Although small cell neuroendocrine tumors generally carry many mutated oncoproteins, without
      clearly defined clients for Hsp90 mediating inhibitor effects in these cells, a recent study
      demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibition causes massive apoptosis by activating the intrinsic
      apoptotic pathway in a number of SCLC cell lines. SCLC is a particularly attractive target
      for apoptosis inducing drugs because of high growth rates and evidence of molecular
      alterations affecting apoptotic mechanisms. STA-9090 is a novel, small-molecule inhibitor of
      Hsp90. Unlike earlier generations of Hsp90 inhibitors, STA-9090 has been shown to be a
      potent inducer of apoptosis in a variety of cell lines and has anti-tumor activity in
      multiple types of human xenografts. As was seen with other Hsp90 inhibitors, STA-9090 also
      induces apoptosis in a number of SCLC cell lines (T. Shimamura and G. Shapiro, personal
      communication).

      Based on the anti-tumor potential seen pre-clinically with Hsp90 inhibition, the potent
      effects of STA-9090 seen pre-clinically as compared with other inhibitors in the same class,
      as well as early data suggesting safety and tolerability of this drug in the Phase I
      setting, we are evaluating the single-agent activity of STA-9090 in a Phase II trial of
      patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer.
