      This is a proposed follow up study on the investigators previous gene transfer human
      clinical trial entitled &quot;Administration of a Replication Deficient Adeno-associated Virus
      Gene Transfer Vector Expressing the Human CLN2 cDNA to the Brain of Children with Late
      Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis&quot; (Weill Cornell IRB# 0401007010). As in the
      previous study, the investigators propose to administer a biologic by direct gene transfer
      into the brain and assess its safety on children with a fatal genetic disease of the CNS.
      The disease is Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (LINCL, a form of Batten
      disease). This will be accomplished by using delivery of a gene (method called gene
      transfer) to administer to the brain an experimental drug called AAVRh.10CUhCLN2, a gene
      transfer vector.

      The investigators propose to assess a new drug to treat children with a form of Batten
      Disease called Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (LINCL). These children are
      born with genetic changes called mutations in their CLN2 gene that result in the inability
      of the brain to properly recycle proteins. The recycling failure leads to death of the nerve
      cells in the brain and progressive loss of brain function. Children with Batten disease are
      normal at birth but by age 2 to 4 have motor and vision problems which progress rapidly to
      death at age approximately 10 years old. There are no therapies available to treat the
      disease.

      The experimental gene transfer procedure treatment the investigators propose consists of
      augmenting the abnormal gene by a good copy. A virus is used to deliver the good gene to the
      nerve cells. Since the disease is due to an abnormal CLN2 gene, the aim of this study is to
      add a normal copy of the CLN2 gene to the brain of affected children to try to reverse death
      of cells in the brain. Previously the investigators have used a virus called
      adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) as the gene delivery system. That study showed that viral
      delivery of the gene was safe. We now propose to use a slightly different virus called
      AAVrh.10 as a gene delivery system and use 2 different doses of the virus. Children with
      Batten disease will get the drug injected into the brain and will receive extensive
      neurological assessment at intervals to determine if the transfer slows the rate of progress
      of the disease.

      The primary aims of the study are: (1) to assess the hypothesis that direct administration
      of AAVrh.10CUhCLN2 to the brain of children with LINCL can be achieved safely and with
      minimal toxicity; and (2) to evaluate the hypothesis that direct administration of
      AAVrh.10CUhCLN2 to the brain of children with LINCL will slow down or halt progression of
      the disease as assessed by neurological rating scales and quantitative MRI (primary
      variables).

      The investigators have recently completed a study in which the normal copy of the gene was
      surgically delivered to 12 locations in the brain in 10 children with LINCL. The children
      were assessed by a number of neurological and imaging parameters prior to and after gene
      transfer. The data demonstrated that the gene transfer was well tolerated and had a small
      impact on the progression of the disease and suggested that higher doses and a better
      delivery system may provide greater benefit. The previous study used the viral gene transfer
      vector adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) at a dose of 2,000,000,000,000 molecules of the
      drug (2 x 10^12 particle units). The investigators now propose a very similar study with
      delivery of the identical payload with a slightly different viral gene delivery system based
      on the virus AAVrh.10.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All individuals who meet the following criteria will be included without bias as to a
        gender or race/ethnicity. Each case will be individually reviewed with the Eligibility
        Committee comprised of 3 physicians other than the PI, including a pediatric neurosurgeon,
        pediatric neurologist and general pediatrician.

          1. Definitive diagnosis of LINCL, based on clinical phenotype and genotype. The genotype
             must include at least one of the 5 most common CLN2 mutant genotypes: C3670T
             (nonsense Arg208 to stop), G3556C (intron 7 splice), G5271C (Gln422His), T4396G
             (aberrant splicing, intron 8) and G4655A (Cys365Tyr). If either parental allele is
             R447H, the patient will not be included in the study. These account for a total of
             83% of the mutations in the study by Sleat et al11, 32 and 82% of the mutations in
             our studies27. The study does not limit to one specific genotype (genetic
             constitution) since our data regarding the natural history of the disease (Appendix
             II) and the studies of Steinfeld2, show that, for these 5 genotypes (genetic
             constitution), LINCL subjects have similar clinical course.

          2. The subject must be between the age of 2 and 18 years.

          3. Subjects will have an average total score of 4 - 12 on the Weill-Cornell LINCL scale,
             and the total score should not be outside the 95th percentile confidence limits for
             age based on our historic data.

          4. The subject will not previously have participated in a gene transfer or stem cell
             study.

          5. Parents of study participants must agree to comply in good faith with the conditions
             of the study, including attending all of the required baseline and follow-up
             assessments, and both parents or legal guardians must give consent for their child's
             participation.

          6. Sexually active subjects will have to use contraception during the treatment and for
             2 months after completion of the treatment.

          7. If asymptomatic (i.e - An LINCL score of 12), has one older sibling who has a
             positive genotype and has clinical manifestations of the disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of other significant medical or neurological conditions may disqualify the
             subject from participation in this study, particularly those which would create an
             unacceptable operative risk or risk to receiving the AAVrh.10CUhCLN2 vector, e.g.,
             malignancy, congenital heart disease, liver or renal failure.
