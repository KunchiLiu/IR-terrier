  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the availability of home self-testing for
      HIV will increase HIV testing frequency among men who have sex with men without negatively
      impacting their risk for HIV acquisition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV counseling and testing remains one of the most effective HIV prevention interventions
      because many individuals newly diagnosed with HIV infection will alter their behaviors to
      reduce the risk of HIV transmission to others. In the U.S., men who have sex with men (MSM)
      represent the group with the greatest risk for HIV acquisition despite a high penetrance of
      testing, in part because their frequent exposures and infrequent testing can result in long
      intervals between HIV acquisition and diagnosis. Efforts to prevent HIV transmission among
      MSM must therefore increase the frequency of HIV testing and thereby decrease the time
      interval that infected individuals are unaware of their status and their potential for
      transmission. Home self-testing for HIV may increase the frequency of HIV testing, but there
      are concerns that it may also have negative consequences, including decreased access to risk
      reduction counseling.

      We will randomize 246 MSM at high risk of HIV acquisition either to have access to home
      self-testing for HIV using the OraQuick ADVANCE® Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test or to standard,
      clinic-based HIV testing for 15 months to determine the effects of home self-testing
      availability on HIV testing frequency and markers of risk for HIV acquisition and to assess
      the acceptability and ease of use of home self-testing. After screening to determine
      eligibility, study visits will occur at baseline and at 15 months. Both visits will include
      HIV/STD screening and surveys regarding HIV testing and risk behaviors. During follow-up,
      participants will be asked to complete brief online surveys after testing for HIV.

    <description>Participants in this arm will be given access to home HIV self-testing kits with the OraQuick ADVANCE® Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test for use with oral fluids. They will be trained to use this device to test themselves for HIV and be able to request up to one self-testing kit per month throughout follow-up.</description>

    <description>The device is the home HIV self-testing kit that includes the OraQuick ADVANCE® Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test for use on oral fluids. The kit itself is not the focus of this trial. As described in the Behavioral Intervention section, the intervention is having access to home self-testing for HIV.</description>
