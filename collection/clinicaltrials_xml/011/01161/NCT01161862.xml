    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that our closed-loop glucose-control system can provide BG
      control in subjects with type 1 diabetes using the estimated BG signal from a CGM as the
      input signal to the controller.

      The three specific aims of this study are:

      Aim 1: To test the safety and efficacy of our control system in the bi-hormonal
      configuration in regulating BG in adults (18 years of age or older) and in children (12-17
      years of age) with type 1 diabetes based on interstitial-fluid (ISF) glucose data from a
      CGM. Experiments will be 51 hours in length incorporating 6 meals and two (night) sleep
      periods. In order to evaluate the effect of exercise on BG control, the last 48 hours of the
      experiment will be divided into two 24 hour blocks, the second of which will contain a
      period of structured exercise near the beginning of the block.

      Aim 2: To test the safety and efficacy of our control system in the insulin-only
      configuration in regulating BG in adults (18 years of age or older) and in children (12-17
      years of age) with type 1 diabetes based on interstitial-fluid (ISF) glucose data from a
      CGM. Experiments will be 51 hours in length incorporating 6 meals and two (night) sleep
      periods. In order to evaluate the effect of exercise on BG control, the last 48 hours of the
      experiment will be divided into two 24 hour blocks, the second of which will contain a
      period of structured exercise near the beginning of the block.

      Aim 3: To directly compare the performance of the bi-hormonal and insulin-only
      configurations of the controller in adults (18 years of age or older).
