      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well EGEN-001 works in treating
      patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer
      that is persistent or has come back. Biological therapies, such as EGEN-001, use substances
      made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different
      ways and stop tumor cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months
      and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) in
      patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal carcinoma.

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect blood and peritoneal lavage fluid from patients that will be stored for future
      research.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive intraperitoneal EGEN-001 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

          -  Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
             protocol, if one exists; in general, this would refer to any active GOG phase III

          -  Patients who have received one prior regimen must have a GOG performance status of 0,
             1, or 2

          -  Recovery from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy:

               -  Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the
                  exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [UTI])

               -  Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at
                  least one week prior to registration; continuation of hormone replacement
                  therapy is permitted

               -  Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy,
                  biologic/targeted therapy and immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least
                  three weeks prior to registration

          -  Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for
             management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another
             organoplatinum compound; this initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal
             therapy, consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents or extended therapy administered after
             surgical or non-surgical assessment

          -  Patients who have received only one prior cytotoxic regimen (platinum-based regimen
             for management of primary disease), must have a platinum-free interval of less than
             12 months, or have progressed during platinum-based therapy, or have persistent

             cytotoxic regimen for management of recurrent or persistent disease according to the
             following definition:

               -  Cytotoxic regimens include any agent that targets the genetic and/or mitotic
                  apparatus of dividing cells, resulting in dose-limiting toxicity to the bone
                  marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa

               -  Note: patients on this non-cytotoxic study are allowed to receive additional
                  cytotoxic chemotherapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease, as
                  defined above; however, due to the novel nature of biologic compounds, patients
                  are encouraged to enroll on second-line non-cytotoxic studies prior to receiving
                  additional cytotoxic therapy
