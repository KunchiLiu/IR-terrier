  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot study to test the novel hypothesis that Exenatide
      treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes results in improved sleep duration and quality
      and to explore the relationship between improvements in sleep and measures of metabolic and
      circadian function. This project would be the first to probe the relationship between
      incretin hormone regulation, duration and intensity of sleep, glucose tolerance and
      circadian dysfunction in diabetic patients.
