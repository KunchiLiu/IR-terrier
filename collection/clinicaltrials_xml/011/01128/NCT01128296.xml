  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the research study is to determine whether treating pancreatic cancer
      patients with hydroxychloroquine in combination with gemcitabine before surgery is safe. The
      secondary goal is to determine if this new treatment regimen can effectively treat
      pancreatic cancer. This study will test the safety and efficacy of this combination in two
      parts, or phases.

      This is a phase I/II trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      neoadjuvant oral hydroxychloroquine (PlaquenilÂ®) in combination with FDR gemcitabine in
      subjects with high risk IIb or III adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Eligible subjects will be
      administered hydroxychloroquine orally once or twice daily (depending on dose) in
      combination with FDR gemcitabine (on days 1 and 15) for 31 days prior to surgical resection.
      Dose escalations of hydroxychloroquine will proceed using Storer's Up-and-Down algorithm D.
      Subjects will be monitored for side effects and tolerability of the drug. Pre- and
      post-treatment PET scans will be the primary means to assess response to therapy. Resected
      tumors will also be assessed for evidence of inhibition of autophagy as well as
      histopathologic response and margin negative resection and number of positive lymph nodes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To establish the safety and tolerability of a novel regimen of pre-operative oral hydroxychloroquine in combination with gemcitabine (GCHC) in patients with high risk stage IIb or III adenocarcinoma of the pancreas</measure>
    <time_frame>During 31 days of study drug regimen</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients experiencing DLT will be calculated for each dose level, with 90% exact binomial confidence intervals. The dose-toxicity function will be estimated by means of logistic regression, with dose considered as a continuous variable, along with 90% confidence intervals. The dose with estimated probability of toxicity closest to 1/6 will be reported as the recommended Phase II dose.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To establish the potential biologic activity and suitability for phase II study of GCHC, as determined by the rate of grade III or better histopathologic response.</measure>
    <time_frame>Surgical resection after 31 days of study drug regimen</time_frame>
    <description>The histopathologic response of patients will be tabulated by dose. The proportion of patients experiencing of grade III or better histopathologic response will be calculated for each dose level, with 90% exact binomial confidence intervals. The dose-response function will be estimated by means of logistic regression, dose considered as a continuous variable, along with 90% confidence intervals</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To establish the potential biological activity and suitability for phase II study of GCHC by radiographic tumor response, as assessed by [18F]- FDG PET.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to and after 31 days of study drug regimen (pre-surgical resection)</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic response will be assessed by category as described in the protocol and also by percent change in SUV from baseline. The proportions of CRs, SDs and PDs at each dose level will be calculated with 90% confidence intervals. The dose-response function will be estimated by means of a cumulative logit model (for ordered outcomes), with 90% confidence intervals. The dose-response model of percent change from baseline in SUV will be determined by linear regression, or, possibly, a generalized linear model.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the effects of hydroxychloroquine on the plasma pharmacokinetics and metabolism of gemcitabine</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 2, 3, 16, and 17</time_frame>
    <description>The following PK parameters will be determined: peak concentration (Cmax), the time to maximum concentration (Tmax), the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), volume of distribution Vz, Vz/Fm), clearance terms (CL, CL/Fm), elimination rate constants, and elimination half-lives (t1/2). The values for these parameters obtained in the presence of hydroxychloroquine therapy will be compared with historically reported values of gemcitabine pharmacokinetic parameters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker response (Ca 19-9), antibodies to cardiolipin, sMICA levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to and after 31 days of study drug regimen (pre-surgical resection), post-surgical resection, every 3 months until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship of change in Ca 19-9 to dose will be characterized by a linear, or, if necessary, generalized linear or nonlinear regression model, with appropriate confidence intervals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlate the level of autophagy in resected pancreatic adenocarcinomas with measures of clinical outcome, histopathologic response and [18F]- FDG PET.</measure>
    <time_frame>Surgical resection after 31 days of study drug regimen</time_frame>
    <description>Autophagy (LC3) in resected tissue will be a predictor in generalized linear models of these endpoints, with link and variance functions chosen according to the type of endpoint. Cumulative logit models will be appropriate for clinical outcome and histopathologic response, while a continuous GLM will be chosen for SUV, where the link and variance functions will be determined from exploratory graphical analyses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlate the levels of autophagic markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells with histopathologic response and changes in the [18F]- FDG PET activity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to and after 31 days of study drug regimen (pre-surgical resection), post-surgical resection, every 3 months until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>Changes across treatment in autophagic markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells cells (e.g., HMGB1) will be a predictors in generalized linear models of histopathologic response and FDG-PET activity, with link and variance functions chosen according to the type of endpoint, as above. Similarly, the effect of hydroxychloroquine dose on changes in serum antibodies to cardiolipin and serum soluble MICA will be modeled by initial graphical and descriptive display, followed by an appropriate linear or nonlinear regression model.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess coagulation parameters during the protocol treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to and after 31 days of study drug regimen (pre-surgical resection), post-surgical resection</time_frame>

          -  The effects of HCQ, and gemcitabine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation. All females of childbearing
             potential must have a blood test or urine study within two weeks prior to
             registration to rule out pregnancy. Should a woman become pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. If
             a man impregnates a woman while participating in this study, he should inform his
             treating physician immediately as well.

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with bone marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients are excluded
             from the study. For patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy, the
             potential impact of pharmacokinetic interactions with HCQ and gemcitabine is unknown.
             Appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients with HIV and those receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy in the future.

          -  Due to the risk of disease exacerbation, patients with porphyria are ineligible.
