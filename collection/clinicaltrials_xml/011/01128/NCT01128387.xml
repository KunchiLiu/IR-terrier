  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall study objective is to evaluate the dose limiting toxicities and the recommended
      phase II dose of Panitumumab when combined with the standard of care treatment with
      cisplatin, fluorouracil and radiation in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.
      The investigators will also be assessing the ability of PET imaging to predict the degree of
      pathologic response.

      All patients will have a pre-study FDG PET scan and will receive radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy over a 35 day period. 4-8 weeks post radiation and chemotherapy patients will
      be restaged with a PET/CT scan. It is anticipated that approximately 30 patients enrolled
      will undergo an esophagectomy which is considered standard of care post radiation and
      chemotherapy. The surgery will allow us to compare this study regimen to the historical
      standard of care (Cisplatin/fluorouracil chemotherapy with radiation therapy).
