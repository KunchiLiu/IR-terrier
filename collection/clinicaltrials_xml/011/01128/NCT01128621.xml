      A study in type 2 diabetic subjects on stable metformin therapy to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of co-administering single and multiple
      oral doses of GSK1292263

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      of GSK1292263 when co-administered with metformin. The study will be in 2 parts. Part A will
      determine the PK of GSK1292263 following single day dosing of type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
      subjects on metformin. Part B will investigate the effects of 14d of co-dosing of GSK1292263
      BID, 50mg BID of sitagliptin or placebo to 48 T2DM subjects taking metformin.

    <description>Part A is open label, in T2DM subjects on established metformin monotherapy. Subjects will receive a single dose of GSK1292263 with food. This will permit a comparison of GSK1292263 exposures in this cohort with those observed in study GPR111598 in which T2DM subjects were drug na√Øve or washed off prior anti-diabetic medications.</description>
