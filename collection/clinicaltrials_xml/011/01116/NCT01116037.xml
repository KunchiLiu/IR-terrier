    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to determine if there is an increased incidence and
      rate of aortic regurgitation in younger (&lt;/= 70 years of age) patients implanted with the
      Model 1000 and undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement of his/her native aortic valve,
      or replacement of a failed prosthesis.

      A multi-center non-randomized trial designed to obtain 606 patient years. Each enrolled
      patient will be followed for a minimum of six (6) years. Preoperative, discharge or 30 days
      (whichever comes last), 3-6 month, and annual follow-up data are required.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is &lt;/= 70 years of age and requires isolated aortic valve replacement with or
             without concomitant procedures such as coronary artery bypass or another valve
             reconstruction. (The three remaining valves must be of native tissue).

          -  Patient is sufficiently ill to warrant replacement of his/her diseased natural or
             prosthetic valve (excluding the ATS 3f Aortic Bioprosthesis, Model 1000
             bioprosthesis), based on standard cardiovascular diagnostic workups.

          -  Patient is in satisfactory condition, based on the physical exam and Investigator's
             experience, to be an average or better operative risk, (i.e., likely to survive three
             years postoperatively).

          -  Patient is geographically stable and willing to return to the implant center for
             follow-up visits.

          -  Patient has been adequately informed and consents to his/her participation in the
             clinical study, and of what will be required of him/her, in order to comply with the
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is older than seventy (70) years of age.

          -  Patient has a non-cardiac major or progressive disease, which in the Investigator's
             experience produces an unacceptable increased risk to the patient, or results in a
             life expectancy of less than 3 years.

          -  Patient is an intravenous drug and/or alcohol abuser.

          -  Female patient is pregnant (urine HCG test result positive), or lactating.

          -  Patient presents with active endocarditis.

          -  Patient presents with congenital bicuspid aortic anatomy.

          -  This patient presents with abnormal aortic root geometry.

          -  Patient has chronic renal failure or is on renal dialysis.

          -  Patient has a previously implanted prosthetic valve that is not being replaced by a
             study valve.

          -  Patient requires mitral, tricuspid or pulmonic valve replacement.

          -  Patient presents with dilatation of the ascending aorta, Marfan Syndrome,
             Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, cystic medial degeneration, or other condition causing the
             ascending aorta to be irregular in geometry or physiology as seen via preoperative
             imaging.

          -  Patient is participating in concomitant research studies of investigational products.

          -  Patient will not agree to return to the implant center for the required number of
             follow-up visits or is geographically unavailable for follow-up.
