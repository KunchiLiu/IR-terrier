  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to enroll 60 healthy, non-pregnant premenopausal women age 18-45 who do not have hot
      flashes (in order to have 30 women complete all study procedures) in a trial investigating
      the impact of hot flashes developed in response to an injection of a GnRH agonist,
      leuprolide (brand name: Lupron) on sleep disruption and mood. This study is designed to
      mimic the menopause transition. Based on previous studies, we expect that 2/3 of the women
      will develop hot flashes, naturally dividing participants into two groups: + hot flashes and
      no hot flashes. We will collect data on sleep disruption and mood changes to compare
      differences between the + hot flashes group and the group of women who do not develop hot
      flashes on leuprolide.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the effects of hot flashes on sleep using a model of induced
      hot flashes in pre-menopausal women.

      Hypothesis 1a: Hot flashes worsen objectively measured sleep

      Hypothesis 1b: Exposure to hot flashes leads to the perception of poor sleep quality

      Specific Aim 2: To identify the relative effects of hot flashes and sleep disruption on mood
      using a model of induced hot flashes in premenopausal women.

      Hypothesis 2a: Objectively measured sleep disturbance has a greater effect than hot flashes
      on mood

      Hypothesis 2b: Perception of poor sleep correlates with negative mood

      Exploratory Aim: To establish the feasibility of identifying specific genetic polymorphisms
      for genes involved in the estrogen pathway and the development of hot flashes.

    <description>Leuprolide acetate 3.75-mg intramuscular injection
Leuprolide is a widely used GnRH agonist. Leuprolide is indicated for treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, precocious puberty, and prostate cancer, and is used off-label for in-vitro fertilization and premenstrual syndrome. In this protocol, leuprolide will be administered at a dose routinely used for treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids in women.
Leuprolide can induce amenorrhea for 2-3 months after a depot injection is given. However, unpredictable menstrual bleeding and spotting can occur during this time period. Menstrual-cycle patterns will be monitored closely during the study. Although long-term administration of any GnRH agonist (i.e., &gt;6 months) is associated with bone loss, bone effects are not expected in this protocol because GnRH agonist therapy will be used for only one month.</description>
