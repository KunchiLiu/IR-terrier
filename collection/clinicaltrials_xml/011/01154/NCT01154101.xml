  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be conducted at 5 study centers in the
      United States. Approximately 30 subjects with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis will
      take part. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 21 days, a 12-week
      treatment period with 7 on-treatment clinic visits (approximately one every 2 weeks) and a
      post-dosing follow-up clinic visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug
      is taken.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either 250mg, 500mg or 1000mg of study drug or
      placebo. Study drug will be taken by mouth on a full stomach, every day for 84 days.

      Vital signs, clinical laboratory results (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), ECGs and
      physical examinations will be assessed at periodic intervals from Day 1 through Day 84.

      A skin biopsy will be taken at the beginning and the end of the dosing period to evaluate
      any effects of the study drug on psoriasis. Investigators will perform other psoriasis
      evaluations (including the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] and the Physician's
      Global Assessment [PGA] at 5 different times throughout the study to quantify the effects of
      SRT2104 on psoriasis activity.

      Subjects will complete questionnaires throughout the study, to document their sense of
      well-being and mood at 4 different times during the study.

      Five blood samples will be obtained at different timepoints during the study, to measure the
      amount of SRT2104 in the body.
