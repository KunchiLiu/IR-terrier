    <textblock>
      Asthma is an extremely common disorder, which is becoming more prevalent. The purpose of
      this study is to examine how nocturnal lung volumes contribute to asthma severity, which may
      explain part of the link between asthma and obesity. The investigators seek to test the
      hypothesis that raising lung volumes during the night will improve asthma symptoms. The
      investigators work may lead to new targets for therapy.

    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway inflammation and airway
      hyperresponsiveness, which causes airflow obstruction. It is extremely prevalent, affecting
      an estimated 22 million Americans, and costly with loss of productivity and direct
      healthcare costs in the billions of dollars. The incidence and prevalence of asthma are
      increasing, both in the US and around the world. This increase comes despite greater
      understanding of the inflammatory and allergic basis for asthma, and despite better
      antiinflammatory medications. One explanation for the increasing prevalence of asthma is the
      concomitant increase in obesity, with the majority of Americans now overweight or obese.
      Numerous studies have convincingly linked asthma and obesity, and demonstrated increased
      obstruction with weight gain and decreased obstruction with weight loss. However, the
      mechanisms that underlie this linkage are not known.

      We believe that low lung volumes contribute to the pathogenesis and severity of asthma.
      End-expiratory lung volume is decreased in obesity, and likely falls further during sleep,
      particularly in overweight and obese patients. Both upper and lower airway resistance
      increase with decreasing lung volumes, as airways become smaller. However, prior work has
      shown that lower airway resistance increases out of proportion to the decrease in lung
      volume that occurs during sleep in asthma patients. This difference between controls and
      people with asthma has not been further explored, yet may provide insight into asthma
      pathogenesis and provide potential targets for therapy.

      Therefore, we propose a series of experiments to define the impact of lung volumes during
      sleep on airway resistance. One of these experiments will be to to test the hypothesis that
      lung stretch can be used therapeutically by tonically and dynamically increasing lung
      volumes during sleep using bi-level positive airway pressure. This research can help
      delineate asthma pathogenesis and may help improve therapeutic options in this exceedingly
      common disease.

    <measure>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) consists of 32 questions answered by subjects focused on asthma symptoms and ability to carry on activities of daily living. It is well validated, and frequently used in large clinical asthma studies as a primary endpoint. Changes of +/- 0.5 on this scale are considered clinically relevant.</description>

    <measure>Airway reactivity as measured by Methacholine Challenge.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 4 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This is a physiological measurement derived from repeated breathing maneuvers which measures airway reactivity. Subjects are exposed to higher and higher concentrations of an airway irritant (in this case methacholine), and between each dose perform spirometry. The test is stopped after the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) falls 20% below the baseline. The concentration of methacholine at which this occurs is called the PC20. Methacholine challenges are routinely used in the diagnosis of asthma, and in many asthma research studies to measure changes in airway reactivity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  mild to moderate asthma, diagnosed by a physician, OR

          -  mild to moderate asthma and CPAP treated OSA. Must be compliant with CPAP therapy
             (greater than 4 hours per night, at least 4 nights/week)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  lung disease other than asthma or OSA

          -  medications known to affect respiratory function (apart from asthma and rhinitis
             therapy)

          -  abnormal nasal anatomy

          -  current smokers and ex-smokers (quit within the last 3 months, or &gt;10 pack-years)

          -  pregnant women - women of child bearing age will undergo a urine pregnancy test
             before enrollment and during the course of the study, as some of the study procedures
             cannot be performed during pregnancy and because pregnancy often changes asthma
             symptoms and severity.

          -  severe asthma - defined as a recent exacerbation (doctor or ER visit for asthma, or
             oral steroid use, within the previous 4 weeks) or frequent exacerbations (&gt;4
             exacerbations in the last year.

          -  severe obstructive sleep apnea requiring supplemental oxygen in addition to CPAP
             therapy.

          -  the regular use of prescription (e.g. zolpidem) or over-the-counter sleep aids (e.g.
             Benadryl).

          -  Central sleep apnea
