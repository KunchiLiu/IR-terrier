    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control at Week 12 Based on IRR</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 12 weeks is defined as the percent of participants with CR, PR or stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks according to RECIST version 1.1 as determined by the IRR. The best response of SD can be assigned if SD criteria were met at least once after randomization at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease.

      <recruitment_details>This phase 3, randomized, open label, multicenter study conducted at 169 centers in 31 countries. A total of 343 participants were randomized, 172 in crizotinib arm and 171 in chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin) arm. Date of first randomization was 13 January 2011. This study is ongoing at data cut off 30 November 2013.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic non squamous non small cell lung cancer and tumors with measurable disease were enrolled. Participants were to be positive for translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene locus as determined by an ALK break‑apart FISH test.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Disease Control Rate (DCR) at 12 weeks is defined as the percent of participants with CR, PR or stable disease (SD) at 12 weeks according to RECIST version 1.1 as determined by the IRR. The best response of SD can be assigned if SD criteria were met at least once after randomization at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease.

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study treatment in a participant who received study treatment. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs were to be collected from first dose until 28 days after the last dose of study medication. SAEs could be collected after this timeframe if considered to be treatment related.

          <description>A mandatory tumor sample (archived or fresh) was required at screening for detecting ALK gene fusion events in order to determine the eligibility of participants to enter the study. The Vysis ALK Break Apart Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) test was used as the primary assay. Only those participants whose tissue sample was positive for the ALK gene fusion by FISH testing by the central laboratory were allowed to enter the study. Testing for ALK gene fusion variants was performed using the Response Genetics, Inc. Echinoderm Microtubule Associated Protein Like 4 (EML4) ALK reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) gene fusion test. Percentage of participant with complete or partial response was according to RECIST version 1.1 by type of ALK gene fusion variant.</description>
          <population>The ALK gene fusion variant evaluable population was defined as participants from the FA population who had a result from ALK gene fusion variant testing of either no rearrangement, or 1 of 9 results reflecting 8 specific rearrangements (V1, V2, V3a, V3b, V3a/b, V4, V5a, V6, and V7).</population>

        <title>Time to Deterioration (TTD) in Pain in Chest, Dyspnea, or Cough</title>
        <description>TTD in pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough from the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-LC13) was a composite endpoint defined as the time from randomization to the earliest time the participant’s scale scores showed a 10 point or greater increase after baseline in any of the 3 symptoms. For those who had not shown deterioration, the data was censored at the last date when the participants completed an assessment (QLQ-LC13) for pain, dyspnea, or cough or at last visit date prior to crossover for participants randomized to chemotherapy who subsequently crossed over to crizotinib. A 10-point or higher change in the score was perceived by participants as clinically significant. The median TTD mentioned in below table was based on Brookmeyer and Crowley method.</description>

Scale score range: 0 to 100. Higher symptom score = greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a validated and reliable self-report preference-based measure developed by the EuroQoL Group to assess health-related quality of life. It consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and a visual analogue scale-the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system measures a participants' health state on 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels, reflecting “no health problems,” “moderate health problems,” and “extreme health problems.” The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self-rated health on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>
