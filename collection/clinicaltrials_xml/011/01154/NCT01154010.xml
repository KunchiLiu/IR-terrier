    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a medical device (ActiPatch) that emits a low
      frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) will benefit patients with anterior uveitis.
      Anterior uveitis (aka iritis) is an inflammatory disease involving the front segment of the
      eye. This is a common cause of a painful red eye, and ActiPatch has been shown to be
      effective in treating tissue inflammation. The conventional treatment of iritis typically
      involves frequent administration of topical steroids which have their own inherent risks
      (development of cataracts and/or glaucoma). The purpose of this study is to determine if
      ActiPatch therapy can be used to shorten the length of time and/or quantity of steroids
      administered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iritis is an inflammatory disease focused in the anterior chamber of the eye. The
      inflammation inside the eye can lead to a number of conditions that ultimately effect
      vision. These can include glaucoma, posterior synechiae, cystoid macular edema, and
      cataract. The standard treatment for the disease is drug therapy centered around the
      administration of corticosteroids. These are administered in the form of eye drops, and if
      necessary periocular/intraocular injections, or/and by systemic oral/IV administration.
      Unfortunately, the treatment with corticosteroids can similarly induce severe side effects
      including glaucoma and cataract formation. ActiPatch is a medical device that emits a low
      frequency pulsed electromagnetic field. This device has been shown to reduce inflammation
      and pain in a number of conditions, eg blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery). ActiPatch is FDA
      approved for use after blepharoplasty to reduce swelling, inflammation and pain. The
      treatment is not invasive, does not require additional medication, and side effects from
      ActiPatch and other PEMF devices have not been reported. The potential benefit of treating
      uveitis with ActiPatch is the potential to reduce the time and/or amount of steroid
      administration. This would benefit patients by reducing the risk of unwanted side effects of
      the corticosteroid treatment.

      The benefit to society would be an improved treatment for anterior uveitis.

    <description>Degree and grade of ocular inflammation based on Standard Uveitis Nomenclature will be assessed at initial visit, Day 3, and Day 7 of use of the PEMF device to assess if the PEMF device decreases the duration and severity of ocular inflammation when used as an adjunctive therapy for anterior uveitis.</description>

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to rate their pain and redness daily from the initial visit until the end of the study and use of the PEMF device at Day 7. This data will allow us to assess if subjectively, patients report improvement in pain with the active Actipatch devices compared to placebo devices when used with standard therapy for anterior uveitis.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Human subjects who have been clinically diagnosed with anterior uveitis (iritis) but
             are in otherwise in good health will be recruited for the study. The age requirement
             will be a minimum of 18 yrs. We will recruit 24 patient for this study. Subjects will
             only be included who have been clinically diagnosed with anterior uveitis
             (noninfectious). Eligibility will be determined by the treating Ophthalmologist
             (principal investigator) for inclusion in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vulnerable subjects, as defined by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), will not be
             recruited for participation (This includes individuals under 18, pregnant women,
             prisoners, fetuses, patients mentally or physically unable to provide written
             informed consent).

          -  Other groups excluded include: patients with pacemakers and patients with
             ferromagnetic metal implants since these devices may be effected by the pulsed
             electromagnetic field.
