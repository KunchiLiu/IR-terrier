  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying the side effects of and how well alisertib works in treating
      young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or leukemia. Alisertib may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the objective response rate to MLN8237 (alisertib) in children with relapsed
      or refractory solid tumors and leukemias, administered once daily for 7 days every 21 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further define and describe the toxicities of MLN8237 administered on this schedule.

      II. To further characterize the pharmacokinetics of MLN8237 in children with refractory
      cancer.

      III. To evaluate aurora A kinase expression using immunohistochemistry in solid tumors and
      leukemic blasts from tissue obtained at diagnosis and, if available, at relapse.

      IV. To explore the relationship between polymorphic variations in the
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene UGT1A1 and exposure to MLN8237, and to assess 2 common
      polymorphic variants in the aurora A kinase gene, Phe31Ile and Val57Ile.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to type of tumor
      (measurable neuroblastoma vs neuroblastoma with metaiodobenzylguanidine [MIBG]-positive
      lesions vs osteosarcoma vs Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor [PNET] vs
      rhabdosarcoma vs non-rhabdomyosarcoma [RMS] soft tissue sarcoma vs hepatoblastoma vs
      malignant germ cell tumor vs Wilms tumor vs acute myeloid leukemia [AML] vs acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] vs rhabdoid tumors).

      every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      or unacceptable toxicity.

      21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM X (ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA): Patients receive alisertib PO QD on days 1-7.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM XI (ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA): Patients receive alisertib PO QD on days 1-7. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM XII (RHABDOID MALIGNANCY): Patients receive alisertib PO QD on days 1-7. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Plasma samples are collected from all patients at baseline and periodically during course 1
      for pharmacokinetic and other studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 5 years.
