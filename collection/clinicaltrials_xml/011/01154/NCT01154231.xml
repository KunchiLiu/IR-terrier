      Patients with hemophilia B (congenital blood coagulation factor IX deficiency) who are
      administered this drug.

      Patients with hemophilia B are either patients for whom treatment was already started with a
      blood coagulation factor IX product (&quot;Previously treated patients&quot;: hereinafter, &quot;PTPs&quot;) or
      patients who have no history of treatment with a blood coagulation factor IX product in the
      past and for whom treatment will be started with this drug for the first time (&quot;Previously
      untreated patients&quot;: hereinafter, &quot;PUPs&quot;).

      The definition of PUPs in this survey is &quot;Patients in whom the total number of days of
      administration of a blood coagulation factor IX product other than this drug before
      administration of this drug was 3 exposure days (actual number of days of administration:
      hereinafter, &quot;EDs&quot;) or less.&quot;
