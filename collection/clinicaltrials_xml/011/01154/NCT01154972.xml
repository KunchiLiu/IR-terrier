    <textblock>
      When a person has breast cancer it is necessary to find out whether the cancer has spread to
      the lymph nodes in the armpit because if it has, further treatment is likely to be needed.
      There are many of these nodes but when the breast cancer spreads, it does so in a
      step-by-step fashion, starting with the so-called Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN). At present, the
      only way to be sure whether there is cancer in the lymph nodes or not is to perform an
      operation to remove at least the SLN. If the pathologist finds cancer in the SLN, a second
      operation is usually required to remove further nodes in case they contain cancer too.
      Surgical removal of the lymph nodes in the armpit can cause difficulties for the patient
      afterwards, such as pain and swelling in the arm. If there is no cancer in the SLN, no
      further operations on the armpit are needed. The investigators wish to find out whether in
      some patients, operations on the armpit can be avoided completely. The first step in doing
      this is to test whether the investigators can find out which is the SLN before the
      operation, using a combination of an injection and ultrasound scanning. The injection - into
      the skin of the breast - would be a radioactive substance, which is the usual way the
      surgeon finds the SLN. The radioactive substance collects in the SLN and the investigators
      would use a &quot;gamma probe&quot; over the surface of the armpit to detect the radiation. In this
      initial study, the investigators would aim to find the SLN before the operation and place a
      marker wire in it so that the surgeon could check whether the investigators had found the
      correct node.
