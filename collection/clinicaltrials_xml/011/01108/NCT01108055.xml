  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will combine an oral investigational VEGF inhibitor called papopanib which is being
      studied in kidney cancer will be combined with standard chemotherapy called taxol in
      patients with relapsed recurrent urothelial cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the results from the Phase 1 study of pazopanib combined with paclitaxel and the
      activity of paclitaxel in urothelial cancer, testing this regimen in a disease where there
      is an unmet need appears appropriate.
