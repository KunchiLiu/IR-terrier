      This is a pilot study of up to 10 patients with Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG)
      from the Old Order Mennonite community, who will be given lithium for 6 months and have dual
      energy xray absorptiometry (DXA), peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT) and
      lab assessment at baseline and 6 months. Studies in the mouse model of OPPG showed that
      lithium normalized their bone strength. Controls (n=20) will be recruited from the Old Order
      Mennonite community, to minimize the effects of environmental and lifestyle factors. The
      controls will not be given lithium. The age range of participants will be 4-64 years.

    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma (OPPG) syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder (approximately 50
      cases have been reported worldwide) due to mutations in the LRP5 gene, causing blindness
      from birth and fragile bones (osteoporosis)in early childhood. The bony fragility can lead
      to recurrent fractures of major bones such as the hip (femur) and spine, leaving some
      children in wheelchairs.

      Treatment to strengthen the bones in OPPG has primarily been with osteoporosis medications
      used in other fragile bone disorders of childhood and in adults, namely the bisphosphonates
      (eg. pamidronate, alendronate). These drugs have helped the bone strength in OPPG somewhat
      but have not prevented all fractures. We have observed fractures of the hip in 3 children
      with OPPG who we have treated, in spite of their attaining normal bone density (determined
      by DXA, dual xray absorptiometry) with bisphosphonates. Therefore, new treatments for OPPG
      are greatly needed and new methods besides DXA are needed to monitor bone strength on
      treatment.

      A mouse model of OPPG has been created. In the mouse model of OPPG, lithium dramatically
      improved their bones, returning them to normal strength and preventing fractures. Lithium,
      which is used for people with psychiatric disease, is known to lead to higher bone strength
      and reduced fractures in people who are on it for psychiatric disease. Lithium has been used
      safely and is approved for children 12 and above. The theory is that lithium will improve
      bone strength in OPPG in humans, as it has in the mouse, by stimulating bone production
      bypassing the genetic defect in OPPG.

      In this study, we plan to treat up to 10 patients with OPPG with lithium for 6 months,
      monitoring the response of the bones by both DXA and pQCT (peripheral quantitative computed
      tomography), the latter which gives information about bone quality. An IND has been obtained
      to use lithium in this study.
