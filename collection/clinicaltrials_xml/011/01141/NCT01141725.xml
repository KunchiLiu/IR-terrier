    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bendamustine
      hydrochloride when given together with idarubicin in treating older patients with previously
      untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride or idarubicin, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that is associated with a complete remission (CR) rate
      of at least 40%, and a rate of grade 3-4 extramedullary toxicity &lt; 30% in patients aged 50
      or older with previously untreated AML or high-risk MDS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) after therapy at each level of
      the dosing strategy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bendamustine hydrochloride followed by
      a phase II study.

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on days 1-5 and idarubicin IV
      on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually thereafter for 3 years.
