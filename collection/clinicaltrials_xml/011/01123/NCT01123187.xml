  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center phase 2 clinical trial, is designed for confirming the efficacy and
      safety of sequential islet allotransplantation with steroid free immunosuppression in
      patients with previous kidney transplantation.

    <textblock>
      The beneficial effects of glycemic control on both survival and function of transplanted
      kidneys in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus have been recognized.

      The purpose of this study is to reverse hyperglycemia and insulin dependency, by islet cell
      transplantation, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who have a stable kidney
      allograft.

      The study primary efficacy endpoint is graft survival defined as insulin independence and
      HbA1c &lt; 6.5% at 1 year post first transplant. Secondary outcomes are graft function and
      metabolic control

      The immunosuppression protocol for the kidney graft was converted to sirolimus+tacrolimus
      regimen 6 months before islet transplantation to exclude negative effects on kidney graft
      function.

    <description>Islet transplantation consisted of up to three sequential fresh islet infusions within three months. Access to the portal vein was gained under general anesthesia by percutaneous catheterisation of a peripheral portal branch under ultrasound guidance or by surgical catheterisation of a small mesenteric vein.</description>
