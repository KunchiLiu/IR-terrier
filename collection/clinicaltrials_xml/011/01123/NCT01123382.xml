    <textblock>
      Post-stroke shoulder pain is a major rehabilitation problem affecting moderate to severely
      impaired stroke survivors. Surface electrical stimulation (ES) of muscles surrounding the
      hemiparetic shoulder has been demonstrated to be beneficial, but despite the evidence for
      therapeutic benefit, the clinical implementation of surface ES for poststroke shoulder pain
      has been difficult. In order to address the limitations of surface ES, the investigative
      team pioneered the development of percutaneous intramuscular (IM) ES for the treatment of
      post-stroke shoulder pain. However, prior to acceptance by the clinical community,
      additional gaps in the scientific and clinical knowledge need to be addressed. This study
      begins to do so. The primary objective is to estimate the relative pain reduction associated
      with IM ES vs. &quot;usual care.&quot; We hypothesize that the IM ES group will exhibit a larger
      effect size with respect to pain reduction compared to &quot;usual care&quot;. A secondary objective
      is to estimate the effect on health related QOL of IM ES vs. &quot;usual care.&quot; Demonstration of
      improvement in QOL will validate the clinical relevance of the intervention. We hypothesize
      that the IM ES group will exhibit greater improvement in health related QOL compared to
      &quot;usual care&quot;.

    <description>A sterile percutaneous IM electrode is implanted in the shoulder using a 20-gauge hypodermic needle and connected to an external cable. The exit site and electrode are covered by a bandage, but the cable extends out. After a one week stabilization period, the cable is connected to a stimulator. A self-adhesive surface electrode serves as the indifferent electrode. Stimulation intensity is set by the investigator. The prescription for daily stimulation treatment will be 6 hrs. The duty cycle and daily dose will remain constant throughout the treatment, but stimulus parameters may be adjusted by the research staff as deemed appropriate. The treatment period will be 3 weeks, after which the electrode will be removed. Total time of electrode implantation is no more than 29 days.</description>
