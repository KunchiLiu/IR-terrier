  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hope to find safer, noninvasive methods for measuring tumor hypoxia. Hypoxia, meaning a
      lack of oxygen, has been associated strongly with a wide range of human cancers. Hypoxia
      occurs when tumor growth exceeds the ability of blood vessels to supply the tumor with
      oxygenated blood. It is currently understood that hypoxic tumors are more aggressive.
      Current methods for measuring hypoxia include invasive procedures such as tissue biopsy, or
      insertion of an electrode into the tumor. EF5-PET may be a non-invasive way to make this
      measurement.

      To establish PET imaging with the tracer FMISO as an accurate and reliable method for
      measuring the oxygen content of a tumor and to establish the measurement of secreted markers
      in blood as an accurate and reliable method for measuring the oxygen content of a tumor.

        Any solid tumor malignancies of any stage meeting all of the following criteria: 1. Tumor
        is accessible for minimally invasive biopsy (i.e., not requiring general anesthesia; e.g.,
        FNA, core needle, punch, excision under local anesthesia) OR surgical resection is the
        planned initial treatment regardless of participation in this study; 2. Minimum tumor
        dimension is at least 1 cm (to ensure it is above the detection threshold of PET imaging).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        3.1.1 Eligible Diseases

        Any solid tumor malignancies of any stage meeting all of the following criteria: Minimum
        tumor dimension is at least 1 cm (to ensure it is above the detection threshold of PET
        imaging).

        Examples include but are not limited to: locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the
        head and neck to be treated by either initial surgery or primary chemoradiotherapy;
        inoperable non-small cell lung cancer or pancreatic carcinoma to be treated with
        stereotactic radiotherapy, which may be biopsied again at the time of percutaneous needle
        delivery of implanted fiducial markers.

        3.1.2 Allowable type and amount of prior therapy: Patients with newly diagnosed
        malignancies should not have initiated treatment for their disease before participating in
        this study. Patients with recurrent or second malignancies may have had prior therapy as
        appropriate for their disease, but should have completed all prior treatment at least 30
        days before participation in this study and should not have initiated new treatment for
        the current problem.

        3.1.4 Patients must be greater than or equal to eighteen years of age.

        3.1.5 ECOG or Karnofsky Performance Status will not be employed, but patients will need to
        be sufficiently healthy to tolerate all study procedures.

        3.1.6 Requirements for organ and marrow function are not applicable to this study, but
        function will need to be sufficient to undergo planned therapy.

        3.1.7 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
        document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Pregnant or nursing patients will be excluded from the study.
