  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a Phase 1b portion aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and
      the safety profile of PF-03084014 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel
      followed by a Phase 2 portion to evaluate the efficacy of the triple combination in terms of
      overall survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma not previously
      treated with anticancer therapies.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated on 24JUN15 due to change in strategy of PF-03084014 development.No
    safety/efficacy concerns were behind the reason of trial termination

    <description>BPI-sf is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions. BPI-sf are 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, right now) and 7 questions that assess impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each question is answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 10; '0=No pain and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine'. Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</description>
