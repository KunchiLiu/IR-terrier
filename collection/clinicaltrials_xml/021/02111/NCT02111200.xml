  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study and compare how effectively sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium
      benzoate, and a combination of the two, help excrete nitrogen in healthy volunteers. Subject
      participation will require three, separate, four-day study periods at least one week apart.
      During one study period (also called a treatment arm), subjects will take sodium
      phenylbutyrate; during another they will take sodium benzoate; during another they will take
      a combination of the two medications.

      We expect to find that phenylbutyrate is more effective at removing nitrogen than benzoate
      or a combination of the two.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with (a) a history of frequent dietary protein intolerance, (b) a history of
             chronic or acute liver diseases which may result in altered hepatic synthetic
             capacity (e.g., hepatitis), (c) acute or chronic disease or on medications that in
             the opinion of the clinical investigators will interfere with the measurements (e.g.,
             drugs which may have hepatotoxicity as potential side effects), (d) a physical
             disability that will interfere with their ability to either conform to the dietary
             regimes or undergo the isotopic infusions, (e) pregnancy or recent (&lt;6
             months)/current lactation, (f) intercurrent evidence of significant hyperammonemia
             (more than 100 Âµmol/L), (g) any clinical abnormality of Grade 3 or greater according
             to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0 (CTCAE), (h) any
             condition(s) not covered by the CTCAE, or (i) a severe or life-threatening toxicity
             at screening, will be excluded from the study. Subjects taking ammonia scavenger
             medications will not be enrolled.
