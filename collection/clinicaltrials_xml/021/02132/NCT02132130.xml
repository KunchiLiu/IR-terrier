  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the potential ability of
      CGF166 delivered through IL-infusion to improve hearing and vestibular function. CGF166 is a
      recombinant adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector containing a cDNA encoding the human Atonal
      transcription factor (Hath1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of CGF166 and the
      associated delivery procedures in patients with severe-to-profound bilateral hearing loss.
      Eligible patients are required to have documented, non-fluctuating hearing loss. Part A will
      include a safety and tolerability cohort (N=3). Patient dosing will be staggered; dosing the
      next patient in a cohort will be based on a safety review of all available data through 4
      weeks post-dose of the previously dosed patient(s). Part B includes a volumetric escalation
      design to evaluate infusion volumes of the same CGF166 concentration (5.0 x 10E11vp/mL) in 4
      cohorts of patients (n=3/cohort; total of 12 patients). Part C is an expansion cohort of the
      highest safe and tolerable dose identified in Part B, for further assessment of efficacy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        For all Parts A, B and C of the study,

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          2. For all Parts (A, B and C) of the study, male or female patients, 18 to 75 years old,
             inclusive, with severe-to-profound bilateral hearing loss with intact vestibular
             function in the non operative ear. Non-fluctuating severe-to-profound hearing loss is
             required for the study ear and is defined as:

               -  PTA within 10 dB of the PTA obtained at least 11 months previously.

               -  Word recognition within 20% of previous test at least 11 months previously [AAO
                  HNS Hearing Classification System]

          3. Candidate ear (&quot;study ear&quot;): Minimal residual hearing based on the pure tone average
             of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz thresholds of ≤110 dB HL

          4. Candidate ear (&quot;study ear&quot;): Pure tone audiometric thresholds of ≥50 dB HL for each
             testable octave frequency of 0.125 and 0.250 kHz, ≥ 70 dB HL for each testable octave
             frequency from 0.5 through 8 kHz and sentence recognition scores ≤50% at screening.
             Subject responses will be monitored for vibrotactile sensation, particularly for the
             low-frequency stimuli (e.g., 125 and 250 Hz). A frequency that elicits vibrotactile
             responses at levels below 70 dB HL will be considered &quot;not testable&quot; for hearing
             threshold and only those frequencies that are testable for hearing threshold will be
             considered for patient inclusion/exclusion in the study.

          5. Contralateral ear (&quot;non-study ear&quot;): Despite use of a hearing aid, must meet cochlear
             implantation criteria. Pure tone average over 0.5/1/2/4 kHz of ≥70 dB HL and ≤110 dB
             HL and sentence recognition using the AzBio test ≤60% at screening

          6. Patients with intact vestibular function in at least one ear (non-study ear) as
             measured by vestibulo-ocular reflex, caloric nystagmography, or vestibular evoked
             myogenic potential (VEMP)

          7. Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study

          8. Meet surgical requirements/eligibility (including MRI scan within 3 months or at
             screening to confirm suitability for inner ear surgery)

          9. Patients must weigh at least 40 kg to participate in the study, and must have a body
             mass index (BMI) &lt;45 kg/m2. BMI = Body weight (kg) / [Height (m)]2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with hearing loss caused by genetic/developmental disorders, e.g., cochlea
             aplasia or autoimmune ear disease

          2. Patients with existing conductive hearing loss or mixed hearing loss as judged by the
             Principal Investigator following a thorough review of all of the trial hearing
             assessments, especially immittance testing as part of DPAOE;

          3. Patients with cochlear implants or past cochlear implant in the candidate study ear

          4. Hearing loss due to any other cause that would not be expected to respond to hair
             cell regeneration, for example mechanical trauma or central auditory lesions or lack
             of an auditory nerve

          5. Patients who will require ototoxic drugs as routine therapy over the course of the
             study, such as oncology patients on platinum-based chemotherapy

          6. Any contraindication to the planned surgery or anesthesia as determined by the
             surgeon or anesthesiologist

          7. Previous surgery in the study ear

          8. Any otological history, such as chronic otitis, cholesteatoma, tympanic membrane
             perforation, that suggests poor candidacy for cochlear implant or inner ear surgery
             or suggests potential interference with study auditory or vestibular function tests

          9. Pregnant women

         10. Abnormal vital signs and/or ECG that suggest potential contraindication for planned
             study anesthesia

         11. Past serious adverse reaction to anesthesia

         12. Meniere's Disease

         13. History of radiation therapy to the head and neck

         14. Participation in a clinical trial within the last 30 days

         15. Immunocompromised patients, as judged by the investigators based on patient history,
             physical exam and CBC
