  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and duration of bupivacaine
      extended-release liposome injection (Exparel) versus bupivacaine with dexamethasone in
      transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks for patients undergoing abdominal surgery at Emory
      University Hospital and Emory University Hospital Midtown.

      The investigators hypothesize that Exparel will provide greater postoperative pain relief
      than bupivacaine with dexamethasone. The investigators plan to enroll up to 50 male and
      female subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria who will be randomized to receive
      either Exparel (Group 1) or bupivacaine with epinephrine and dexamethasone (Group 2) in the
      TAP block to achieve at least 22 subjects in each group

      Group 1 will be administered 266 mg of Exparel, diluted to 30 mL. Group 2 will be given 28
      mL of 0.375% bupivacaine and 8mg/2 mL dexamethasone.Before injection of the study
      medication, 2mL of normal saline with be injected under ultrasound visualization to ensure
      needle tip is in the transversus abdominis plane.Randomization will occur following the
      written informed consent and prior to the start of the surgical procedure. Postoperatively,
      study patients will receive intravenous acetaminophen 1000mg every 8 hours for 3 doses, then
      oral acetaminophen 650mg every 6 hours. Subjects will also have patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA) with morphine or hydromorphone. The research staff recording data will be blinded to
      the treatment group. Demographic data will be recorded, including age, date of birth, height
      and weight to ensure similarity between the two groups. A medical history will be obtained
      as well as surgical and anesthesia details. Study patients will be followed for 72 hours
      postoperatively to record the amount of opioid consumption, as well as other pain score data
      using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).The subject's participation will end 72 hours after
      surgery. A telephone interview will occur with the subject if hospital discharge occurs
      prior to 72 hours.
