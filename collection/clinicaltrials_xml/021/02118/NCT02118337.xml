    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose expansion study of MEDI0680
      given alone and in combination with MEDI4736 to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic (PK), immunogenicity, and antitumor activity in adult subjects with select
      advanced malignancies.
