  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphomas have response rates of approximately
      30% to standard chemotherapy regimens. We alternatively hypothesize that MLN9708 will be
      active in this disease and will improve best objective response.

      We will also determine the extent to which MLN9708 inhibits GATA-3 (Trans-acting
      T-cell-specific transcription factor) expression, which is associated with poor prognosis,
      and whether GATA-3 expression represents a novel predictive biomarker for MLN9708
      sensitivity.

      Up to 25 patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into this
      trial in two stages. All enrolled patients will be treated with MLN9708 4 mg PO weekly (days
      1, 8, 15 every 28 days) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the initial
      stage of the study a total of 11 patients will be enrolled and treated with MLN9708. Should
      at least 4 patients exhibit a response (CR/CRu, PR), the second stage of 14 patients will
      open for enrollment. Efficacy will be assessed radiographically, by peripheral blood and
      bone marrow examination (when indicated), and physical exam every 8 weeks. Safety will be
      assessed by periodic physical exams, laboratory studies, and adverse events. All patients
      will have a follow-up visit 35 days (+/-7 days) following the last study drug treatment.
      Patients with accessible tumor tissue will be asked to undergo a biopsy for a fresh tissue
      sample for assessment of GATA-3 expression. Archived tissue samples from the initial
      diagnostic biopsy and the most recent lymphoma biopsy will be obtained in the event a fresh
      tumor biopsy cannot be obtained. Patients with GATA-3+ TCL and accessible tumor tissue will
      undergo a tumor biopsy at day 21 (+/- 7 days) of cycle 1. All baseline fresh or archived
      tissue will undergo central pathology review to confirm the diagnosis of TCL. The rationale
      for proteasome inhibition in T-cell lymphomas, based on the pre-clinical (and previous phase
      II) data, is compelling. Therefore, this phase II study will not be restricted to patients
      with GATA-3 expressing lymphomas.

    <description>Objective response is considered CR (Complete Response), CRu (Complete Response Unknown), or PR (Partial Response) and will be measured after every 2nd cycle of treatment until the 6th cycle, then every 3 months until 24 months, then every 6 months, all until disease progression or death. All patients receiving any MLN9708 therapy per protocol are considered evaluable for the primary endpoint; however, patients not able to receive at least 2-cycles of MLN9708 with an accompanying response assessment will be considered treatment failures.</description>
