      The primary hypotheses under test are that alcohol dependent subjects treated with
      fenofibrate will report decreased craving for alcohol following cue-exposure in the
      laboratory and report less drinking post treatment relative to placebo.

             interview, medical history, physical exam, ECG, urine test and lab tests

          -  Females with childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test on the
             screening visit with a negative urine pregnancy test at randomization and agree to

          -  Female subjects with childbearing potential who are pregnant, nursing, or refuse to

          -  Has a positive UDS at screening or Visit 3 (laboratory session)

          -  Treatment within the month prior to screening with an investigational drug, vaccine
