      Open-label, sequential dose escalation and expansion study of CPI-0610 in patients with
      previously treated Acute Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome,
      Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, and Myelofribrosis. CPI-0610 is a small

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (aged ≥ 18 years)

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following
             hematologic malignancies: AML, ALL, acute undifferentiated or biphenotypic leukemia,
             CML in blast crisis, MDS or MDS/MPN, and Myelofribrosis

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2.

          -  Adequate hematological, renal, hepatic, and coagulation laboratory assessments

          -  Patients must give written informed consent to participate in this study before the
             performance of any study-related procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed acute leukemia that has not been treated with a standard induction
             chemotherapeutic regimen or with another anti-leukemic agent

          -  Relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, where additional induction chemotherapy is
             considered to be of potential clinical benefit

          -  Acute leukemia in relapse less than 6 months following allogeneic stem cell
             transplantation

          -  CML in blast crisis and previously treated with only one bcr-abl TKI

          -  Very low or low risk MDS without previous treatment

             antibody and the first dose of CPI-0610 may be permitted in patients with rapidly
             progressive disease, following discussion with the medical monitor

          -  Treatment with an investigational small molecule less than 2 weeks before the first
             dose of CPI-0610. In addition, the first dose of CPI-0610 should not occur before a
             period equal to or greater than 5 half-lives of the small molecule investigational
             agent has elapsed

          -  Treatment with medications that are known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP450 enzymes

          -  Treatment with medications that are known to carry a risk of Torsades de Pointes

          -  Immunosuppressive treatment that cannot be discontinued both prior to study entry and
             for the duration of the study. Oral prednisone at a dose of 10 mg or less per day is
             allowed, as are other oral corticosteroids given at glucocorticoid-equivalent doses.
             Topical, nasal and inhaled corticosteroids are also allowed
