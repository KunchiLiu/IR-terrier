  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous leg ulcers (VLU) are the most common leg ulcer, can be painful, and limit work,
      lifestyles and activity, especially in older patients. There are few effective treatments -
      compression therapy (tight bandaging or stockings) helps healing, but about half the people
      with a VLU remain unhealed even after 12 weeks of treatment. Research suggests taking
      aspirin as well as using compression may speed up healing for VLU, but the current evidence
      is not enough to change clinical practice. We will conduct a randomised controlled trial to
      test whether using low dose aspirin (150 mg daily or placebo) really does speed up healing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pragmatic, community based, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial to
      determine whether low dose aspirin accelerates venous leg ulcer healing at 24 weeks when
      used in addition to compression. Participants in have compression therapy (system of choice
      guided by patient and/or clinical preference) as delivered through district nursing services
      at the study centres as a background treatment. Low dose aspirin (150 mg) or placebo will be
      taken once daily as an oral capsule.

      Participants will be district nursing service patients in five study centres in New Zealand
      with prevalent or incident venous leg ulcers. A venous leg ulcer will be defined as a wound
      on the lower leg that has remained unhealed for 4 or more weeks, appears to be primarily
      venous in aetiology with other causative diseases ruled out. If the participant has two or
      more venous leg ulcers, the largest ulcer will be the reference ulcer.

      Participants will receive three visits from the research nurse - visit 1 to screen for
      eligibility, visit 2 to consent and randomise the participant, visit 3 to collect outcome
      data. District nurses will continue to visit the participant (about weekly or more
      frequently if required) to provide routine care between research nurse visits.

      Block randomisation will be used, stratified by study centre and prognostic index (ulcer
      size greater than 5cm2 and ulcer duration greater than 6 months) to ensure a balance of
      participants within study centres and for participants likely to be slow healers. Research
      nurses in the study centres will contact a central telephone answering service, provide
      information on inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and relevant clinical history on
      consented participants. Randomised participants will receive a bottle of 168 capsules of
      study medication identified only by unique code and will take the capsule until the
      reference ulcer heals or up to 24 weeks, whichever occurs sooner.

      Participants will take the study medication for up to 24 weeks or until the reference ulcer
      heals. If the participant has a serious adverse event, needs to start taking aspirin, or
      must stop taking aspirin to use other medications, they will be withdrawn from treatment,
      although they will still be followed up at 24 weeks.
