  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undescended Testis is the most common congenital abnormality of the genitalia in boys and it
      is commonly managed by surgical intervention. Evidence in the medical literature to support
      the superiority of either scrotal or inguinal (standard) orchidopexy is lacking. To
      determine which technique is superior, this study focuses on the degree of post-operative
      pain after surgery. Therefore, the objective of this randomized control trial is to
      determine if scrotal orchidopexy reduces postoperative pain in children diagnosed with
      undescended testis when compared to standard inguinal orchidopexy.
