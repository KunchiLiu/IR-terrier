  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, prospective, multi-center, open-label study to assess the effectiveness
      and safety profile of epoetin beta (Recormon®) for treatment of symptomatic anemia in adult
      participants associated with low/intermediate-1-risk MDS. After screening, eligible
      participants will be treated with epoetin beta as recommended in the approved label and
      international guidelines for the use of epoetin in MDS participants and the dosage will be
      adjusted on the basis of erythroid response.
