    <textblock>
      This multicenter study in patients with HER2-positive eBC will investigate patients' pain
      and discomfort of subcutaneous (SC) trastuzumab (Herceptin) administered either via a
      single-use injection device (SID) or via vial for manual administration using a hand-held
      syringe (SC vial). In total, patients wil obtain at least 18 cycles/1 year of trastuzumab (4
      cycles of IV and 14 cycles of SC trastuzumab).
