    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to assess if a combination of medications can enhance the
      relief of superficial pain (pain at the surface of the skin, such as sunburn pain). The
      investigators also want to find out if certain genes may be linked to individual differences
      in experienced efficacy of pain killers. The combination of medications under investigation
      is diclofenac and atropine. Diclofenac has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat pain. Atropine has been approved by the FDA to treat certain
      types of poisoning, heartbeat problems, and other diseases but atropine is not approved to
      treat pain. However, atropine has been used for many years in different European countries
      to treat painful conditions such as stomach cramps.This research study will compare
      diclofenac and atropine to placebo.
