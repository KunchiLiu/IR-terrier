  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are diseases that share the same risk factors and
      routes of transmission. For this reason, many people infected with HIV are also infected
      with HCV. Interferon (IFN) is a drug used to treat HCV; however, in people coinfected with
      HIV and HCV, IFN treatment often does not work well and can cause unwanted side effects. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of IFN-free
      HCV treatment in HIV/HCV coinfected adults who are taking antiretroviral (ARV) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of a combination of
      drugs to treat HCV in adults who are coinfected with HIV and HCV. The three drugs are
      paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir (PTV/r/OBT), dasabuvir (DSV), and ribavirin (RBV). RBV
      will be given to participants with HCV genotype 1a only; participants with HCV genotype 1b
      will not receive RBV.

      This study will enroll HCV genotype 1a or 1b and HIV-1 coinfected participants (HCV
      treatment-na√Øve or HCV treatment-experienced) who are on a concurrent integrase inhibitor
      (INI)-based (raltegravir [RAL] or dolutegravir [DTG]) or protease inhibitor (PI)-based
      (darunavir [DRV] or atazanavir [ATV]) ART regimen. (The ART regimens will not be provided by
      the study.) The participants will be assigned to one of four cohorts (Cohorts A, B, C, and
      D). Participants in Cohorts A and B will be on INI-based ART; participants in Cohorts C and
      D, on PI-based ART. For each group, the study will proceed in two steps: Step 1: on-HCV
      treatment and Step 2: post-HCV treatment follow-up. Participants in Cohorts A and C will
      receive the HCV drugs for 24 weeks; participants in Cohorts B and D, for 12 weeks.

      Total study duration will be up to 48 weeks. During Step 1 (on-HCV treatment), all
      participants will have study visits at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Participants in Cohorts
      A and C will have additional Step 1 study visits at Weeks 16, 20, and 24.

      All participants will have Step 2 (post-treatment follow-up) study visits 4, 12, and 24
      weeks after registration to Step 2. Participants in Cohorts B and D will have an additional
      Step 2 visit 36 weeks after registration to Step 2.

      All study visits will include a brief physical exam and blood collection. Select study
      visits will include pregnancy testing for participants able to become pregnant, an
      electrocardiogram (EKG), an IFN gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) test, and collection of
      plasma samples.

      Some participants may take part in an optional substudy. Participants in the substudy will
      attend two study visits at entry/Day 0 and Week 4 for 12-hour intensive pharmacokinetic (PK)
      sampling.
