  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of angiomyolipomas is based on invasive techniques such as surgery or
      embolization. Development of anti-angiogenic therapies is a major and growing field of
      research in hypervascularized tumors. Angiomyolipomas have been shown to regress after
      prolonged treatment with mTOR inhibitors (Sirolimus), but with a large proportion of
      secondary effects. We showed recently that beta-blockers were able to induce regression of
      infantile hemagiomas. Consequently, we looked for and found, histologically, in a few cases
      of angiomyolipomas the presence of beta2 receptors.

      The aim of the study is to estimate if beta-blockers could induce regression or
      stabilization of renal angiomyolipomas in tuberous sclerosis in a pilot study.
