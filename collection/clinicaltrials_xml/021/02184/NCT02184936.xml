  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of acute ischemic stroke is aimed at salvaging viable but ischemic brain by
      opening the occluded artery and restoring anterograde perfusion as quickly as possible. Time
      saved while making critical decisions correctly is vital in acute ischemic stroke
      management. Conventional angiography is invasive, resource intensive and not feasible as a
      fast diagnostic tool. Perfusion CT and MRI are both susceptible to patient motion, need
      trained personnel to process and take at least 10-30 min to acquire and interpret. The
      investigators have developed a new imaging selection tool, multi-phase CT Angiography (CTA),
      which generates multiple time resolved images of backfilling arteries beyond a blocked
      artery filled by collaterals.

      The investigators seek to determine: i) if patients with acute ischemic stroke will have a
      differential clinical response to early recanalization based on collateral status assessed
      on multi-phase CTA, ii) if the extent to which collateral assessment on multi-phase CTA
      resembles perfusion CT in predicting which patients will have good clinical outcome with
      early recanalization, iii) Identify determinants of variability in native collateral status
      in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients with good and intermediate collaterals on
      multi-phase CTA achieve good clinical outcome with early recanalization (within 4 hours of
      baseline imaging); patients with poor collaterals do not do well even with early
      recanalization.

      Prove-IT is a prospective multi-center hospital-based cohort study of 500 consecutive
      patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within 12 hours of stroke symptom onset with
      evidence of intracranial occlusion on routine CTA over 3 years. Calgary and seven other
      comprehensive stroke centers will recruit patients into this study. Primary outcome is
      defined as a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 0 to 2 at 24 hours
      or an 8-point drop in NIHSS score from baseline to 24 hours. Secondary outcomes are a)
      90-day modified Rankin Score (mRS) 0-2 or equal to the pre-stroke mRS; b) percent neurologic
      improvement comparing NIHSS at baseline to 24 hours; c) 90-day NIHSS score 0-2; d) infarct
      volume on 24 hour imaging and e) parenchymal intracerebral hemorrhage type 1 and 2 (ECASS II
      criteria) at 24 hrs.

      Prove-IT looks to establish the ideal imaging selection tool for intra-arterial (IA) and
      thrombolysis decisions in the setting of acute ischemic stroke which is widely available,
      and can quickly and reliably detect salvageable brain.
