  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, the electronic medical record, microprocessor mechanical ventilators, and physiologic
      monitoring are under-utilized when translating research into decision support. Current
      medical informatic capabilities can be leveraged to calculate trends in measured parameters
      to initiate a paradigm shift in critical care from reaction-based treatment to proactive and
      plausibly preventative care. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop baseline
      understanding of our practice and how data collection utilizing a newly implemented system
      called T3. We would like to retrospectively review mechanically ventilated patients in which
      we have collected continuous data to test a newly developed analytic platform. Additionally
      we would like to compare these results to our standards of practice established by clinical
      practice guidelines.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient selection will be determined by available data collected in the T3 system. We
             estimate 50 patients in which mechanical ventilator data has been collected utilizing
             the limited intellibridge modules (4 systems currently available to collect
             ventilator data).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient not connected to T3 data collection system.
