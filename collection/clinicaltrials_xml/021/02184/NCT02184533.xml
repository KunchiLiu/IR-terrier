    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of sodium
      selenite when administered in combination with radiation therapy to subjects with metastatic
      cancer based on safety and tolerability.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sodium selenite when given in
           combination with palliative radiation therapy

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of sodium selenite and
           palliative radiation therapy in metastatic cancer

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics of sodium selenite

        -  To evaluate the anti tumor activity of sodium selenite and palliative radiation therapy
           when given in combination

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sodium selenite orally (PO) 2 hours before daily radiation therapy
      treatments. Treatment continues for the duration of the course of radiation therapy in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
