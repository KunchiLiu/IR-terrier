      1. Part A: Subjects will receive Patritumab or placebo with erlotinib. Progression-free
           survival will be the primary outcome. Subjects will need to have Epidermal Growth
           Factor Receptor (EGFR) wild-type, locally advance or metastatic NSCLC and have their
           cancer progressed after at least one prior systemic anti-cancer therapy, available
           recent or archival tumor specimen and may not have had previous EGFR-targeted regimen,
           anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2), anti-HER3, or anti-HER4 therapy.
           Subjects may have high heregulin or low heregulin.

        2. Part B: Subjects will receive Patritumab or placebo with erlotinib. Overall survival
           will be the primary outcome. Subjects will need to have EGFR wild-type, locally advance
           or metastatic NSCLC and have their cancer progressed after at least one prior systemic
           anti-cancer therapy, available recent or archival tumor specimen and may not have had
           previous EGFR-targeted regimen, anti-HER2, anti-HER3, or anti-HER4 therapy. Only
           subjects with high heregulin will be enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be greater or equal to 20 years of age

          2. Must have cytologically or histologically confirmed NSCLC with either:

               -  Metastatic disease (Stage IV) OR

               -  Stage IIIB disease not amenable to surgery or curative intent.

             Note: It is permissible to use either AJCC Version 6.0 or the AJCC Version 7.0
             staging system. For sites that use AJCC Version 7.0, T4M0 patients with other
             ipsilateral nodules and N0-N2 are still eligible.

          3. If tumor histology is adenocarcinoma, must have wild-type EGFR genotype as assessed
             by a validated assay that includes exon 19 deletion and exon 21 (L858R) substitution.

          4. Must have received one or two prior lines of systemic chemotherapy for advanced or
             metastatic disease, one of which must be a platinum-doublet therapy.

          5. Must have disease progression or recurrence documented by radiographic assessment
             following treatment after last chemotherapy or chemoradiation regimen (completed
             within the previous 12 months).

          6. Must have available recent (before treatment start) or archival tumor specimen.

          7. Must have measurable disease for Part A, measurable disease or non-measurable disease
             for Part B

          8. Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          9. Must have adequate hematological function

          4. History of other malignancies, except adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer,
             curatively treated in-situ disease, or other solid tumors curatively treated with no
             evidence of disease for greater or equal to 5 years

          5. History of corneal disease

          6. History of interstitial lung disease (ILD)

          7. Clinically active brain metastases

          8. Uncontrolled hypertension

             effusion requiring chronic medical intervention

         11. Myocardial infarction within 1 year before enrollment, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, unstable angina, or unstable cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication

         12. Treatment with anticancer therapy, antibody-based therapy, retinoid therapy, or
             hormonal therapy within 4 weeks before study drug treatment

         13. Therapeutic radiation therapy or major surgery within 4 weeks before study drug
             treatment; or palliative radiation within 2 weeks before study drug treatment

         14. Participation in clinical drug trials within 4 weeks

         15. Uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals, known
