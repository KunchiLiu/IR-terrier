  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative feasibility of 2 potential functional
      measures of target engagement (Glx MRS, BOLD fMRI) to systematically assess mGluR 2/3 in
      drug development for psychotic spectrum disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of healthy subject to assess the feasibility of Glx MRS and BOLD fMRI
      to measure ketamine induced changes in glutamatergic indices. The investigators will
      randomize 18 subjects at each site. Subjects will be randomized to ketamine or placebo in a
      2:1 ratio and receive two drug challenges separated by at least two weeks. Ketamine
      challenge is used to induce a &quot;glutamate surge&quot; within prefrontal brain regions that can be
      detected using neurochemical and functional imaging techniques. Each subject will receive
      MRS and BOLD fMRI during each challenge day. The goal of the pilot study is to assess the
      feasibility of both the proposed ketamine challenge paradigm and of the proposed
      imaging-based biomarkers. Specific indices to be used in assessing feasibility will include
      effect size, cross-site and cross-subject reliability, safety, and subject tolerability as
      similar studies will be performed independently at Yale and UC Davis. Second this
      information will be used to select and refine final study parameters for a subsequent full
      proof-of-clinical mechanism (POCM) study investigating the effect of Pomaglumetad on
      ketamine-induced MRS and fMRI effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-55

          -  Negative Urine Toxicology

          -  No present or past psychiatric conditions (including substance abuse or dependence,
             with the exception of nicotine dependence)

          -  No family history of schizophrenia in a first-degree relative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any current DSM IV Axis I disorder and/or past substance abuse of dependence
             (nicotine dependence is allowed)

          -  Any current use of amphetamines, opiates, cocaine, sedative-hypnotics, or cannabis
