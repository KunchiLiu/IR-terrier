    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary
      pharmacodynamics (proof of concept) of QBW251 in healthy subjects and cystic fibrosis
      patients following single and multiple doses. This first-in-human and proof of concept study
      will consist of 4 parts, with Parts 1 and 2 in healthy volunteers and Parts 3 and 4 in
      cystic fibrosis patients.
