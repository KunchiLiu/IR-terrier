  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 250,000 hip fractures in the US every year, and intertrochanteric
      (IT) fractures (fractures that occur just below the femoral head) account for nearly half of
      these fractures. The use of intramedullary (IM) nails for fixation of IT femur fractures has
      become a well-accepted and increasingly more common procedure among orthopaedic
      traumatologists, and is standard of care at our institution.

      While advancements in intramedullary nail fixation have made it a relatively efficient
      procedure, the placement of the lag screw into the femoral head still remains a challenging
      step in the procedure. Inaccurate placement can lead to screw cut-out, one of the most
      commonly reported complications with IM nail fixation. Previous work has shown that the lag
      screw position is an important factor in reducing screw cut-out. This step of the procedure
      can be time demanding and often requires several intraoperative radiographs for accurate
      placement. Recently developed computer-assisted navigation systems provide surgeons with the
      ability to track screw placement in real-time. This could allow for improved screw placement
      and potentially reduce radiation exposure to the patient and surgeon. To date, the potential
      advantages of computer-assisted navigation have not been examined.

      The primary objective of this study is to examine whether the use of Stryker's ADAPT
      computer-assisted navigation for Gamma nail fixation can result in improved lag screw
      placement. The secondary objective is to examine whether the use of the ADAPT for Gamma nail
      fixation can reduce intraoperative radiation exposure.Our hypothesis is that there is a
      difference in the lag screw placement (i.e. tip to apex distance measurement) between
      procedures using the ADAPT system versus the conventional technique for Gamma nail fixation.
      Additionally, we hypothesize that there is a difference in radiation exposure (i.e.
      fluoroscopy time) between procedures using the ADAPT system versus the conventional
      technique for Gamma nail fixation.
