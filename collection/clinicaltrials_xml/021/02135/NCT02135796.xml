  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that not all patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with
      a Central Venous Oxygen Saturation (ScvO2) less than 70% have cardiac dysfunction that would
      benefit from inotropic therapy (a key strategy in early goal directed therapy in patients
      with sepsis). Echocardiography might show that despite an adequate Central Venous Pressure
      (CVP), intravascular volume status is low and further volume expansion is warranted.
      Alternatively, echocardiography may indicate that left atrial pressure is elevated, and
      further intravascular volume resuscitation should be limited. Such observations may lead to
      a role for echocardiography within the parameters of the early goal-directed therapy
      protocol that may improve treatment of cardiac dysfunction and hypovolemia.

      The study objective is to correlate echocardiographic findings with objective parameters,
      namely central venous pressure (CVP) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), measured
      during the early resuscitation of critically ill patients with severe sepsis and septic
      shock.

      Aim #1: Correlate echocardiographic findings of right ventricular (RV) systolic function and
      dilation, left ventricular (LV) systolic function and dilation, and left ventricular
      diastolic function with CVP and ScvO2 in the early hours of resuscitation in patients with
      severe sepsis and septic shock.

      Aim #2: Evaluate the change in RV and LV dysfunction over time in patients with severe
      sepsis and septic shock and correlate with mortality.

      Aim #3: Evaluate the efficacy of bedside echocardiography performed by the intensivist in
      the ICU in the evaluation of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - at least 13 years of age

        SEPSIS PATIENTS:

        Sepsis patients must have

          1. Suspected or confirmed infection

             AND

          2. Organ dysfunction as defined by a SOFA &gt;= 2 above baseline (if no baseline data
             available, SOFA assumed to be 0)

        OR

        SEPTIC SHOCK PATIENTS:

        AFTER INFUSION OF 20ML/KG CRYSTALLOID OR EQUIVALENT, Septic shock patients must have

          1. Suspected or confirmed infection

             AND

          2. Lactate &gt; 2 mmol/L

             AND

          3. Receiving vasopressors

               -  Enrollment of patients should occur within 8 hours of meeting criteria for
                  severe sepsis or septic shock if it is required that a research only TTE be
                  performed in the 0-6 hours after ICU admission. If a clinical TTE is performed
                  in this timeframe, patients may be enrolled up to 24 hours after ICU admission.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  known pregnancy

          -  primary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome or

          -  major cardiac dysrhythmia such as:*

               -  Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach)

               -  Ventricular Fibrillation (V-fib)

               -  Third degree heart block (complete hear block or complete AV block)
