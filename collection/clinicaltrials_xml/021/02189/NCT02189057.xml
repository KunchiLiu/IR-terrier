    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this investigator-initiated trial is to evaluate the treatment outcome
      of depression utilizing platform algorithm products that can allow rapid identification of
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) genomic variation. This new technology may
      have the potential to optimize treatment selection by improving response, minimizing
      unfavorable adverse events / side effects and increasing treatment adherence.

      Treatment seeking depressed patients (SCID confirmed major depressive disorder or bipolar
      I/II disorder) to the Mayo Clinic Depression Center will be invited to participate in this
      study evaluating the Assurex GeneSight® platform; this new technology can rapidly assess PK
      and PD genetic variation that can potentially impact antidepressant, antipsychotic, and
      stimulant associated treatment outcomes for depression. This study will recruit treatment
      seeking patients with major depression with an index episode of moderate symptom severity
      that has been unresponsive or poorly tolerated to at least one prior antidepressant
      treatment. This will be an 8-week, double-blind trial where depressed patients are
      randomized to testing results of GeneSight® (tricolored clinical report) prior to treatment
      selection (n=138) vs. treatment as usual (tricolored dummy report) (n=138). All testing
      results will be made available after the 8-week trial.
