      The primary objective of this study is to assess the suitability of the autoinjector for
      self-administration of belimumab by subjects with SLE in real-life conditions. The study
      will assess the use of the autoinjector inside the clinic setting and outside the clinic
      setting. The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of belimumab administered
      subcutaneously (SC) via the autoinjector. Subjects will self-administer belimumab SC into
      the thigh or abdomen using the autoinjector device for 8 weekly doses. Subjects will return
      for a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the last SC dose of belimumab. All injections will be
      assessed by the investigators for success based on direct observation and/or the subject
      diary. A total of 118 subjects (treated with at least one dose of study drug) are planned to
      be enrolled in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged at least 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology
             (ACR) criteria.

          -  Active, autoantibody positive SLE, defined as the presence of anti nuclear antibody
             (ANA) or anti-double strand deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibodies (at screening or
             historically).

          -  Are on a SLE treatment regimen including intravenous (IV) belimumab every 28 days for
             at least three 28-day cycles. Day 0 (i.e., day of first dose of study agent) should
             be scheduled about 2 weeks after the last dose IV dose of belimumab but may be
             scheduled 1 week and up to 4 weeks after the last IV dose.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy
             (for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study
             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the
             subject's medical records); or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt;40 milli international unit/milliliter [MIU/mL] and
             estradiol &lt;40 picogram/mL [&lt;147 picomoles/Liter] is confirmatory). (Females on
             hormone replacement therapy [HRT] and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT
             during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 4
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
             post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
             contraceptive method.); Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as
             determined by serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening and urine
             hCG test prior to dosing; Agrees to use one of the contraception methods for 2 weeks
             prior to the day of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that
             point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until Day 112; OR has only

             diseases not due to SLE (i.e., cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic,
             gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, malignancy, or infectious diseases)
             which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, could confound the results of
