      The investigators propose to test a community-developed and targeted intervention that
      employs community health workers (CHWs) as aides to newly Medicaid-insured women. These
      women face the challenges of engaging with their healthcare and health and of making highly
      personal and socioculturally embedded decisions about reproductive health-related preventive
      services (e.g., contraception, STI and cancer screening).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All newly enrolled women in one of Arizona's state-wide Medicaid health plans (University
      Family Care) who are ambulatory and community-dwelling, and between the ages of 18-39, will
      be identified by the health plan on a monthly basis as eligible for this study. For at least
      the first month, these new health plan members will be randomized 2 to 1 (intervention to
      usual care control). Each month the health plan will provide the study team with the number
      of new members. A study team member will then provide the health plan with a list of numbers
      (1's and 0's) generated using the biased coin design to apply to those new members. To avoid
      bias, health plan staff will not be aware of members study arm.

      All new health plan enrollees (as per current standard health plan practice) receive a
      series of welcome communications (by mail and electronically) from the health plan shortly
      after enrollment. These are designed to apprise new members of health plan policies and
      procedures related to covered benefits, facilitate the selection of a primary care provider,
      and provide general preventive health resources and information. This is followed by a
      second mailing at 3-months post enrollment, as well as a nurse follow-up call. The latter is
      designed to answer questions about covered services, finding a primary care provider, and/or
      otherwise provide support. Both intervention and control group member will receive identical
      communications from the health plan up to this point. Potential participants will be
      contacted by the health plan's call center. A brief verbal overview of the intervention
      including time requirement and content to be covered will be provided. The potential
      participants who have been randomly assigned to the intervention group will then be offered
      the opportunity to set up an individual confidential appointment with a community health
      worker (CHW) at her earliest convenience.

      The call center will provide the research office a list of interested participants and their
      contact information. Once that list is received by the research office, a CHW will be
      assigned to each potential participant. The assigned CHW will call to introduce herself, to
      answer lingering questions about the intervention and proposed encounter and to confirm the
      participant's acceptance into the intervention. At that time, the CHW will confirm language
      and location preference, date/ time of proposed meeting, and the contact information for the
      research office for any questions. The CHW will meet with the subject and complete the
      informed consent process. Also, the baseline informed patient choice survey will be
      performed using a touch tablet device (to ascertain baseline knowledge, patient preferences,
      informed decision making, and health literacy). The CHW will tailor the individual education
      session to meet the unique needs of the participant (e.g., an individual who discloses a
      history of surgical sterilization will not receive information about contraception). The
      45-minute intervention will be delivered as described above. The patient will be asked to
      personally assess her needs with regard to reproductive health-related issues. The CHW will
      work with the participant to develop a personalized plan to access the relevant targeted
      preventive services. This may involve assistance with contacting the Health Plan and
      assistance with identifying or making an appointment with a primary care provider. At the
      conclusion of the intervention, the patient will be encouraged to reach out to the CHW by
      telephone or electronically if she has any subsequent questions or concerns, and
      appointments for the two booster telephone calls will be scheduled. Finally, in
      consideration for her time and participation, the participant will be provided with a $40
      gift card.

      Booster telephone support calls will occur at 2 and 4 months post intervention. A telephone
      call guide will be used to reinforce and clarify key concepts from the initial intervention
      encounter as well as to help clients formulate relevant questions related to specific
      women's preventive services and other health concerns in anticipation of their next primary
      care provider (PCP) visit. Participants will also be queried specifically about any issues
      related to interactions with the health plan and/or contacting her primary care provider.
      The patient will be assisted with connecting to the health plan or her PCP's office for
      those issues that cannot be easily addressed by the CHW. Whenever possible, every effort
      will be made by the CHW to connect the patient to the appropriate outreach staff at that
      PCP's office (if such staff is available). Again the availability of the CHW by telephone or
      electronically for interval questions will be emphasized. At month 6, the participant will
      receive a call from the telephone interviewer to administer the 6-month informed patient
      choice survey identical to the survey that was completed at baseline. A $40 gift card
      incentive will be offered to complete this survey.

    <description>Community health workers (CHWs) in Hispanic communities, often referred to as &quot;promotoras,&quot; are members of the community who use &quot;resource sharing, partnership development, education, outreach, health promotion, and disease prevention strategies to improve the health&quot; of their communities.
The intervention itself consists of a 45-minute one-on-one presentation and tailored planning session delivered by a CHW in a community setting of the new member's choosing. Presentations (in English or Spanish) will be delivered using a tablet computer or a hand held flipchart. Two booster telephone interactions will be performed at 2 and 4 months.</description>
