      The purpose of this study is to compare short-term and long-term efficacy of BiClamp forceps
      hepatectomy and clamp-crushing technique for parenchymal transection during elective hepatic
      resection.

      Background: Blood loss and the need for blood transfusions during the liver transection have
      shown to be correlated with higher morbidity and mortality rates and with worsen prognosis.
      Various devices of liver parenchymal transection have been developed with a view to reducing
      the intraoperative blood loss. However, to the present there is no randomized controlled
      trial evaluating the technique of BiClamp forceps during the liver transection. The goal of
      the present study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of BiClamp forceps
      transection in comparison to the clamp crushing technique in patients offered liver
      resection.

      Intervention: One hundred patients with hepatobiliary disease need undergo hepatectomy at
      Anhui medical university were selected and divided into BiClamp forceps hepatectomy group
      and clamp-crushing hepatectomy group, each group contains 50 cases.

      Results:

        1. Clinical data include: blood loss during liver transection, total blood loss, blood
           transfusion, hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, biliary leakage, postoperative liver
           function, liver transection time, operation time, resection margins, need for portal
           trial clamping.

        2. Statistical method: groups t-test, univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic
           regression analysis, mixed linear regression and Cox survival analysis were used.
