  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 35% of hip fracture patients have been shown to experience heart injury after surgery,
      and as many as 10% have a heart attack or die in the three months after surgery. Hip and
      knee arthroplasty patients are also at risk of cardiovascular complications. Patients who
      have these complications have higher levels of inflammation postoperatively. Statins (such
      as atorvastatin/Lipitor) lower cholesterol and also lessen inflammation. Both of these
      effects are important in preventing heart attacks. Statins have been shown to reduce the
      risk of heart attacks in non-surgical patients, and to protect from heart attacks in
      patients having heart surgery. Whether statins can prevent heart attacks in orthopedic
      patients is not known.

      In this pilot study the investigators will treat 30 orthopedic surgery patients (hip
      fracture, hip or knee arthroplasty) with either atorvastatin or placebo (a capsule with no
      study drug). Patients will start the study drug prior to surgery and take it for 45 days
      after surgery. Neither the doctors nor the patients will know whether they are taking
      atorvastatin or placebo. The investigators will look for evidence of inflammation and heart
      injury after surgery. The investigators hypothesize that atorvastatin will lessen the degree
      of postoperative inflammation found in these patients. In this study, the investigators will
      use a very sensitive test of heart injury that can detect problems even when patients have
      no symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that this test will demonstrate silent heart
      injury in over 50% of the hip fracture patients and over 30% of arthroplasty patients in our
      study.

      The results of this trial will help us to develop a larger study in 1000 hip fracture and
      joint replacement patients to determine whether atorvastatin protects orthopedic surgery
      patients from heart injury and other complications of surgery.

      -  Thirty statin-naïve patients ≥ 65 years of age admitted to New York Presbyterian
           Hospital or Hospital for Special Surgery with an acute hip fracture, or for elective
           hip or knee arthroplasty will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to atorvastatin 40 mg daily
           or matching placebo.

        -  Atorvastatin will be initiated at least 4 hours prior to hip fracture surgery, or 4
           days prior to arthroplasty, and will be continued until postoperative day (POD) 45.

        -  Patients will be assessed daily in the hospital for adverse events.

        -  Patients will be contacted by telephone weekly for four weeks after surgery and again
           on POD 45 and POD 90.

        -  Patients will mail back study medication bottles on POD 45 for pill counts to assess
           compliance.

        -  High sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) will be measured pre-operatively (prior
           to atorvastatin therapy) and on POD 2.

        -  High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and a panel of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2,
           IL-2r, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor
           (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and soluble (s)CD-40L) will be measured preoperatively and
           on POD 2.

        -  Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK) activity in peripheral
           blood mononuclear cell will be measured preoperatively and on POD 2.
