      Early Access Program to provide L-asparaginase encapsulated in Erythrocyte (GRASPA®) for
      patient unable to receive any other form of Asparaginase.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some patients can not be eligible to other clinical trials / program sponsored by Erytech
      Pharma but could have a benefit to be treated with GRASPA. Following discussion with French
      regulatory authorities, it has been suggested to propose access to GRASPA to patients unable
      to receive any other form of L-asparaginase and not eligible to the ongoing study or other
      program. This exploratory study should allow it in an &quot;Expended Access Program&quot; framework.
