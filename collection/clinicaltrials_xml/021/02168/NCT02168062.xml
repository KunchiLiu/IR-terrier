  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, phase 2 study to assess the impact of the multi-disciplinary STAND clinic on
      changes in key metabolic parameters, quality of life, and patient satisfaction among men
      receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Standard-of-care therapy will
      consist of every 3-month visits comprised of review of medical history, toxicity assessment,
      and lifestyle modification counseling provided by a dietitian and exercise physiologist on
      an as-needed basis. Men randomized to participate in the multi-disciplinary STAND clinic
      will have, in addition to every 3-month visits with an individual health care provider,
      structured and individualized exercise and dietary counseling.

      A separate non-randomized patient cohort of 20 patients who are receiving concurrent
      chemohormonal therapy will be enrolled in parallel.

      The primary hypothesis of the study is that active participation in a multi-disciplinary
      clinic, as compared to current standard-of-care, will lead to lessened impact of androgen
      deprivation therapy on metabolic parameters and improved quality of life.
