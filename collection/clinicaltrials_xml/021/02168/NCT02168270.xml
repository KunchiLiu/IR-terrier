    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ascorbic acid when given
      together with temozolomide in treating patients with high-grade glioma that has come back.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Ascorbic acid contains ingredients that may prevent or slow the growth
      of high-grade gliomas. Giving temozolomide with ascorbic acid may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities and determine the recommended dose of intravenous ascorbic
      acid given three times weekly in combination with temozolomide in patients with recurrent
      high grade glioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate changes in the levels of serum ascorbic acid (using high-performance liquid
      chromatography [HPLC] with coulometric electrochemical detection) during therapy with
      ascorbic acid and temozolomide.

      II. Radiographic assessment of disease status after 2 cycles of therapy with ascorbic acid
      and temozolomide.

      III. To evaluate progression-free and overall survival of patients with recurrent high grade
      glioma treated with therapy with ascorbic acid and temozolomide.

      IV. To descriptively examine quality of life (QOL) using European Organization for Research
      and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaires (QLQ)-C30 during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ascorbic acid.

      Patients receive ascorbic acid intravenously (IV) over 90-120 minutes three times per week
      and temozolomide orally days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 2 months for
      1 year and then periodically thereafter.
