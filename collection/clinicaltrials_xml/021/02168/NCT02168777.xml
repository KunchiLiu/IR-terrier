      Phase I: Determine the maximum tolerated dose of combination of Regorafenib with
      Refamentinib through a dose escalation study, all tumor types that meet certain
      inclusion/exclusion criteria can be entered.

      After the recommended dose is determined, the Phase II portion of the study will evaluate
      tolerability and efficacy of the combination treatment in patients with breast cancer, lung
      cancer, or colorectal cancer, respectively.

      Number of treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) will be reported in Adverse Events
      section.

      Study was originally designed with both Phase I and Phase II part, but sponsor decided not
      to conduct Phase 2 part due to strategic portfolio re-prioritization.
