  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite is safe and effective for the
      reversal of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with a cerebral
      aneurysm.

      This is a pilot single center, open-labeled study. Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage
      admitted to the hospital and who meet entry criteria will be offered enrollment into the
      study. The patients will be enrolled promptly after detection of the presence of cerebral
      vasospasm. Subjects will receive sodium nitrite infusion.

      One dose cohort is planned, 64 nmol/min/kg sodium nitrite (0.1325 mg/hour/kg; 0.0442
      ml/hour/kg at a concentration of 3mg/ml).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cerebral Vasospasm</measure>
    <time_frame>180 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Cerebral digital subtraction angiographies will be analyzed at at least 2 time points, including at the time of diagnosis of angiographic vasospasm immediately before treatment with nitrite and after up to 180 minutes of nitrite infusion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frequent assessment and recording of neurological function, neurological worsening (neurological deterioration compared to the immediate post procedure neurological status; 2 point change on the modified GCS), and neurological outcome (modified Rankin scale during hospitalization and after 3 months) will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Methemoglobin</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Methemoglobin levels will be monitored by pulse oximetry. Methemoglobin levels will be monitored and recorded every 15 minutes during the first three hours of the sodium nitrite infusion. Afterwards, methemoglobin levels will be recorded daily during the duration of the sodium nitrite infusion.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be monitored and recorded every 15 minutes during the first three hours of the sodium nitrite infusion. During the infusion, blood pressure will be monitored every 2 hours while the patient is in the ICU, and every 4 hours while the patient is on the ward.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive continuous intravenous infusion of study drug for 7 days at a dose of 64 nmol/min/kg. The infusion will begin shortly after angiographic demonstration of cerebral vasospasm and will be for 7 days unless side effects of the drug dictate stopping the infusion.</description>
