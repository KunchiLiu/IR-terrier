      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of daily
      dextromethorphan/quinidine (Nuedexta) in reducing the frequency and progression of episodic
      migraine.

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center study to be conducted
      at the Headache Care Center in Springfield, MO and two other clinics in the United States.
      Approximately 45 subjects, 18 to 65 years of age, with frequent episodic migraine (6-14 days
      per month), with (1.2) or without aura (1.1) as defined by ICHD-3beta, will enter a 1-month
      baseline period to confirm the migraine diagnosis, as well as establish baseline
      characteristics. At Visit 1, subjects must not have a history of utilization of acute
      treatment greater than 14 days per month in the preceding 3 month period. Subjects must have
      a current history of ICHD-3beta migraine with 6-14 migraine days per month in the 3 months
      prior to the study enrollment. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will occur using a computer-generated allocation
      schedule. Subjects meeting entrance criteria as determined both at screening and through the
      review of the baseline headache diary will be given the lowest available allocation number
      for that site. Migraine preventative use is permitted if the subject has been on a stable
      does for at least 2 months prior to screening and has not failed more than 3 migraine
      preventatives due to lack of efficacy. The study will consist of 5 office visits per
      subject: Visit 1 - screening, Visit 2 - randomization, and Visits 3 to 5 - three-month
      treatment period. During the baseline period, the subject will treat migraines with their
      current preferred acute treatment of choice.
