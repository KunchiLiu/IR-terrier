    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial will evaluate if a low-fat diet with fish oil has the
      potential to delay disease progression in patients with prostate cancer undergoing active
      surveillance.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if a 1-year low-fat fish oil (omega-3 fatty acid) intervention results in
      decreased prostate cancer proliferation as compared to a control group in men on active
      surveillance.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of a low-fat (LF)/fish oil (FO) intervention on prostate biopsy
      tissue markers of proliferation and cell cycle progression, prostate biopsy pathologic
      features (Gleason grade, percent of cores with cancer, percent of tissue with cancer),
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and long-term clinical outcomes (clinical progression,
      prostate cancer therapies).

      II. To evaluate potential surrogate biomarkers of proliferation (red blood cell [RBC]
      membrane fatty acid analyses, ex-vivo bioassay).

      III. To determine if a correlation exists between free fatty acid receptor 4 (GPR120) levels
      and the antiproliferative response to the LF/FO intervention.

      IV. To evaluate compliance with a 1-year LF/FO intervention. V. To evaluate safety of a
      1-year LF/FO intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive no intervention.

      ARM II: Patients receive dietary counseling with a research dietitian weekly for 1 month and
      then monthly for 11 months. Patients are given guidelines with recommended meals to follow a
      low-fat diet comprising 20% kilocalories (Kcal) from fat, 15% Kcal from protein, and 65%
      Kcal from carbohydrates for 1 year. Patients also receive 4 fish oil capsules per day orally
      (PO) for 1 year.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up yearly for 15 years.

    <description>The primary statistical analysis will be to compare the log-transformed biopsy Ki-67 values between the two intervention arms using a two-sample t-test.

    <description>Different types of regression models will be used to assess the influence of the intervention and clinical characteristics (ex. logistic regression, ordinal regression, Poisson regression instead of linear regression). Whether the omega-6/omega-3 ratio provides additional predictive information beyond group will be assessed by investigating whether it correlates with Ki-67 within each group.</description>

    <description>Linear regression will be used to correlate biopsy GPR120 gene and protein expression to 1-year Ki-67 values. GPR120 gene and protein expression will be added to the linear regression for Ki-67 constructed with group and clinical/demographic covariates. Other analyses will evaluate whether the biopsy GPR120 correlates with clinical/demographic or baseline nutrition measures (ex. fatty acid intake).</description>
