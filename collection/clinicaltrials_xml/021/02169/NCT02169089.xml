    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic disease, or hardening of the arteries, is characterized by the thickening of
      the arterial walls due to fatty deposits in wall and inflammation in the wall of arteries.
      High cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and genetics play an important role
      in developing clinical symptoms of atherosclerosis disease. The complications of advanced
      atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative, resulting in heart attack,
      stroke and/or death and blockage of arteries.

      This study is being done to assess the effectiveness of Spironolactone therapy to slow down
      the worsening of atherosclerotic disease (hardening of the arteries) in aorta (this is a
      large vessel coming out of your heart) compared to placebo (look alike sugar pill). This
      will be checked by comparing before and after therapy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      pictures of your aortic wall.

      Spironolactone is an FDA approved drug used to treat heart failure and in the management of
      hypertension (high blood pressure), but in this study it is used for another unapproved
      reason. In this study, we would like to evaluate the effects of Spironolactone in people
      with diabetes and atherosclerotic disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients &gt; 45 years and able to provide informed consent (females must
             be either post-menopausal for one year, surgically sterile, or using effective
             contraception. Oral contraceptives are disallowed.

          2. Patients with Type II Diabetes with HbA1c ≤ 8.0 on stable anti-glycemic regimen that
             may include oral and/or injectable therapy (GLP-1/Insulin etc.). No new drugs are
             allowed. Changes in dose of glycemic regimen is allowed during the course of the
             trial if felt to be clinically appropriate.

          3. In addition to Type II diabetes, 2 of the following additional high risk features:

               1. Established cardiovascular disease [previous MI, CVA or PAD OR prior
                  intervention/surgery for these conditions

               2. Age &gt;45 years

          7. Willing to sign an informed consent form to participate in the research trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP&gt;160 and/or DBP&gt;95 mmHg at visit 0 (screening) and SBP
