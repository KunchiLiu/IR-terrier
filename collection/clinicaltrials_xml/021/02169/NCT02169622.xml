    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm that can occur after coronary heart bypass
      graft operations. How often this happens and what other problems occur for a person after
      these operations needs to be better understood. This study uses a device called the Reveal
      XT, a small device that records heart rhythms to track a patient's heart rhythms after the
      bypass surgery. The device is implanted at the time the bypass graft is made. The
      information that is gathered for this study will help physicians to provide better treatment
      and follow-up of the patients under their care.
