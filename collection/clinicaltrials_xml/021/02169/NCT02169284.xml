  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well erlotinib hydrochloride works in treating
      patients with bladder cancer undergoing surgery. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if there is a difference in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      phosphorylation in normal appearing bladder epithelium adjacent to tumor approximately 9-18
      hours post-study dose, between patients randomized to erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride)
      weekly as compared to placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the tolerance of high dose weekly erlotinib compared to placebo. II. Assess the
      expression of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in tumor tissue when
      available.

      III. Assess the expression of cadherin 1, type 1 (e-cadherin) and marker of proliferation
      Ki-67 (Ki67) in normal and abnormal urothelium.

      IV. Assess the expression of phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) in normal
      and abnormal urothelium.

      V. Assess limited pharmacokinetics of weekly erlotinib. VI. Assess the expression of tumor
      protein 53 (p53) in normal and abnormal urothelium.

      VII. Assess the expression of lethal-7 (let-7) in normal and abnormal urothelium.

      VIII. Exploratory assessment of urination symptoms in men.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 8,
      and 15. Patients then undergo transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) or cystectomy
      on day 16.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients then undergo TURBT
      or cystectomy on day 16.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 7-14 days.
