    <textblock>
      Potential subjects with progressive Grade II primary brain tumor that have IDH1 positive
      testing from the primary tumor (initial diagnosis) will be offered this treatment study in
      order to test the safety of the PEPIDH1M vaccine in combination with standard chemotherapy
      (temozolomide).

    <textblock>
      After informed consent has been signed, subjects who have not had a tetanus booster within
      10 years will undergo standard of care vaccination with 0.5 mL of Td (tetanus and diphtheria
      toxoids adsorbed).

      Within 2 weeks of signing consent eligible subjects will undergo a 1-2 hour leukapheresis
      (to pull off white blood cells) for immune monitoring and within 48 hours vaccine site
      pre-conditioning will be performed as a single dose of Td toxoid (in a total volume of 0.4
      mLs salt water/saline) given in the intradermal space (just under the surface of the skin)
      12-24 hours prior to receiving PEPIDH1M vaccine in the same manner. The peptide vaccine is
      administered in the upper thigh area approximately 4 inches below the groin in the
      intradermal space as vaccine # 1. Subsequent vaccines will be given on day 15 ±3 days
      (vaccine #2) and day 30 ±3 days (vaccine #3). All injections will alternate sides. These
      injections will occur without temozolomide (standard of care chemotherapy).

      Seven to 10 days after the 3rd vaccine, subjects will have peripheral blood work drawn for
      immunologic monitoring. This will be followed by surgery to remove the tumor no less than 3
      days and no longer than 7 days after the immunologic monitoring blood work. Tumor samples
      will be evaluated for the IDH1 markers and analyzed for other cells that may have entered
      the tumor.

      Based on tissue obtained at surgery, subjects with stable histologic grade at recurrence
      will then be treated with vaccine and temozolomide. During monthly cycles of temozolomide,
      subjects will receive the vaccine on day 21 ±2 days for a maximum of 15 total vaccines
      (which includes the first 3 bi-weekly vaccines). Patients that have transitioned to a higher
      Grade brain tumor will not be eligible to continue and will be removed from the study. All
      Adverse Events will be collected from time of consent until off study. For purposes of this
      study, subjects will be considered off study 2 months after the last vaccine. Subjects will
      be followed only for survival thereafter.

      For immune monitoring, a final peripheral blood draw will be performed following 3 months of
      temozolomide and vaccine therapy. Peripheral blood will also be drawn for immune monitoring
      evaluation at progression, if possible.

      For biomarker testing, subjects will have blood and urine collected during the following
      times: prior to vaccine therapy (at consent or leukapheresis visit), prior to vaccine #3,
      prior to surgery to remove the tumor, prior to discharge from hospital following the surgery
      to remove the tumor, prior to each subsequent monthly vaccine administrations, and at
      progression (if possible).

      Subjects will be imaged with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to
      standard of care every 2 months ±2 weeks while on temozolomide and afterward, per the
      treating neuro-oncologist's recommendation. Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO)
      criteria will be used for assessment of pseudoprogression and tumor progression. Subjects
      demonstrating definitive progression will be removed from study.

      As part of standard care for these subjects, upon tumor progression, participants may
      undergo biopsy or resection. As this is not a research procedure, consent will be obtained
      separately. Subjects that have this procedure done within the Duke University Health System
      will be asked to have a portion of the tumor sample, if possible, to assess immunologic cell
      infiltration, antigen expression, and biomarkers for immunologic response.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of patients with an unacceptable toxicity will be estimated.</measure>
    <time_frame>After first 6 subjects have received initial 3 vaccines and then surgical resection, an expected average of 8 months after study opened for enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>An unacceptable toxicity is defined as any Grade 3 toxicity attributed to the vaccine (or vaccine + TMZ) that does not resolve to baseline in 2-3 weeks, any Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions requiring steroids, any Grade 4 toxicity, including neurologic events not due to progressive disease, or any life threatening-event not attributable to concomitant medication, co-morbid event, or disease progression. 6 subjects will be accrued to the study after which accrual will be suspended until last patient enrolled undergoes resection. If 2 or less of these subjects experience an unacceptable toxicity, accrual will continue. Otherwise, modifications of the protocol will be considered before accruing additional subjects. If a patient who has not experienced an unacceptable toxicity does not complete 3 vaccinations, that patient will be replaced for initial study monitoring.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IFNγ ELIspot Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Levels of immune response will be examined after 3 vaccinations (i.e., pre-surgery) as well as after 3 additional post-surgery vaccinations, an expected average of 24 weeks after study initiation.</time_frame>
    <description>Values for cells cultured with IDH1 peptide, after subtraction of counts from cells cultured with no peptide, will be determined. A response will be considered positive if this value is greater than 20 SFC per 10^6 lymphocytes after determining the level of detection in the IDH ELISpot. With 20 patients, there is 80% power to detect a difference of 4.17 SFC per10^6 lymphocytes between response for cells cultured in IDH1 peptide and those cultured without any peptide. This power calculation conservatively assumes the response to IDH1 peptide and no peptide to be independent, and did not adjust for multiplicity.</description>
