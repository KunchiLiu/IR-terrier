  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marijuana is by far the mostly commonly used illicit drug during pregnancy, and prenatal
      exposure to marijuana can have lasting negative effects. However, current answers to this
      problem are failing to reach most women who use marijuana while pregnant. This project will
      develop and begin testing two technology-based, highly practical interventions that could
      reduce the number of children who are prenatally exposed to marijuana.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are at present no evidence-based interventions for marijuana use during pregnancy,
      despite its being by far the most commonly used illicit drug during pregnancy (particularly
      among African-American women), and despite growing evidence that it may have a range of
      long-term cognitive and neurobehavioral consequences. This R34 clinical trial planning grant
      therefore proposes the development and preliminary validation of two high- reach and
      mutually compatible technology-based interventions for marijuana use during pregnancy. The
      first, a theory-based, synchronous, and highly interactive computer-delivered brief
      intervention, will be based on an emerging knowledge base regarding key elements of
      efficacious technology-delivered interventions. The second intervention, a series of
      tailored text messages, will build on the rich literature regarding key tailoring elements.
      These interventions will be developed and refined with input from pregnant women who report
      active use of marijuana, as well as from health care providers. They will subsequently be
      tested-alone and in combination-in a pilot randomized trial involving 80 women actively
      using marijuana during pregnancy. This Stage I pilot work would set the stage for a
      confirmatory Stage II trial. It would also produce the first high-reach brief interventions
      for marijuana use during pregnancy. If effective, these approaches could have a substantial
      population impact on marijuana use among pregnant women, with potential for lifelong
      improved outcomes for both mother and child.

    <description>Participants in this condition will receive empathic exploration of their thoughts regarding marijuana use, provision of information on possible consequences of marijuana use during pregnancy and potential benefits of changing use (with permission), normed feedback, use of Motivational Interviewing techniques to elicit their own reasons for change, video testimonials modeling successful change, and information on change methods with optional goal setting.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in this condition will chose the frequency and time of text messages that will continue until childbirth or the participant opts out. The text messages will be a mix of marijuana targeted content (without directly referring to marijuana in a way that implies use by the participant) and general content related to healthy pregnancy; using appropriate humor and tips for community resources. Tailoring will focus on gestational age, self-efficacy, and social support.</description>
