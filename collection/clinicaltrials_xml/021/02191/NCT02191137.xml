      The MOTION study is a prospective, Phase IV study, enrolling 61 patients with Pulmonary
      Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The study designed to further explore patient-reported outcomes
      in PAH subjects who are not on active treatment and living in the United States. In
      addition, the study will be exploring the use of new telemetric technology (Accelerator
      band) to evaluate if this technology correlates with improvements in 6 Minute Walking
      Distance 6MWD in patients with PAH

    <measure>Living with Pulmonary Hypertension questionaire(LPH)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The self-reported Living with Pulmonary Hypertension (LPH) questionnaire is designed to measure the effects of PH and PH-specific treatments on an individual's quality of life. The LPH total score can range from 0 (best) to 105 (worst)</description>

    <measure>Work Limitations Questionnaire-8</measure>
    <time_frame>16 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WLQ is used to measure the impairment in work related productivity, with reference to the previous two weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-12 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>16 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 is used as an instrument to measure participants' physical wellbeing (physical component) and mental wellbeing (mental component). Scores for each component range from 0-100, with 0= lowest wellbeing, and 100=highest wellbeing</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Borg Dyspnea Index</measure>
    <time_frame>16 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Borg Dyspnea Index is a participant reported outcome measure used in clinical diagnosis of e.g. breathlessness and dyspnea. It documents the participant's exertion during a physical test. Low values indicate low levels of exertion; high values indicate more intense exertion reported by the participant. The score ranges from 0 (&quot;Nothing at all&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Extremely strong - Maximal&quot;)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6- minutes walk distance</measure>
    <time_frame>16 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>6-minute walking distance (6MWD) is a measure for the objective evaluation of a patient's functional exercise capacity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>WHO Functional Class</measure>
    <time_frame>16 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO functional assessment of pulmonary arterial hypertension ranged from functional class I (participants with PH but without resulting limitation of physical activity) to class IV (participants with PH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These participants manifest signs of right-heart failure.). Changes to a lower WHO functional class resemble improvement; changes to a higher functional class resemble deterioration of PAH</description>
