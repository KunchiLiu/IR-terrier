  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to investigate if a new technique to biopsy the pancreas will
      lead to a larger amount tissue material that can be analyzed. Investigators have called the
      technique the &quot;corkscrew&quot; technique and believe it will allow obtaining a larger biopsy
      sample during the endoscopic ultrasound examination. The corkscrew technique uses a
      clockwise rotational movement to drive the needle into the pancreatic mass (like a wine
      bottle opener twists and buries itself into a cork). It is believed that this will lead to a
      better biopsy sample than the usual way and therefore result in a higher chance of a
      diagnosis.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study stopped as the used needle was difficult to maneuver in the corkscrew method being
    studied so no more participants were included.
