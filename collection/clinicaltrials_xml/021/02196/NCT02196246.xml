  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate an iPad based photoimage analysis system (Moletest) for improving discrimination
      of benign from malignant suspicious skin lesions or moles. Specifically the objective is to
      demonstrate that the Moletest system is able with a sufficient degree of confidence (95%) to
      identify lesions which are benign
