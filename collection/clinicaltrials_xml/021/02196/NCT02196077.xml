    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb, randomized, double blind, chronic dosing (28 days), four period, five
      treatment, incomplete block, crossover design in subjects with moderate to severe COPD. The
      overall objective is to demonstrate that the combination of budesonide (BD; PT008) and
      formoterol fumarate (FF; PT005) in a metered-dose inhaler (MDI); (BFF MDI; PT009) provides
      benefit on lung function compared with BD MDI in subjects with moderate to severe COPD.

             the cause of COPD -Active pulmonary disease such as active tuberculosis, lung cancer,
             bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension,
             interstitial lung disease, and uncontrolled sleep apnea (ie., in the opinion of the
             Investigator severity of the disorder would impact the conduct of the study)-

          -  Clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, endocrinologic,
             pulmonary, hematological, psychiatric, or other medical illness that would interfere

          -  Clinically significant, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy

          -  Male subjects with a trans-urethral resection of the prostate or full resection of
             the prostate within 6 months prior to Screening

          -  Clinically significant bladder neck obstruction or urinary retention

          -  Inadequately treated glaucoma

          -  History of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to any drug or to any component
             of the formulations used in this study
