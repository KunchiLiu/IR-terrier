  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well cisplatin with or without WEE1 inhibitor
      MK-1775 works in treating patients with head and neck cancer that has come back or has
      spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, may
      prevent tumor cells from multiplying by damaging their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which in
      turn stops the tumor from growing. WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether
      cisplatin is more effective with or without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 in treating patients with
      head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the overall response rate assess the efficacy of MK-1775 (WEE1 inhibitor
      MK-1775) in combination with cisplatin to cisplatin alone in patients with recurrent or
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) as per overall response rate
      (using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria version [v]1.1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess secondary measures of efficacy (progression free survival at 6 months and 12
      months, overall survival rate at 12 months).

      II. Assess measures of efficacy by tumor protein (p)53 status. III. Evaluate safety and
      tolerability. IV. Explore predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

      OUTLINE:

      SAFETY RUN-IN: Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 5
      doses beginning on day 1 and cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 PO BID for 5 doses beginning on day 1 and
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 5 doses beginning on day 1 and cisplatin IV over
      2 hour on day 1.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.
