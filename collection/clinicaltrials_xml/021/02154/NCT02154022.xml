  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Certain drugs even when they are meant to help people cause side effects. These are
      unwanted effects of the drug. There are many reasons why a drug might cause side effects in
      one person and not in another. It may be because of how much of the drug is in the person s
      blood at one time. Researchers want to study the blood of people having drug side effects to
      better understand why they happen.

      Objective:

      - To obtain blood samples from patients being treated with an investigational or FDA
      approved drug at the National Cancer Institute who are having bad side effects that are
      thought to be due to large amount of the drug in their blood. The samples will be used to
      assess the cause of the side effects.

      Eligibility:

      - People 2 years and older with cancer who are currently enrolled in clinical trials at the
      National Cancer Institute.

      Design:

      - Participants will give blood samples.

      Background:

        -  Pharmacology is the study of pharmaceutical compounds , and encompasses several
           parameters, including how the body handles the substance (pharmacokinetics, PK), what
           the substance does to the body at the molecular level (pharmacodynamics), overall
           efficacy (response), and any adverse events or toxicity encountered.

        -  The Clinical Pharmacology Program (CPP) within the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) of
           the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has sensitive, state of the art bioanalytical
           instrumentation that can accurately and precisely quantitate drug concentrations in
           plasma.

        -  Currently, the CPP can only analyze samples from clinical trials that have explicit
           instructions (within the Pharmacokinetics section) to do so in the IRB approved
           protocol.

        -  However, clinical trial protocols without a Pharmacokinetics section may still need
           occasional pharmacokinetic plasma samples drawn and drug concentration measurements
           performed to help explain unexpected AEs or toxicity.

      Objectives:

      - To obtain PK plasma samples from patients being treated with an investigational agent or
      FDA approved therapy at the NCI who are exhibiting toxicity that is believed to be due to
      high drug concentration in order to assess the cause of the toxicity and adverse events.

      Eligibility:

      - Any cancer patients who are currently enrolled in IRB approved clinical trials at the
      National Cancer Institute are eligible.

      Design:

        -  The CPP will measure the drug plasma concentration (or send the sample out to a third
           party if the assay is commercially available).

        -  The accrual ceiling for this study is 100 patients. The anticipated accrual rate for
           this protocol is less than 10 patients per year, and based on the accrual ceiling, the
           duration of accrual and the total study duration is 5 years.
