  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will examine if enhancing Nitric Oxide (NO) bioavailability increases the rates
      of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation in end stage renal disease patients requiring
      vascular access for hemodialysis. To enhance NO bioavailability the study team will utilize
      a program of forearm exercise training, application of nitroglycerin ointment or both. Goals
      of this study are (A) to measure if recruited subjects can tolerate the intervention
      protocols, and determine if dependent variable measures, including surgery outcome, and
      measurement of physiologic and biologic markers, can be obtained; (B) To measure subject
      compliance and adherence rates for each of the intervention arms and testing visits; (C) To
      examine which intervention or combination of interventions demonstrates the strongest
      preliminary effects in order to estimate power for a pivotal intent to treat trial; and (D)
      explore group differences in clinical vascular markers and biologic markers in vein tissue.

      This project will examine if enhancing Nitric Oxide (NO) bioavailability increases the rates
      of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation in end stage renal disease patients requiring
      vascular access for hemodialysis. To enhance NO bioavailability the study team will utilize
      a program of forearm exercise training, application of nitroglycerin ointment or both.

      Following entry into the study, approximately 4 weeks prior to surgery subjects will undergo
      a series of non-invasive tests of vascular function in the arm of fistula creation.
      Following this vascular function testing, subjects will follow the intervention treatment
      for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of intervention treatment and prior to surgery, the vascular
      function analysis will be repeated to determine if the interventions had an effect on arm
      vascular function. Surgery to create the AVF will follow the second vascular function
      analysis. A discard sample of the vein used to create the AVF and a blood sample will be
      collected during surgery to assess potential biologic differences between intervention
      groups. The interventions will be continued until 4 weeks following surgery. Subjects will
      be followed to determine if the AVF matured and was successfully used for dialysis.
