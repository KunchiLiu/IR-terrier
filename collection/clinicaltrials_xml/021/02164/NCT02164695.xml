      To evaluate whether remote ischemic per-conditioning (RIPC) can reduce infarct size in
      patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PPCI) within 12 hours of symptoms onset.

    <textblock>
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity.
      Early myocardial reperfusion with either of thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PPCI) is the most effective strategy for reducing the size of a
      myocardial infarct and improving the clinical outcome. Although this process can restore
      blood flow to the ischemic myocardium, it can induce injury. This phenomenon, termed
      myocardial reperfusion injury, can paradoxically reduce the beneficial effects of myocardial
      reperfusion. Pre-clinical study in animal models of acute myocardial infarction suggest that
      lethal reperfusion injury accounts for up to 50% of the final size of a myocardial infarct.

      Remote ischemic conditioning uses brief ischemia and reperfusion of a distant organ to
      protect the myocardium. In animal study, remote ischemic postconditioning seems to be more
      effective than local postconditioning in experimental myocardial infarction.Bøtker et al.
      has reported remote ischemic preconditioning before hospital admission increase myocardial
      salvage in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

      The objectives of this study is to evaluate whether remote ischemic per-conditioning (RIPC)
      can reduce infarct size in patients with STEMI treated with PPCI within 12 hours of symptoms
      onset. To test this hypothesis, we will randomize patients into PPCI + RIPC or PPCI alone.
      We will evaluate marker of reperfusion injury using contrast cardiac magnetic resonance
      image.

    <measure>Salvage index measured by contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 5 days after index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The hyperintense signal in T2W short tau inversion-recovery fast spin-echo images will be considered for myocardial edema (area at risk). Edema volume will be computed including signal at least 2 SD above the mean of noninfarcted myocardium. Hyperintense signal from the blood pool will be excluded. Myocardial hemorrhage will be defined as a hypointense signal within the area of edema. Hemorrhage will be included in the computation of T2W edema volume. Infarct size will be assessed on late-contrast images (≈15 min after gadolinium administration) by manually tracing the hyperintense area in each short-axis slice. Microvascular obstruction will be defined as a hypointense signal in the infarct-related myocardium and will be assessed by manually tracing the suspected area in each short-axis slice. Salvage index will be calculated as (area at risk - infarction)/area at risk x 100(%).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Enzymatic Infarct Size</measure>
    <time_frame>1 to 5 days after index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Enzymatic infarct size will be assessed by the area under the curve of creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) and troponin I (TnI) release. Blood samples will be collected before PCI and every day after index PPCI. Area under the curve of CK-MB and troponin I release will be expressed in arbitrary units and calculated with the trapezoidal method.</description>

    <measure>Resolution of ST-segment deviation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 to 5 days after index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>ST-segment deviation score will be measured in 12-lead electrocardiograms, calculated as the sum (in millimeters) of ST-segment deviation (elevation or depression) at 80 ms after the J-point in all 12 leads. ST-segment deviation score will be measured at presentation and 30 min after PCI, by 2 physicians blinded as to the patients' data, and the mean value of the 2 assessments will be used. ST-segment resolution will be calculated as a percentage: ratio of the reduction in ST-segment deviation score from presentation to half an hour after PCI over the ST-segment deviation score at presentation × 100% (i.e., [(ST-segment deviation at presentation − ST-segment deviation post-PCI)/ST-segment deviation at presentation] × 100%). Full ST-segment resolution will be defined as 80% or more reduction of ST-segment deviation score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute kidney injury</measure>
    <time_frame>1 to 3 days after index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Acute kidney injury will be defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.5 mg/dl or a relative increase of ≥25% compared with baseline within 96 h after PCI (the maximal measured concentration of serum creatinine during these 96 h will be used). Relative reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, within 96 h after PCI will be assessed.</description>

    <description>Remote ischemic perconditioning protocol (RIPC):
All patients will be prepared with an upper-arm blood pressure cuff before arterial puncture (contralateral in case of radial access). In patients allocated into PPCI plus RIPC group, the protocol will be started immediately after cuff preparation. Upper-arm will be exposed to 4 cycles of ischemia/reperfusion, each obtained by 5 min cuff inflation at 200mmHg, followed by 5 min complete deflation.</description>

    <description>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) :
All patients will be pre-treated with a loading dose of 300 mg aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel (or 60 mg prasugrel, or 180 mg ticagrelor). 5000 IU unfractionated heparin (UFH) will be given before angiography and additional 5000 IU of UFH will be given during angiography. Additional use of UFH will be permitted to achieve target ACT (250 sec). Coronary angiography will be performed by either femoral or radial approach. Both groups will receive PPCI according to standard techniques; the use of thrombectomy, of intravascular ultrasound, and of inhibitors of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) will be at the operator's discretion.</description>
