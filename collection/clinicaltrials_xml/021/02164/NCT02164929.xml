  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of transversus abdominal plane
      (TAP) block, thoracic epidural or paravertebral block (PVB) for controlling postoperative
      pain when compared with opioid you self-administer in your vein using a PCA device. The
      primary outcome will be postoperative opioid consumption within 24 hours after surgery. A
      total of 120 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive a TAP block, PVB, TEA
      or no block (PCA alone).Patients in all groups will be cared for using an established
      enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway incorporating a multimodal analgesic regimen
      using IV acetaminophen and postoperative PCA fentanyl.

    <description>Bilateral PVB will be placed between T7-T10 interspaces preoperatively. Patients will be in a sitting position which allows easy identification of landmarks, and the patients are often more comfortable. Ultrasound will be used to identify the paravertebral space. At the appropriate dermatome under aseptic precautions, the needle (22-gauge, 8-10-cm short beveled spinal needle) will inserted 2.5-3 cm lateral to the most cephalad aspect of the spinous process and advanced perpendicular to the skin in all planes to contact the transverse process 3 of the vertebra below at a variable depth (2-4 cm). A 10 mL ropivacaine 0.25% will be injected at both T7 and T9 levels on each side (40 mL in total).</description>

    <description>Bilateral posterior and subcostal TAP blocks guided by ultrasound will be performed in the preoperative holding area. A total of 80 mL ropivacaine 0.25% (4 injections, 20 mL per injection) will be injected evenly upon identification of the appropriate planes. In the event the placement of block is uncomfortable for the patients, it will be performed after induction of anesthesia. This approach is currently practiced in the OR. Extent and degree of anesthetic blockage will be measured using a 5-point sensation scale following the procedure at 4 areas on the anterior abdominal wall (above and below the umbilicus bilaterally).</description>

    <description>An epidural catheter will be inserted between T8-10 in the preoperative holding area, and a test dose of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine will be given. Extent and degree of anesthetic blockage will be measured using a 5-point sensation following the procedure and postoperatively at 4 areas on the anterior abdominal wall (above and below the umbilicus bilaterally).
A bolus does of epidural hydromorphone (400-800 mcg) will be given preoperatively. An infusion of bupivacaine 0.25% at 4-6 ml/hour will be commenced before incision, and if tolerated, continued throughout surgery. Adjustments that may be required secondary to specific patient hemodynamic status will be left to the discretion of the individual anesthesiologist and guided by the specific patient requirements.</description>

    <description>Premedication with midazolam up to 2 mg. General anesthesia is induced with propofol 1-2.5 mg/kg. Dexamethasone 4 mg IV will be administered after induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane to keep a bispectral index of between 40-60. Neuromuscular blocking drug and reversal agent of choice may be used. Local infiltration with 10 mL of plain ropivacaine 0.25% will be administered at the surgical incision site at the end of surgery. Acetaminophen 1g IV will be administered following induction of anesthesia will be administered at the end of the procedure</description>
