      The current food effect study is being performed to support a Phase 3 study with BMS 663068.
      Results from this study will inform whether patients in the upcoming Phase 3 study can be
      given the flexibility to dose BMS-663068 in the fasted state, if so desired.

      Primary Purpose: Other: To assess the effect of food on the steady-state exposure of
      BMS-626529 when administered as BMS 663068 600 mg twice daily (BID) to healthy subjects

      Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
