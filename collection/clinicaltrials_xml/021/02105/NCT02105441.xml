  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Do adults and older children (greater than 7 years of age) with unilateral or assymetric
      hearing loss benefit from cochlear implantation on the worst hearing side.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral hearing loss is known to impair binaural hearing abilities. Specifically,
      localization, speech understanding in noise, and binaural squelch suffer due to lack of
      binaural timing and level cues. This study is designed to examine how binaural hearing is
      improved following cochlear implantation on the impaired side. The study endpoints are
      collected at 6 months and 12 months post activation of the implant.

    <description>A dual task performance paradigm will be used in which both the primary task and the secondary task will be performed simultaneously. The primary task will consist of speech recognition testing in varying levels of background noise and quiet, whereas the secondary task will consist of a motor reaction to a randomly presented light</description>

        This study includes adults and children over 7 years of age who have suffered single sided
        deafness. The hearing loss must be present more than 6 months, and less than 2 years to be
        considered for inclusion. Word understanding on the impaired side must not exceed 50%
        correct in the best aided condition.

      <textblock>
        Adults

          -  18 years of age or older,

          -  Hearing loss in the ear to be implanted must such that speech understanding is not
             possible with a well fitted hearing aid. Specifically, less than 40% monosyllabic
             word understanding when that ear is tested in the best-aided condition and the other
             ear is sufficiently occluded or masked.

          -  Onset of hearing loss in the adult group must be within the past two years for the
             ear to be implanted.

        Children

          -  Children 7 years of age and older

          -  Hearing loss in the ear to be implanted configured such that word understanding is
             less 40% in the best aided condition

          -  Onset of hearing loss recent within the past two years, and that occurred after the
             critical period of auditory development; the third year of life (Sharma et al.,
             2005).
