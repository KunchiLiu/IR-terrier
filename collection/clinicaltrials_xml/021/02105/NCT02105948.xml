  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial
      evaluating mepolizumab 100 mg against placebo given every 4 weeks through subcutaneous (SC)
      injection.

      In severe COPD patients, sputum eosinophils levels are elevated similar as those seen in
      severe asthmatics. It is hypothesized that the reduction of eosinophils with mepolizumab in
      COPD patients would translate into a reduction of COPD exacerbations. The study will
      determine the reduction in exacerbations in subjects who are above and below the baseline
      blood eosinophil count of at least 150 cells/microlitres. The study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of mepolizumab on the frequency of moderate and severe exacerbations in
      COPD subjects at high risk of exacerbations, despite the use of optimized standard of care
      background therapy.

      Overall in this study, a total of 800 subjects will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive
      placebo or mepolizumab (100 milligram (mg)) administered SC. The total duration of this
      study will be approximately 62 weeks, consisting of a 1 to 2 week screening period, 52-week
      treatment period and 8-week follow-up period.

             year in accordance with the definition by the American Thoracic Society/European
             Respiratory Society.

          -  Severity of COPD: Subjects must present with the following: a measured pre and
             post-salbutamol Forced expiratory volume in one second/ Forced vital capacity
             (FEV1/FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 at Visit 1 to confirm the diagnosis of COPD; a measured
             post-salbutamol FEV1&gt;20 percent and &lt;=80 percent of predicted normal values
             calculated using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III
             reference equations at Visit 1.

          -  History of exacerbations: A well documented history (like medical record
             verification) in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 of: at least two moderate COPD
             exacerbations. Moderate is defined as the use of systemic corticosteroids (IM,
             intravenous, or oral) and/or treatment with antibiotics, or at least one severe COPD
             exacerbation. Severe is defined as having required hospitalization. Note: At least

             corticosteroid (ICS) plus long acting beta2-agonist (LABA) plus long acting
             muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Note: Prior use of antibiotics alone does not qualify
             as a moderate exacerbation unless the use was specifically for the treatment of
             worsening symptoms of COPD.

          -  Concomitant COPD therapy: A well documented requirement for optimized standard of
             care (SoC) background therapy that includes ICS plus 2 additional COPD medications
             (i.e., triple therapy) for the 12 months prior to Visit 1 and meets the following
             criteria: Immediately prior to Visit 1, minimum of 3 months of use of an inhaled
             corticosteroid (at a dose &gt;=500 micrograms (mcg)/day fluticasone propionate dose
             equivalent plus); or LABA and LAMA.

        For subjects who are not continually maintained on ICS plus LABA plus LAMA for the entire
        12 months prior to Visit 1 use of following is allowed (but not in the 3 months
        immediately prior to Visit 1): inhaled corticosteroid at a dose &gt;=500 mcg/day fluticasone
        propionate dose equivalent plus ; a LABA or a LAMA and use of at least one other class of
        COPD medication suggested by the 2013 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung
        Disease (GOLD) guidelines for patients who are prone to exacerbation (i.e.,
        phosphodiesterase-4-inhibitors, methylxanthines, or a combination of short acting
        beta-2-agonist and short acting muscarinic antagonist). Note: Subjects must be willing to
        stay on their SoC COPD medication for the duration of the study.

          -  Informed Consent: Able to give written informed consent prior to participation in the
             study, which will include the ability to comply with the requirements and

          -  Age: At least 40 years of age at Visit 1.

          -  Smoking status: Subject with confirmed COPD are eligible to participate independent
             of their smoking status and smoking history, i.e. current smokers, never smokers or
             ex-smokers can be enrolled into the study; Current smokers are defined as those with
             a history of cigarette smoking of &gt;=10 pack-years [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10
             years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]; Former smokers are defined as those
             who meet the definition of a current smoker but have stopped smoking for at least 6
             months prior to Visit 1; Never smokers are those that do not meet the definition of a

             cardiologist to assist in consistent evaluation of subject eligibility. Results from
             the 12-lead ECG over-read must be received prior to assessing eligibility at Visit 2.

        Randomization Criteria

        In order to be randomized to study drug the subject must meet the following randomization
        criteria at Visit 2:

          -  Blood eosinophils: While there is no threshold for enrolment, information on
             eosinophil level should be obtained prior to randomization.

          -  Electronic Diary Compliance: Compliance with completion of the eDiary defined as
             completion of all questions on 5 or more days out of the 7 days immediately preceding
             Visit 2.

          -  12-lead ECG: No evidence of an abnormal and significant ECG finding from the 12- lead
             ECG conducted at Visit 1 as indicated on the over-read provided by the centralized
             independent cardiologist. Subjects with a QT interval corrected with Fridericia's
             formulas (QTcF)&gt;=450 msec are not eligible. For subjects with a QRS interval &gt;=120
             msec, those with QTcF&gt;=480 msec are not eligible. Specific ECG findings that preclude
             subject eligibility are listed in the protocol.

          -  Abnormal chest X-ray (or Computerized Tomography [CT scan]): No chest X-ray (or CT
             scan) that reveals evidence of clinically significant abnormalities other than those
             believed to be due to the presence of COPD. If a chest X-ray or CT scan is not
             available within 6 months prior to Visit 1, then a chest X-ray must be taken at Visit
             1 and the results reviewed prior to randomization. For sites in Germany: If a chest
             X-ray (or CT scan) within 6 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, the
             subject will not be eligible for the study.

          -  Laboratory abnormality: No evidence of clinically significant abnormality in the
             haematological, biochemical, or urinalysis screen at Visit 1, as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  Hepatitis B: Subjects who are HBsAg positive or HBcAb positive must not have a HBV
             DNA level &gt;= 2000 IU/ml.
