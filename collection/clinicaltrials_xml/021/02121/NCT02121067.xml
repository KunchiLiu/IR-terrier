    <textblock>
      This is a study of 50 postpartum women interested in having the Mirena® LNG-IUS placed for
      contraception. The Mirena® is an FDA approved intrauterine contraceptive device that
      provides contraception for 5 years with excellent effectiveness. Women enrolled in this
      study will only have the Mirena® placed at two-weeks postpartum (day 14-20 postpartum). The
      participants will be followed at 6-weeks and 6-months postpartum for study visits to
      evaluate for satisfaction, symptoms, expulsion, and perforation. The study will be completed
      at six-months postpartum, and participants will be able to keep their LNG-IUS following
      study completion.
