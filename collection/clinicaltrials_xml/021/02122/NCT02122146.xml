      To assess the safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels of PF-06664178 in patients
      with advanced solid tumors in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose and select the
      recommended Phase 2 dose.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was prematurely discontinued due to a business-related decision on 09-FEB-2016. The
    decision to terminate the trial was based on the overall results.
