    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II clinical trial studies how well gemcitabine hydrochloride and WEE1
      inhibitor MK-1775 work compared to gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with
      ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back after a period of
      time. Gemcitabine hydrochloride may prevent tumor cells from multiplying by damaging their
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, molecules that contain instructions for the proper development
      and functioning of cells), which in turn stops the tumor from growing. The protein WEE1 may
      help to repair the damaged tumor cells, so the tumor continues to grow. WEE1 inhibitor
      MK-1775 may block the WEE1 protein activity and may increase the effectiveness of
      gemcitabine hydrochloride by preventing the WEE1 protein from repairing damaged tumor cells
      without causing harm to normal cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine hydrochloride
      with or without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may be an effective treatment for recurrent ovarian,
      primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of subjects with recurrent
      platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer receiving
      gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in combination with AZD 1775 (MK-1775 [WEE1
      inhibitor MK-1775]) compared to subjects receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with AZD 1775 (MK-1775) compared to
      patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo.

      II. To evaluate the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) cancer antigen (CA)125 response
      rate of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with AZD 1775 (MK-1775) compared to patients
      receiving gemcitabine in combination with placebo.

      III. To evaluate the overall survival of patients (max 1-year [yr] follow-up) receiving
      gemcitabine combined with AZD 1775 (MK-1775) compared to patients receiving gemcitabine in
      combination with placebo.

      IV. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of gemcitabine combined with
      AZD 1775 (MK-1775) in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or
      primary peritoneal cancer.

      V. To evaluate tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations (presence of mutation and type of
      mutation) as potential predictive factors of benefit (defined as response or
      progression-free survival [PFS] prolongation) to AZD 1775 (MK-1775) and gemcitabine
      treatment.

      VI. To evaluate p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry as potential predictive
      factors of benefit (defined as response or PFS prolongation) to AZD 1775 (MK-1775) and
      gemcitabine treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate patient reported outcomes using Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO)-Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      II. To evaluate the concordance of TP53 mutations in the tumor specimen and TP53 mutations
      determined by tagged-amplicon deep sequencing (Tam-Seq) in circulating tumor DNA.

      III. To correlate the levels circulating DNA TP53 mutations by Tam-Seq with response.

      IV. Validation of phosphorylated-cyclin-dependent cycle 2 (pCDC2) and gamma-H2A histone
      family, member X (H2AX) in skin and tumor tissue as a pharmacodynamic marker of therapy.

      V. To correlate changes in pCDC2 and gamma-H2AX with survival outcomes and response rate.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally (PO) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16
      and gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride as patients in Arm I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-8 weeks for up to 1
      year.
