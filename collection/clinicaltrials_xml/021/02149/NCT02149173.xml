      This clinical trial studies use of [F-18] 16 alpha-fluoroestradiol ([F-18] FES) positron
      emission tomography (PET) in measuring tumor hormone receptor expression in patients
      undergoing endocrine-targeted therapy for newly diagnosed breast cancer or breast cancer
      that has come back or spread to other places in the body. Comparing results of diagnostic
      procedures done before, during, and after hormone therapy may help measure a patient's
      response to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure the effect of endocrine targeted therapy on estrogen receptor (ER) expression and
      estradiol binding to the receptor using serial FES PET and fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Document the safety profile of FES PET in patients with breast cancer.

      II. Examine associations between FES PET results and serial measurements of hormone or other
      levels in peripheral blood, as related to efficacy of endocrine-targeted therapy. Correlate
      FES PET uptake measures with histopathological assays and tumor microenvironment studies on
      biopsy specimens, if relevant to specific treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo F-18 FES PET scan at baseline. Patients also undergo F-18 FES PET and FDG
      PET between 1-12 weeks after starting therapy, and then 1-12 weeks after the second FES PET
      scan.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 20 years.

    <description>Quantitative and qualitative measures of FES update for each disease site, a set of 1.5 cm diameter regions on three adjacent planes with the highest lesion FES uptake will be drawn to determine maximal FES uptake. Up to the largest 3 lesions seen on the dynamic scan will be quantified, and up to the 5 largest sites seen on the static torso survey will be quantified. Partial-volume correction will not be used because only sites 1.5 cm or greater diameter will be included in quantitative analysis.</description>
