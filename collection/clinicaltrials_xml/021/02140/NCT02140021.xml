      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how often high-grade dysplasia or
      invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the anus occurs in women with high-grade dysplasia
      invasive squamous cell carcinoma, invasive adenocarcinoma, or AIS of the cervix, vagina, or
      vulva.

    <textblock>
      Anal cancer as well as cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancer can be caused by an infection
      called human papillomavirus (HPV). Researchers do not know how often anal cancer and
      dysplasia occur together with cervical, vaginal or vulvar high-grade dysplasia, or invasive
      squamous cell carcinoma. All of these diseases are caused by the HPV virus and for this
      reason are thought to be related. Researchers also want to learn how to test for these
      diseases.

      If you agree to take part in this study, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed either during your scheduled colposcopy as part of a clinic visit, or during your
      scheduled surgery. These tests are performed to test for pre-cancer of the anal canal.

        -  You will have an anal pap test. To perform this test, a small swab is placed in your
           anal canal to collect cells, similar to the pap test performed on your cervix. This
           sample will also be used to test for anal HPV. A second swab will be collected for
           research testing related to anal HPV.

        -  You will have an anoscopy. An anoscopy is an examination of the rectum in which a small
           tube is inserted into the anus to screen, diagnose, and evaluate problems of the anus
           and anal canal. To perform this test, acetic acid is placed on the anus and the area is
           looked at for pre-cancerous areas using a colposcope (an instrument that magnifies the
           cells of the cervix and vagina to allow for direct observation and study of the living
           tissue). The acetic acid is used to help the pre-cancerous areas show up better. If you
           have an abnormal test result, you will be referred to a colorectal specialist so that
           you can be seen and then treated according to the standard of care.

      After the procedures described above are performed, your study participation will be over.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 500 women will take part in this study. Up to 275 will be enrolled at MD Anderson. Up
      to 225 will be enrolled at the Harris Health System.
