    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, multi-site, single-dose, Phase 1 study in up to 29
      adults with severe sickle cell disease (SCD). The study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the LentiGlobin BB305 Drug Product [consisting of autologous CD34+ hematopoietic
      stem cells (HSC) transduced with LentiGlobin BB305 lentiviral vector encoding the human beta
      A-T87Q-globin gene].

      Subject participation for this study will be 2 years post-treatment. Subjects who enroll in
      this study will be asked to participate in a subsequent long-term follow up study that will
      monitor the safety and efficacy of the treatment they receive for up to 13 years
      post-transplant.

    <time_frame>1-24 months post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated by the following:
success and kinetics of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment
safety and tolerability of plerixafor for mobilization
incidence of treatment-related mortality
incidence of mortality through 2 years after drug product infusion
detection of vector-derived replication competent lentivirus (RCL) in any subject
characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to malignancy
monitoring of laboratory parameters and frequency and severity of clinical AEs, as assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical efficacy will be evaluated by comparing the frequency of clinical events secondary to sickle cell disease</measure>
    <time_frame>1-24 months post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be evaluated by the following:
severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). A severe VOC is defined as an episode of pain lasting more than 2 hours severe enough to require care at a medical facility. Priapism that lasts more than 2 hours and requires care at a medical facility is considered a severe VOC
acute chest syndrome events, defined as an acute event with pneumonia-like symptoms and the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate
strokes or transient ischemic attacks</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or older.

             experienced one or more of the following events:

               -  Recurrent severe vaso occlusive crises (VOC) (at least 2 episodes per year in
                  the preceding 2 years or in the 2 years prior to initiation of a regular
                  transfusion program).

                  symptoms and the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate.

             procedure) are eligible if the procedure occurred &gt; 1 year prior to study entry.

          6. Contraindication to anesthesia for bone marrow harvesting.

          7. Any prior or current malignancy or immunodeficiency disorder, except previously
             treated, non-life threatening, cured tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin.

          8. Prior receipt of an allogeneic transplant.

          9. Immediate family member with a known or suspected Familial Cancer Syndrome

         11. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational drug within 30 days
