      Approximately 600 pediatric patients prescribed Humira Injection in usual practice according
      to the approved Korean product label will be registered into this observational study.
      Baseline data will be obtained at enrollment including demographics, underlying diseases and
      complications especially in regard to purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test, chest
      X-ray. At routine visits for Humira Injection administration which will occur according to
      usual medical practice, concomitant medication information and adverse events information
