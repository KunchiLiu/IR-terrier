      The purpose of this study is to check the medical efficacy and economic benefits of
      multidisciplinary care in patients with unexplained medical complaints and consume medical
      services frequently.

      Background:

      Somatic or &quot;medically unexplained&quot; symptoms and syndromes are common and are seen by
      physicians across almost every medical specialty. In many instances, these phenomena can
      cause a great deal of pain and frustration, restrict function and reduce patients' quality
      of life. Despite their frequency and severity, medical personnel often experience a great
      deal of difficulty in coping with such complaints and patients may be shuttled from
      specialist to specialist, often with little or no symptomatic relief and at a great deal of
      expense to the medical system. Many researchers now believe that these seemingly unrelated
      and &quot;unexplained&quot; conditions in fact share common psycho-physiological mechanisms, such as
      being catalyzed as a result of trauma or excessive stress, being mediated by the limbic
      system and affecting inhibitory sensory pathways.

      Purpose of the study:

      Testing the efficacy and cost-efficiency of a holistic multidisciplinary treatment
      methodology for medically unexplained symptoms (MUS).

      Stages of the Study:

        1. Identifying potential participants based on their frequent use of medical services and
           high expense rates. The process will be done using the &quot;Clalit Health Service&quot; database
           and will include 6 primary care clinic in the Be'er Sheva district.

        2. Exclusion of potential candidates suffering from chronic medical illnesses, such as:
           cancer, long-term psychosis, dementia and dialysis patients.

        3. Randomization of potential candidates into two arms. The first arm will be followed via
           the &quot;Clalit Health Service&quot; database with no intervention.

        4. Members of the second arm will be asked if they would be willing to participate in the
           study by their family physicians in the aforementioned community clinics.

        5. Participants who have agreed to join the study will then be referred to the &quot;functional
           neurology&quot; clinic at Soroka UMC where they will be further randomized into one of two
           equal arms (henceforth: the second and third arms of the study).

        6. The second arm will be treated for 3 months by the staff of the &quot;functional neurology&quot;
           clinic at Soroka UMC. This treatment will include an initial visit to the staff
           neurologist and further multidisciplinary treatment as per his decision (the team
           includes a psychologist and a physical therapist as well). The third arm will be
           treated for 3 months by an internal medicine physician on staff at Soroka UMC. This
           treatment will include an initial visit to the physician and further treatment as per
           his decision.

        7. Self-report measures will be collected from the second and third arms of the study at
           their initial randomization, at the end of treatment (3 months) and 6 months after the
           start of treatment.

        8. Expense rates and use of medical services will be evaluated for 6 months prior to the
           start of the intervention and then again at the end of treatment (3 months) and 12
           months after the start of treatment.

      Expected Results

        1. A decrease in expense rates and use of medical services in the intervention group
           (second arm).

        2. An increase in patient satisfaction amongst the intervention group (second arm).

        3. An increase in patient-reported health and quality of life in the intervention group
           (second arm).
