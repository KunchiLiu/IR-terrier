  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MK-8228 for the prevention of
      clinically-significant CMV infection in adult, CMV-seropositive recipients of allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The hypothesis being tested is that MK-8228 is superior
      to placebo in the prevention of clinically-significant CMV infection through 24 weeks after
      transplant.

    <description>MK-8228 oral or intravenous (IV) formulation will be administered once daily for up to 14 weeks after transplant. The dose will be 240 mg once daily for participants receiving concomitant cyclosporin A and 480 mg once daily for participants not receiving cyclosporin A. Intravenous infusion will be administered only to participants who are unable to swallow tablets or who have a condition that may interfere with absorption of the tablets.</description>

          -  Has previously participated in a MK-8228 (letermovir) study

          -  Has, is, or is planning (during the study) to participate in any study involving
