    <textblock>
      This document describes a prospective, multi center, study of the Laminate External Support
      device in brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas. The Laminate product constraints and
      directs the geometrical parameters of the fistula as well as the vascular diameter and
      gradient in the vicinity of the AV shunt. These geometrical constraints direct flow and
      influence hemodynamics, and hence minimize turbulence and promote laminar flow. The device
      is designed to improve short term maturation and long term patency of the fistula. The
      Laminate device is a permanent implant intended for use as a subcutaneous arteriovenous
      conduit support for vascular access.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients referred for creation of a new brachiocephalic fistula who consent to take
             part in the study.
