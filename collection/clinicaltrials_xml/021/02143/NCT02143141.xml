  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are attempting to see if eliminating the amount of long acting spinal
      narcotic during cesarean section delivery will demonstrate pain scores with movement when
      evaluated 24 hours postoperatively as those that receive the standard dosage of spinal
      narcotic when combined with oral acetaminophen or placebo. The investigators also are
      evaluating if there are decreased side effects related to decreased narcotic usage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are randomized on the morning of surgery to receive a standard dose of spinal
      narcotic or to receive no long acting spinal narcotic. The subjects may or may not also
      receive acetaminophen orally postoperatively. Pain scores are done on postoperative day one
      as well as evaluation of potential narcotic side effects such as nausea/vomiting, itching,
      and sedation.
