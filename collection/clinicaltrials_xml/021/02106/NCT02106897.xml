      The primary objective of Parts 1 and 2 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of either
      single-ascending intravenous (IV) doses or a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of BIIB059 in
      healthy volunteers (HV), and a single IV dose in participants with Systemic Lupus
      Erythematosus (SLE). The primary objective of Part 3 is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of multiple SC doses of BIIB059 in healthy volunteers and in participants with
      SLE.

      Secondary objectives of Parts 1 and 2 are as follows: To estimate the PK parameters of
      single-ascending IV doses of BIIB059 in healthy volunteers and a single IV dose of BIIB059
      in participants with SLE; To estimate the PK parameters and bioavailability (F) of a single
      SC dose of BIIB059 in healthy volunteers; To evaluate the immunogenicity of BIIB059
      administered to healthy volunteers and participants with SLE. Secondary objectives of Part 3
      are as follows: To estimate the PK parameters of multiple SC doses of BIIB059 in healthy
      volunteers and in participants with SLE; To evaluate the immunogenicity of BIIB059
      administered SC to healthy volunteers and participants with SLE.
