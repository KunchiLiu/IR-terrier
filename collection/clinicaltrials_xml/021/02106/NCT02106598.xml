  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current imaging devices usually detect cancer prior to surgery. However, these devices
      cannot be used during the surgical procedure to visualize lymph nodes with cancer (called
      &quot;sentinel lymph nodes&quot;). The groups are for head and neck melanoma, gynecologic, and breast
      cancers. As a part of the standard of care, the they will initially undergo imaging of their
      lymph nodes prior to their surgery. Melanoma and breast cancer patients will be injected
      with a radioactive dye around the tumor site, and images will be acquired about 2 hours the
      location of the later using a device to image the dye. For gynecologic cancer patients, they
      will be injected with a indocyanine green in the operating room and then images will be
      acquired soon after. In addition, the investigators will test, for the first time in humans,
      a new, experimental dye-labeled particle (dots), cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots for lymph node
      mapping. This particle, the size of a small protein, will be injected around sites of
      melanoma before or during your surgery to identify diseased nodes using a hand-held camera
      system. The dye-labeled particle can be viewed in tissues that may contain tumor. Based upon
      the clinical diagnosis, the patient may have a procedure called Reverse Lymphatic Mapping,
      which is a new form of sentinel lymph node mapping. The doctor will discuss this with the
      patient. If the patient is undergoing reverse lymphatic mapping, they will have the
      experimental particle injected into their hand or foot (based on their tumor type) and the
      standard of care injection will be injected around the tumor. This will allow the surgeon to
      remove only the lymph nodes that directly link to the tumor. The particles will not treat
      the cancer and any images or information found during this study will not be used for your
      treatment. The information collected may be used to guide the design of future studies to
      detect and/or treat tumors.

    <description>Patient will initially undergo routine imaging 0.5 - 2 hrs after local injection of 99mTc-technetium sulfur colloid of LymphoseekÂ® per the standard procedure. Up to 24 hours prior to surgery or in the operative suite, intradermal, 4-quadrant injections of cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots will be administered as a single or multiple doses about the tumor site gynecologic cancer patients,i ndocyanine green( ICG) will be injected in the OR suite. In patients undergoing reverse lymphatic mapping, &amp; at the discretion of the operating surgeon, ICG &amp; cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots will be injected intraoperatively - one peritumorally &amp; one intradermally within the corresponding ipsilateral extremity. Patient's optical scans will be acquired in the surgical suite using the Quest Spectrum TM portable two-fluorescence channel camera system (f 2.4; 15 frames per second; resolution 50 um) &amp; video monitoring. In the operating room, vital signs will be monitored per routine prior to &amp; after agent administration.</description>
