      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sodium risedronate
      tablets (Benet 17.5 mg Tablets) administered once daily (one tablet per dose) in patients
      with osseous Paget's disease for 48 weeks from baseline in daily medical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This special drug use surveillance was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      sodium risedronate tablets (Benet 17.5 mg Tablets) administered once daily (one tablet per
      dose) in patients with osseous Paget's disease in daily medical practice.

      The usual dosage for adults is 17.5 mg of sodium risedronate administered orally with a
      sufficient volume (approximately 180 mL) of water once daily after waking for 8 consecutive
      weeks. For at least 30 minutes after administration, patients should avoid lying in a supine
      position and taking food, drink (except for water) or other oral drugs.

    <description>The frequencies of all adverse events observed during the observation period will be tabulated by type and seriousness. Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with administration of sodium risedronate whether or not it was considered related to treatment. Among these, events that are considered as having a causal relationship with sodium risedronate are defined as adverse drug reactions.</description>
