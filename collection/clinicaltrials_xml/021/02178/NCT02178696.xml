  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is a highly prevalent, frequently debilitating illness that too often fails
      to respond to currently available treatments such as antidepressant medication. Furthermore,
      randomized controlled trials of antidepressants consistently demonstrate large placebo
      effects. The investigators hypothesize that individual differences in the function of key
      brain circuits underlie the observed variability in clinical responses to both placebo and
      antidepressant medication. This study will test this hypothesis by recruiting
      treatment-seeking volunteers with major depression, with or without comorbid nicotine
      dependence. Volunteers will participate in positron emission tomography (PET) and functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans in the context of a treatment trial in which they
      will receive both placebo and antidepressant medication. A major goal of the study is to
      improve prediction of individual clinical responses in future treatment trials in which
      brain imaging may be unavailable, and to study the mechanisms of antidepressant response in
      Major Depression.

    <description>This arm gets a placebo that they know is a placebo (called inactive), then has 2 scans performed (FMRI and PET), then a 2-3 day washout, and then gets a so-called &quot;active medication&quot; (which is also actually a placebo), and another pair of scans. Following these, participants receive 10 weeks of open-label antidepressant administration (Celexa or alternative as explained in intervention description). First line antidepressant will be Celexa unless not clinically indicated.</description>
