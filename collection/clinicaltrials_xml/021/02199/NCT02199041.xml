  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (HCT), who do not have a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched
      related/sibling donor (MSD), matched unrelated donor (MURD) or killer-immunoglobulin
      receptors (KIR) ligand mismatched haploidentical donor identified, will receive a combined T
      cell depleted (TCD) haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) and unrelated umbilical
      cord blood transplantation (UCBT) using a total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) based preparative
      regimen.

      Primary objective:

        -  To estimate the incidence of donor derived neutrophil engraftment by day +42
           post-transplant for participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing a
           total lymphoid irradiation (TLI)-based hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using a
           T cell depleted (TCI) haploidentical donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donor
           combined with an unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) donor.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Estimate the incidence of malignant relapse, event-free survival (EFS), and overall
           survival (OS) at one-year post-transplantation.

        -  Estimate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease
           (GVHD) in the first 100 days after transplantation.

        -  Estimate the incidence of secondary graft failure transplant related mortality (TRM)
           and transplant related morbidity in the first 100 days after HCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to stem cell infusion, participants will receive a preparative regimen of total
      lymphoid irradiation (TLI), fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and thiotepa to
      prepare their bone marrow. Thereafter, they will receive a hematopoietic cell graft from a
      haploidentical donor and an unrelated umbilical cord blood donor. Post-transplantation
      immunosuppressive treatment will include tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.

    <measure>Rate of neutrophil engraftment</measure>
    <time_frame>Until day 42 post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of neutrophil engraftment by day +42 will be approximated using a Binomial distribution. Neutrophil engraftment is defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery of ≥ 0.5 x 109/L (500/mm3) for three consecutive laboratory values obtained on different days. Date of engraftment is the date of the first of the three consecutive laboratory values.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of malignant relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The estimate of cumulative incidence of relapse will be estimated using Kalbfleisch-Prentice method. Relapse defined as the recurrence of original disease. Death is the competing risk event. The analysis will be implemented using SAS macro (bmacro252-Excel2007\cin).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>One year after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The Kaplan-Meier estimate of EFS with relapse, death due to any cause and graft failure as events along with their standard errors will be calculated using the SAS macro (bmacro251-Excel2007\kme) available in the Department of Biostatistics at St. Jude, where EFS = min (date of last follow-up, date of relapse, date of graft failure, date of death due to any cause) - date of transplant, and all participants surviving at the time of analysis without events will be censored.</description>

    <time_frame>One year after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS with relapse, death due to any cause and graft failure as events along with their standard errors will be calculated using the SAS macro (bmacro251-Excel2007\kme) available in the Department of Biostatistics at St. Jude, where OS = min (date of last follow-up, date of death) - date of HCT and all participants surviving after 1 year post-transplant will be considered as censored.</description>

    <measure>Incidence by severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) in the first 100 days after HCT</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days after transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD will be estimated using Kalbfleisch-Prentice method. Death is the competing risk event. The SAS macro (bmacro252-Excel2007\cin) available in the Department of Biostatistics at St. Jude will be used for such analysis. The severity of acute GVHD and chronic GVHD will be described.
GVHD grade and stage (acute and chronic) will be determined by pre-defined criteria per protocol.</description>

    <time_frame>100 days after transplantation</time_frame>

    <description>The mechanism of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis products). These can then be separated in a magnetic field using an immunomagnetic label specific for the cell type of interest, such as CD3+ human T cells.</description>
