  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot randomized controlled trial which will enroll both subacute (&lt;6 mos)
      and chronic (&gt;6 mos) stroke survivors (n=18 total) with dorsiflexion weakness. The subjects
      will be stratified based on interval post-stroke and baseline level of motor impairment and
      then randomized to Contralaterally Controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (CCNMES)
      versus control. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of 6-weeks of
      lower extremity CCNMES, applied in an anti-phase application, on motor impairment and
      functional mobility to a control group; the effect of interval post-stroke, subacute (early)
      versus chronic (late) post-stroke, will be assessed. The secondary objective is to determine
      the effect of 6-weeks of lower extremity anti-phase CCNMES on functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) cortical activation patterns using an ankle dorsiflexion paradigm. The
      specific use of functional MRI as an outcome measure is to explore a central mechanism for
      between-group differences.

      AIM 1: Determine the effect of lower extremity CCNMES, applied in an anti-phase application,
      on motor impairment and functional mobility in hemiparesis compared to a control group;
      assess the effect of application in the subacute (&lt; 6 mos, early) versus chronic (&gt; 6 mos,
      late) post-stroke period.

      Hypothesis: Subjects randomized to the lower extremity CCNMES group will achieve greater
      improvement in motor impairment and functional mobility as compared to the control group;
      subjects in the subacute post-stroke period will achieve greater improvement than subjects
      in the chronic post-stroke period.

      AIM 2: Demonstrate change in functional MRI activation patterns using an ankle dorsiflexion
      paradigm following the lower extremity anti-phase CCNMES intervention.

      Hypothesis: Subjects randomized to the anti-phase CCNMES group will demonstrate change in
      functional MRI cortical activation patterns which differs from the control group; subjects
      in subacute post-stroke period will demonstrate change in functional MRI activation patterns
      that are distinct from change noted in chronic subjects.

      AIM 3: Define a central mechanism for post-stroke motor and functional recovery associated
      with lower extremity anti-phase CCNMES.

      Hypothesis: Change in functional MRI cortical activation patterns following anti-phase
      CCNMES intervention will correlate with change in motor impairment and functional mobility.

    <measure>Ankle Movement Tracking Error</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline ankle movement tracking error and change from baseline at 6 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle movement tracking is a method of assessing ankle motor control. Output from an electrogoniometer attached to the paretic ankle will be displayed as a cursor on a computer screen, its vertical position corresponding to the degree of ankle dorsiflexion. A rising and falling trace (sinusoid) will scroll across the screen. The subject's task is to try to keep the cursor on or as close to the scrolling trace as possible by voluntarily dorsiflexing the ankle (no stimulation). Three to six trials will be administered after a practice trial.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline active range of motion of ankle and change from baseline at 6 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum voluntary ankle dorsiflexion angle and range of motion (ROM) will be measured using a goniometer applied to the anterior aspect of the foot. Passive ankle ROM will also be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Lower Extremity Motor Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Fugl-Meyer lower extremity motor assessment and change from baseline at 6 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>In the lower limb motor impairment component of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), the subject is asked to make various isolated and simultaneous movements of the hip, knee, and ankle. The specific items of the FMA are graded on a 3-point ordinal scale (0, cannot perform; 1, perform partially; 2, perform fully) and summed to provide a maximum score of 34.</description>

    <measure>Modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile (MEFAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline modified Emory functional ambulation profile and change from baseline at 6 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The MEFAP is a valid and reliable measure of functional ambulation, which measures the time to ambulate through 5 common environmental terrains. Specific tasks include: 1) a 5-m walk on a hard floor, 2) a 5-m walk on a carpeted floor, 3) rising from a chair, a 3-m walk, and return to a seated position, 4) traversing a standardized obstacle course (bricks to step over), 5) ascending and descending set of stairs. Subjects will be asked to perform these tasks at a comfortable and safe rate, with physical assistance as necessary to ensure safety. The five timed subscores are added to derive a summary score.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging and change from baseline at 6 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Functional MRI using a dorsiflexion functional MRI paradigm will be performed. The functional movement task of the functional MRI will be ankle tracking of the paretic lower extremity.
Note: If intrascan head movement for the individual subject cannot be sufficiently minimized to ensure adequate functional MRI images, or if there are confounding technical issues, then the subject will not undergo the pre- and post-treatment functional MRI procedures.</description>

    <description>Contralaterally Controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (CCNMES): CCNMES uses electrical stimulation to move the weaker ankle up and down. The user will control the stimulation using the other (stronger) ankle. A special sock is worn on the stronger ankle. When the stronger ankle is moved, a signal is sent from a sensor on the sock to the electrical stimulator. The stimulator then sends stimulation to the weaker ankle which causes it to move. Sound and light cues coming from the stimulator will tell the user when to move the stronger ankle and when to relax.</description>
