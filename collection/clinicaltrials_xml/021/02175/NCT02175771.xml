  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Best pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of greater than 40% of their predicted normal value.

          2. Patients must have a treatment regimen that includes a short-acting β2 agonist (SABA)
             (albuterol) for use as needed and either an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or an
             ICS/long-acting β2 agonist (LABA) as a preventative treatment for a minimum of 8
             weeks before the SV. Patients currently taking low-dose ICS without LABA are not
             eligible for this study. Patients currently taking low-dose ICS/LABA may only be
             entered into the mid ICS strength. All patients must have been maintained on a stable
             dose of ICS or ICS/LABA for 4 weeks prior to the SV (or pre-SV if necessary) at 1
             qualifying doses

          3. To meet reversibility of disease criteria, the patient must demonstrate a ≥12%
             reversibility of FEV1 (and 200 mL for patients aged18 years and older) within 30
             minutes following 4 inhalations of albuterol at the SV. Historic reversibility within
             the past 12 months of the SV may be used to meet this criterion.

          4. Written informed consent/assent is obtained. For adult patients (aged 18 years and
             older, or as applicable per local regulations), the written informed consent form
             (ICF) must be signed and dated by the patient before conducting any study-related
             procedure. For minor patients (aged 12 to 17 years, or as applicable per local
             regulations), the written ICF must be signed and dated by the parent/legal guardian
             and the written assent form must be signed and dated by the patient (if applicable)
             before conducting any study-related procedure. Note: Age requirements are as
             specified by local regulations.

          5. Outpatient &gt;= 12 years of age on the date of consent/assent. .

          6. Asthma diagnosis: The patient has a diagnosis of asthma as defined by the National
             Institutes of Health (NIH). The asthma diagnosis has been present for a minimum of 3
             months and has been stable (defined as no exacerbations and no changes in medication)
             for at least 30 days before providing informed consent.

          7. The patient is able to perform acceptable and repeatable spirometry.

          8. The patient is able to perform peak expiratory flow (PEF) with a handheld peak flow
             meter.

          9. The patient is able to use a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) device without a spacer
             device and a MDPI device.

         10. The patient is able to withhold (as judged by the investigator) his or her regimen of
             ICS or study drug, and rescue medication for at least 6 hours before the SV and
             before all treatment visits where spirometry is performed.

         11. The patient/parent/legal guardian/caregiver is capable of understanding the
             requirements, risks, and benefits of study participation, and, as judged by the
             investigator, capable of giving informed consent/assent and being compliant with all
             study requirements.

         12. SABAs: All patients must be able to replace their current SABA with
             albuterol/salbutamol HFA inhalation aerosol at the SV for use as needed for the
             duration of the study.

         13. Female patients may not be pregnant, breastfeeding, or attempting to become pregnant.

               -  -Other criteria may apply, please contact the investigator for more information

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a history of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation that is defined

             with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest, or hypoxic seizures.

          2. The patient is pregnant or lactating, or plans to become pregnant during the study
             period or for 30 days after the study .

          3. The patient has participated as a randomized patient in any investigational drug
             study within the 30 days preceding the SV (or prescreening visit, as applicable) or
