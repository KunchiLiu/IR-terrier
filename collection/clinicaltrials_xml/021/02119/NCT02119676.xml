  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if ruxolitinib, in combination with regorafenib,
      is safe and effective in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of an open-label, Part 1 safety run-in (consisting of 1 to 3 cohorts of 9
      subjects each), to confirm the safety of the regorafenib/ruxolitinib combination in subjects
      with relapsed or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). If determined to be
      tolerable, Part 2 will proceed as a randomized, double-blind study evaluating ruxolitinib or
      placebo in combination with regorafenib in subjects with relapsed or refractory metastatic
      CRC previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and/or irinotecan based
      chemotherapy, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy and if Kirsten rat
      sarcoma (KRAS) wild type an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy.

      Subjects in the safety run-in will receive open-label ruxolitinib and regorafenib; for the
      randomized, double-blind portion of the study all subjects will receive regorafenib and
      either ruxolitinib or placebo in a 1:1 blinded manner. Treatment for all subjects will
      consist of repeating 28-day cycles. Regorafenib will be self-administered for the first 21
      days of each cycle, and ruxolitinib/placebo will be self-administered during the entire
      28-day cycle. Treatment cycles will continue as long as the regimen is tolerated, and the
      subject does not meet the discontinuation criteria. When subjects discontinue regorafenib,
      ruxolitinib or placebo they will remain in the study and be followed for subsequent
      treatment regimens which are initiated and survival.
