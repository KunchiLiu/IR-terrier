  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, in which
      approximately 270 subjects with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who
      have failed or were intolerant to first-line chemotherapy will be randomized (1:1) to one of
      the following treatment groups:

        -  Treatment A (N = 135): Capecitabine + ruxolitinib

        -  Treatment B (N = 135): Capecitabine + placebo

      Treatment will consist of repeating 21-day cycles. Capecitabine will be self-administered
      for the first 14 days of each cycle, and ruxolitinib/placebo will be self-administered
      during the entire cycle. Treatment for all subjects will continue as long as the regimen is
      tolerated, and the subject does not meet discontinuation criteria. Subjects who discontinue
      treatment will continue to be followed for subsequent anticancer treatments and survival.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The safety committee found no safety issues but recommended halting the study based on a lack
    of efficacy in a similar trial. The sponsor terminated the trial.
