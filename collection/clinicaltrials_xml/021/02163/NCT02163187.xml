  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a medical device/implant (InterStimTM) will
      help patients to have more normal bowel movements. The InterStimTM device is a
      neuromodulating device. Neuromodulation is a way of changing the activity of the nervous
      system by using electrical stimulation. InterStimTM is FDA approved to help people who have
      a hard time controlling their bowl movements. This is called fecal incontinence.The device
      is placed near a nerve root in the lower back. It works in a manner similar to a pacemaker
      by releasing electrical stimulation that triggers the S3 nerve root. When being placed, it
      is initially tested to make sure it will work using a temporary wire and then, if
      successful, the device is permanently implanted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind randomized crossover study. After providing written informed consent,
      eligible patients will undergo an initial stimulation procedure with a temporary lead (Step
      1 Wire Stimulation). The simulation is performed to determine efficacy of the device before
      a permanent implant is placed. This stimulation takes place over a period of 7-14 days (+/-3
      days). Because this procedure is done in the OR, this window of time allows for optimization
      of the device and coordination of operating room schedules. This is the time period that has
      been used in prior trials. Typically bowel improvement has been seen relatively quickly, so
      the range should not affect our assessment of BFI.

      After the Wire Implantation has occurred, patients will be evaluated over the next 7-14 days
      (+/- 3 days) and will complete the BFI questionnaire. If BFI improvement is &lt; than or = to 4
      points the wire will be removed in the operating room, the patient will be offered standard
      of care, and the patient will no longer be part of the study. Based on our prior data, we
      would like to give as many patients as possible the opportunity for enrollment and as a
      result we have chosen a 4 point BFI change as minimum criteria for response. Our group has
      seen that a change in the BFI around 5-6 is clinically significant, but we will lower this
      threshold slightly. If a patient's BFI improves by ≥ 4 points, the patient will proceed to
      the randomized phase (Step 2-Implantation) of the study.

      Patients who proceed to Step 2- Implantation, they will return to the operating room for the
      implantation of the permanent device. While in the operating room they will be randomly
      assigned to either having the device stimulation on (Group A) or device stimulation off
      (Group B) for first 4 weeks (+/-3 days). Patients will return to clinic 2 weeks later to
      cross over to the other arm (Step 3-Crossover) and the device stimulation will be set to on
      or off. Patients will come back to clinic within 7 days (+/- 7 days) after Crossover for
      device check and optimization.

    <description>Bowel function will be assessed by using the MSK BFI. We have chosen the BFI because it is widely endorsed to assess the clinical problem that these patients have. The BFI is a 19 item instrument to which a patient responds using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from Always to Never.</description>

    <description>QOL and urinary continence will be assessed at the start of the study (Baseline), after initial stimulation (Step 1-Wire Stimulation), and at each point in the crossover trial (Step 2-Implantation and Step 3-Crossover). Graphical displays will be used to explore data distributions of all secondary outcome measures over time. We assume no period effect and will evaluate the treatment effect using the paired t-test (and a repeated measures ANOVA to include other covariates in the model) for each of our main outcome measures, EuroQOL5, FIQOL, LARS and Bladder function. We will test for period effect to confirm this.</description>
