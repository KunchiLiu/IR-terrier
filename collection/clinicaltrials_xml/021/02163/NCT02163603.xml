  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developmental dislocation of the hip is a common disease in children, and its incidence in
      China is about 9 ‰.The pathological changes of it is complex. The reluxation , subluxation
      and residual deformity and other complications are relatively common after treatment. The
      X-ray appears great acetabular index and wide medial gap , small central-edge angle. As
      there is no effective methods for treating such complications , investigators conducted this
      trial to find and prove optimal intervention time and treatment programs.
