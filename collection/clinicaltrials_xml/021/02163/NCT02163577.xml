  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UX023-CL201 is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, dose finding, Phase 2 study. The study
      will be conducted in prepubescent children aged 5-12 years with XLH to assess the
      pharmacodynamics and safety of KRN23 administered via subcutaneous injections monthly (every
      4 weeks) or biweekly (every 2 weeks) for a total of 64 weeks. The study consists of a
      16-week individual dose Titration Period, followed by a 48-week Treatment Period. The study
      will enroll approximately 50 pediatric patients with XLH and radiographic evidence of bone
      disease. Subjects will need to discontinue oral phosphate and vitamin D metabolite therapy
      prior to randomization and throughout the duration of the study.

          7. Willing to provide access to prior medical records for the collection of historical
             growth, biochemical and radiographic data, and disease history.

          8. Provide written or verbal assent (if possible) and written informed consent by a
