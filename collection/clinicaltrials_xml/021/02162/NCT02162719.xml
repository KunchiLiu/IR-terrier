  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study will estimate the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel compared with placebo combined with
      paclitaxel in participants with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative
      breast cancer (mTNBC), as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) in all participants
      and in participants with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-low tumors.
