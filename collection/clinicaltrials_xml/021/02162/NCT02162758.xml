    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of dexlansoprazole QD and BID dosing on the
      recurrence of intestinal metaplasia (IM) in subjects who achieved complete eradication of
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) following radiofrequency ablation
      (RFA).

      The drug being tested in this study is called dexlansoprazole. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the effect of 12 months of treatment with dexlansoprazole 60 mg QD or
      dexlansoprazole 60 mg BID on the recurrence of IM in participants who have achieved complete
      eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM) and dysplasia (CED) with Radiofrequency Ablation
      (RFA). The study will enroll approximately 150 patients. Participants will be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Dexlansoprazole 60 mg once a day and placebo (this is a capsule that looks like the
           study drug but has no active ingredient) once a day

        -  Dexlansoprazole 60 mg twice a day. All participants will be asked to take one capsule
           twice a day at the same time each day throughout the study.

      This randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel group trial will be conducted in North
      America. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 13 months. Participants will
      make 5 visits to the clinic, and will undergo a safety follow-up assessment 30 days after
      the last dose of study drug.
