  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propeller Health is collaborating with Walgreens Pharmacies, the City of Louisville,
      Qualcomm Life and other local partners to carry out a focused demonstration project that
      will evaluate the effectiveness of the Propeller Health approach to asthma management while
      exploring means to use real-time data on asthma exacerbations in a public health setting.
      The Asthma Data Innovation Demonstration Project (ADID) will use wireless sensor technology
      to develop spatial and temporal data on the use of rescue inhalers by 300 study subjects
      with asthma in the Louisville metropolitan area. Propeller Health will process these data to
      support two general strategies.

      Asthma self management: Rescue inhaler actuation data will be compiled into individualized
      feedback reports to support asthma self management. Propeller Health will combine
      information on individual rescue inhaler actuations with evidence-based asthma management
      tips into real-time reports that will be provided to subjects. ADID staff will evaluate any
      resulting improvements in asthma control that may be based on this information. Subjects may
      share reports with their healthcare providers.

      Municipal purposes: The second strategy is to provide aggregated and de-identified, spatial
      and temporal asthma rescue inhaler actuation data to City personnel and authorized public
      health researchers in Louisville. These data will show the times and locations of the use of
      rescue inhalers by the 300 study subjects throughout the greater Louisville area. ADID staff
      will work with City personnel and researchers to investigate how this unprecedented level of
      detailed information on exacerbations can be used best to increase public awareness of
      environmental triggers while supporting public health surveillance efforts around
      respiratory diseases.

    <description>The Propeller Health sensor permits the capture of objective time and location data on each use of rescue inhalers, and thus represents a potential improvement over patient self-reporting. Actuation data for rescue medication will be automatically collected and processed by Propeller Health, and the frequency and timing of each subject's rescue inhaler actuations over the term of the study will be used as components of a measure of control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Asthma Control Test scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at study exit, up to 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ACT is a validated instrument designed to assess asthma control. The ACT will be embedded in surveys completed by subjects at intake and again at study exit. Separate versions are provided for subjects over the age of eleven and for children under the age of 12. Scores above 19 indicate asthma that is well controlled. All else equal, we anticipate that ACT scores will increase over the term of the study.</description>

    <description>After the baseline control period is completed at one month, all participants will continue using their sensors, and will begin to receive the full intervention for 12 months. The intervention includes access to all of the participant's sensor-collected data, trends, educational information and weekly reports. The 13-month term was chosen in order to eliminate any seasonal variation in asthma exacerbations.</description>

    <description>The Propeller Health system works through the provision of information to patients and their providers. With the Propeller Health sensor device in place, each actuation of a patient's rescue inhaler is recorded with an automatic time stamp; in many circumstances, the location at which the device is actuated is also captured and recorded. Actuation data are then securely transmitted to Propeller Health where events and an assessment of asthma control can be viewed in secure online interfaces. The information is also compiled into individual reports that are returned to the patient and his or her provider. Patients also receive customized suggestions for asthma management based on their actuation history.</description>
