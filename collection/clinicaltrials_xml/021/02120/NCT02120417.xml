    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial comparing the overall
      survival of women with advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer who receive
      treatment with capecitabine in combination with ruxolitinib versus those who receive
      treatment with capecitabine alone.
