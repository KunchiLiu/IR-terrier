    <textblock>
      Background : Brain vulnerability is particularly marked in preterm neonates and has
      long-term consequences. Unlike lesions affecting other organs, those that affect the brain
      can currently not 'be repaired' by producing new cells. However, exeprience-driven brain
      plasticity allows the brain to reorganise its connections to compensate (at least partially)
      the effects of an injury.

      Purpose : To evaluate the influence of NOBEPPI sensorimotor stimulation on cognitive, motor
      and language development at 18 months of corrected age in children born &lt;32 weeks' gestation
      or with birth weight &lt;1500 g.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm and very low birth weight infants are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders,
      including cerebral palsy, sensory impairment and intellectual disability. Several early
      intervention approaches have been designed in the hope of optimising neurological
      development in this context. These programmes show high variety in the type of intervention,
      frequency of sessions and total duration of the intervention, as well as the duration of
      follow-up. Depending on studies, there is an inconstant benefit on cognitive and behavioural
      development in the first 2 years and preschool age. According to the most recent studies, it
      seems important that the intervention takes into account parental mental health, focuses on
      parent-child interactions and lasts sufficiently long.

      This prospective randomized-controlled clinical study has been designed to evaluate the
      effects of an additional parent-administed programme to the usual care in this developmental
      risk population,.

      The intervention is carried out at home by parents coached by physiotherapist from term-age
      to 6 months of corrected age. The monitoring and evaluation period for all infants
      participating in the study ends at 18 months of corrected age and includes clinical,
      neurodevelopmental, parental stress and neurophysiological assessments.

    <description>' Stimulation ' Infants group will receive NOBEPPI ( Norwegian -Belgian Physical Programme for Preterm Infants).
This sensorimotor stimulation programme is administered at home by parents (trained and monitored by a physical therapist), once a day between term-age and 6 months of corrected age.
In addition, these infants undergo systematic monitoring for preterm and infants born with low birth weight as organized in Belgium (&quot; INAMI convention &quot;) and in France (&quot; regional health agency &quot;).</description>
