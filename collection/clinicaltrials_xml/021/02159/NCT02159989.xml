      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of sapanisertib and
      ziv-aflibercept in treating patients with solid tumors that have come back and have spread
      to another place in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Sapanisertib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Ziv-aflibercept may stop the growth of solid tumors by blocking the growth of new blood
      vessels necessary for tumor growth. Giving sapanisertib with ziv-aflibercept may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability, determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommend
      a phase II dose of the combination of MLN0128 (TAK-228) (sapanisertib) with ziv-aflibercept
      in patients with advanced cancers refractory to standard therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To give early indication of efficacy by evaluation of tumor size. II. To evaluate v-akt
      murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt)/mechanistic target of rapamycin
      (serine/threonine kinase) (mTOR) signaling and adaptive responses; testing phosphorylation
      levels of biomarkers such as, but not limited to, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1
      and 2, AKT and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1)
      following treatment with MLN0128 (TAK-228) and ziv-aflibercept in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and biopsy samples during expansion cohort.

      III. To determine change in blood flow parameter of angiogenesis by assessment with dynamic
      contrast enhanced-computed tomography (DCE-CT) during expansion cohort.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-4, 9-11, 16-18, and
      23-25 and ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
