      Evaluation of efficacy and safety of testosterone enanthate administered subcutaneously
      using an auto-injector

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate if testosterone enanthate administered subcutaneously once each
      week by an auto injector to men with low testosterone can raise their levels into the normal
      range.

      The study will investigate the ability to adjust testosterone enanthate dose levels using
      single point blood concentrations.

      Safety and tolerability of testosterone administration will be evaluated along with the
      patient's ability to use the auto injector and follow the instructions for auto injector
      use.

      Patient satisfaction with sexual functioning will also be assessed during this 52 week
      study.
