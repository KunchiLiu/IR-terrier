  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the amount of ertapenem in the blood over time
      between hemodialysis session.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a hemodialysis session, subject will be administered ertapenem and the amount of
      ertapenem in the blood will be measured at seven time periods before the initiation of the
      next hemodialysis session.
