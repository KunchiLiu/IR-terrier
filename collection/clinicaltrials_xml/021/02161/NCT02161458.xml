  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimers disease (AD) is a devastating illness, estimated to affect 5 million patients in
      the United States alone and projected to increase dramatically over the next decades as the
      population ages unless preventive measures can be developed. The investigators have
      preliminary evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants
      lower the amount of amyloid plaques in the human brain. The interventions now propose to
      study the effects of an SSRI (escitalopram) on levels of amyloid beta peptide (the major
      constituent of the plaques) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cognitively normal older
      adults. The investigators will measure CSF Amyloid Beta levels before and after two weeks of
      treatment with escitalopram using a double blind placebo-controlled study design with
      approximately 30 cognitively normal participants, age 65-85, with a Clinical Dementia Rating
      scale, [CDR] = 0. They will be recruited from the community. Participants will be randomized
      (approximately 15 per group). Participants will have three office visits: the first visit
      will be for screening and consent and participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive
      escitalopram or placebo for two weeks; the second and the third visits will be for lumbar
      puncture (LP) and CSF analysis. Each LP visit will take about 2 hours. The second LP will
      occur two weeks after the first LP. At each LP visit, approximately 1Â½ tablespoons of blood
      and 4 teaspoons of CSF will be obtained. Participants randomized to escitalopram will take
      10 mg escitalopram for 5 days, then take 20 mg escitalopram for the remainder of the two
      week exposure period, and then taper down to 10mg for 3 days. The current proposal will test
      whether clinically relevant doses of an SSRI reduce CSF levels of Amyloid Beta in healthy
      older human participants. The investigators hypothesize that compared to placebo,
      participants receiving escitalopram will show significantly lower Amyloid Beta levels in the
      second CSF sample.
