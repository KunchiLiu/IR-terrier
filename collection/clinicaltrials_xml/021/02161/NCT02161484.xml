  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of adding a single
      shot parasacral (sciatic) nerve block to a continuous lumbar plexus block in patients
      undergoing total hip replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study is intended to assess the efficacy of placing a parasacral (sciatic)
      nerve block in addition to a lumbar plexus block for postoperative analgesia following total
      hip arthroplasty. Although the placement of a lumbar plexus block alone has become accepted
      as the standard of care at UPMC for postoperative analgesia following total hip
      arthroplasty, the addition of a parasacral (sciatic) nerve block may provide the advantage
      of blocking the superior gluteal nerve and nerve to the quadratus femoris which both supply
      small articular sensory branches to the posterior hip capsule.

    <description>Lumbar plexus nerve block placement and activation: After subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetic, 20 mL of Ropivacaine 0.2% will be injected; the catheter will be introduced for 5 cm past the needle tip and secured with steri strips and tegaderm. In PACU, the catheter will be connected to a pump of 0.0625% bupivacaine at 5 - 10 mL per hour at the discretion of the Acute Interventional Perioperative Pain Service (AIPPS). Additional 5mL boluses of 0.0625% bupivacaine will be given on demand once per hour prn.
A single shot parasacral (sciatic) nerve block will then be place under the ultrasound guidance. Ropivacaine 0.2% 9 ml will be injected.</description>
