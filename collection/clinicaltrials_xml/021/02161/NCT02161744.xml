      The purpose of this study is: 1.- to assess the safety and tolerability of autologous
      adipose derived stem cells (aADSC) administered intravenously in patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease, and 2.- to assess if this therapy results in less decrease of
      lung function parameters (FEV1, FEV1/FVC and 6 min walking distance) compared with a control
      baseline of 6 weeks.

      Patients will be followed up for 12 months after the therapy.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase I open- label single-dose study in subjects with significant
      COPD. This is an expanded safety cohort. The investigators will enroll a minimum of 60
      subjects. 6 week data of FEV1, FEV1/FVC, DLCO and 6 min walking distance values will be
      collected in all patients who are enrolled in the study (Baseline and 6 weeks after). Prior
      to the stem cell treatment, the patient will be assessed for 6 weeks by pulmonary function
      tests and 6 min walk tests. Then, patients will receive the infusion of stromal vascular
      fraction cells containing the aADSC (single intravenous dose). The standard therapy of COPD
      patients will not be interrupted during the duration of the study. Safety will be monitored
      on an ongoing basis, and an interim safety review will be conducted by the Investigator(s)
      and Sponsor after the first 20 patients have been enrolled and treated.
