    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this randomized controlled trial are to evaluate efficacy potential of
      SPEEDI at enhancing reaching and play based problem solving compared to infants receiving
      usual care. The secondary aim is to assess the efficacy potential of SPEEDI to impact motor
      and cognitive development as assessed using commonly used clinical outcome measures. The
      exploratory aims are to assess the impact of SPEEDI on parent child interactions and feeding
      skills. The findings will provide crucial initial efficacy estimates to be used in a larger
      definitive clinical trial of SPEEDI.
