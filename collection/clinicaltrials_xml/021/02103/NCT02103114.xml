  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the administration of ATIII during the
      intra-operative period results in improved anticoagulation for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
      and an attenuation of the activation of the coagulation cascade, as represented by a
      decrease in fibrin degradation products. The investigators believe this benefit would extend
      into the post-operative period resulting in a decreased incidence of thrombosis generation,
      as represented by a decrease in fibrin degradation products in the ICU period.

    <description>If the Activated clotting time (ACT) is below the goal of 480 seconds the patient will first be given an additional dose of 200u/kg of heparin. If the patient's ACT remains below 480 seconds, they will be given 20ml/kg of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP). The above dose of heparin and FFP will be repeated until an ACT of greater than 480 seconds is achieved.
If Preoperative ATIII functional assay level is less than 70% - patients would be enrolled and randomized to either Placebo (normal saline) or ATIII. Intraoperatively- (correcting to 100%) according to the following formula:
Units required = ((100%- baseline ATIII level*%) X body weight)/1.4
expressed as a % normal level based on functional ATIII assay</description>
