  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney damage is a major complication of current antirejection medicines used in
      transplantation. An increasing number of brittle diabetics are successfully receiving a
      pancreas transplant. One of the challenges following pancreas transplant is that a patient
      can develop kidney damage from one of their antirejection medicines, tacrolimus. The
      objective of this study is to substitute a new antirejection medicine which does not cause
      kidney damage, belatacept for tacrolimus in patients that have developed signs of tacrolimus
      related kidney damage to slow the progression of kidney disease.

      Nephrotoxicity is a major complication of current immunosuppression regimens used in
      transplantation. Pancreas transplantation has been increasedly performed to manage labile
      diabetes mellitus during the last few decades and survival rates of pancreatic grafts are
      improving. One of the challenges that is faced following pancreas transplantation alone are
      pathologic changes from diabetes frequently seen in native kidneys in the pancreas
      transplant recipients. High levels of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) have been identified as
      risk factors for decline in kidney function and progression to end-stage renal disease. The
      objective of this trial is to take subjects who have biopsy proven CNI toxicity off of their
      CNI and begin belatacept, which is not a CNI.

      The hypothesis is by switching the pancreas transplant subject with documented CNI kidney
      toxicity to belatacept will slow the progression of chronic kidney disease.
