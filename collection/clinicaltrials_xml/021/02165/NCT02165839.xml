      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S):

      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of brief behavioral therapy versus control
      condition that accounts for time and attention (nutrition education) in the treatment of
      insomnia in humans.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be female and have a diagnosis of Breast Cancer (Stage I-IIIA).

          -  Be scheduled for planned cancer treatment (e.g. chemotherapy or biologics such as
             herceptin).

          -  Have at least 6 weeks of cancer treatment (e.g. chemotherapy or biologics such as
             herceptin) remaining.

          -  Be at least 21 years of age.

          -  Be able to understand written and spoken English.

          -  Report sleep disturbance of 8 or greater on the ISI, and report insomnia that began
             or got worse with diagnosis of cancer or treatment with chemotherapy (to exclude
             pre-existing, chronic insomnia).

          -  Have a Karnofsky score &gt;= 70 to ensure that patients are able to participate in
             intervention and assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Have an unstable self-reported medical or psychiatric illness (Axis I - current or
             within the last 5 years).

          -  Be currently pregnant or nursing (patients are monitored for pregnancy during
             chemotherapy and pregnant women in the first trimester are not administered
             chemotherapy. Therefore, pregnancy status of women will be known prior to the
             entrance to the study).

          -  Have a history of substance abuse or meet criteria for current alcohol abuse or
             dependence

          -  Have a self-reported history of sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome (RLS)

          -  Self-report or have a medical record of an unstable comorbid medical or psychiatric
             condition that would make it unsafe or impossible to adhere to the study protocol

          -  Are unable or unwilling to discontinue anxiolytics within 4 hours of education
             sessions

          -  Have irregular heartbeats or arrhythmia (self-reported or in the medical record)
