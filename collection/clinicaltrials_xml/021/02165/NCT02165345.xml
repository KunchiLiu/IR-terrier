    <textblock>
      This open-label extension of the JIGSAW studies (WA28117 [NCT01904279] and WA28118
      [NCT01904292]) is designed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of subcutaneous
      (SC) tocilizumab treatment in participants with polyarticular-course and systemic juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis (pJIA and sJIA). Participants from the 2 JIGSAW studies will continue
      to receive 162 milligrams (mg) of SC tocilizumab with treatment schedule according to
      arthritis subtype and body weight. Participants will receive the treatment until commercial
      availability of the drug or for a maximum of 3 years, whichever is earlier.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Completion of either of the JIGSAW studies, study WA28117 (for participants with
             pJIA) or study WA28118 (for participants with sJIA)

          -  Adequate disease control with the use of SC tocilizumab, as assessed by the
             investigator

          -  For participants of reproductive potential: agreement to remain abstinent or use of
             effective contraception as defined by the study protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior discontinuation of SC tocilizumab because of inadequate clinical response
             during participation in a JIGSAW study

          -  Poorly controlled disease (in opinion of treating physician) despite treatment with
             SC tocilizumab in the JIGSAW study

          -  Prior discontinuation of intravenous tocilizumab because of inadequate clinical
             response or safety events (including hypersensitivity)

          -  Therapy with biologic agents (except tocilizumab) in the period between completion of
             the JIGSAW study and screening for the current study

          -  Concurrent treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (including
             methotrexate), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and oral
             corticosteroids is permitted at the discretion of the investigator

          -  Any significant concurrent medical or surgical conditions or findings that would
             jeopardize the participant's safety or ability to complete the study, including but
             not limited to disease of the nervous, renal, hepatic, cardiac, pulmonary, gastric,
             or endocrine system or any infection

          -  History of alcohol, drug, or chemical abuse within 6 months prior to screening

          -  History of atypical tuberculosis (TB) or active TB requiring treatment within 2 years
             prior to screening

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus infection or other acquired forms of immune
             compromise or inborn conditions characterized by a compromised immune system

          -  Clinical signs or symptoms of acute or chronic viral hepatitis or chronic autoimmune
             hepatitis arising since enrollment in the JIGSAW study

          -  History of concurrent serious gastrointestinal disorders, such as ulcer or
             inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or other symptomatic
             lower gastrointestinal conditions

          -  History of or current cancer or lymphoma

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), defined
             with the use of age-specific standards

             aminotransferase [AST] or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), lowering of neutrophil
             count, or thrombocytopenia attributed to tocilizumab use by investigator at
             screening, the participant may be enrolled; however, the initial tocilizumab dose may
             be delayed to adhere to the protocol risk mitigation strategy or per the
             investigator's clinical judgment
