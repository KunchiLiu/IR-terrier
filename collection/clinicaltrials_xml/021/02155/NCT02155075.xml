  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging (3D MIRA) is a new infrared imaging
      technology using the Real Imager 8 (RI8) developed by Real Imaging. This technology
      generates 3D metabolic maps of the breast and based on sophisticated machine learning
      technology, provides objective risk assessment for the presence of malignant tumor in the
      breast. The procedure is non-invasive, comfortable and does not involve ionizing radiation.
      It is based on acquiring infrared images of the breast. Those images are processed and
      analyzed by computers to provide the objective risk assessment.

      The technology is intended to be used as a screening tool for breast cancer and emerges as
      highly useful in women for whom screening mammography is sub-optimal, such as women with
      dense breast. 3D MIRA is unaffected by breast density and is therefore ideal for evaluating
      patients with mammographically dense breasts.

      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the ability of this novel technology to
      detect breast cancer in women.
