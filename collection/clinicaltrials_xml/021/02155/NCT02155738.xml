  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether preoperative IV Acetaminophen reduces
      postoperative pain and narcotic consumption in women undergoing surgical repair of pelvic
      organ prolapse.

    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial of IV Acetaminophen compared to placebo will evaluate the
      effect of preoperative IV Acetaminophen on postoperative pain scores and narcotic
      requirements in women undergoing surgical repair of pelvic organ prolapse. 204 women will
      randomly receive 1000 mg of IV Acetaminophen or saline preoperatively within 30 minutes of
      surgical incision. Subjects will be offered narcotic and non-narcotic pain medications as
      needed during the postoperative period. Visual analogue pain scales (VAS) will be obtained
      at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours postoperatively. Narcotic consumption will be recorded in
      morphine-equivalents. We hypothesize that women receiving IV Acetaminophen will have lower
      VAS scores and decreased narcotic requirements compared to controls.
