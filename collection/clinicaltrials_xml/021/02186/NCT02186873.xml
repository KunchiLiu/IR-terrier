  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravenously (administration of a
      fluid into the vein) administered golimumab 2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) in participants
      with active ankylosing spondylitis (chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that
      involves the sacroiliac joints, and often the axial skeleton, entheses, and peripheral
      joints).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect) study of
      golimumab compared with placebo in participants with active ankylosing spondylitis. The
      study comprises of 4 phases: Screening phase (up to 6 weeks), Double-blind
      placebo-controlled phase (Week 0 to Week 16), Active treatment phase (Week 16 to Week 52),
      and Safety follow-up phase (8 weeks from last study drug administration). Total duration of
      the study will be 60 weeks per participant. Eligible Participants will be randomly assigned
      to either Treatment group 1: Placebo or Treatment group 2: Golimumab. Participants
      randomized to Placebo group, will receive intravenous infusions of placebo at Weeks 0, 4 and
      12. At Week 16, all participants receiving placebo will begin receiving intravenous
      infusions of golimumab (2 mg/kg) at Weeks 16, 20 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 52.
      Participants randomized to Golimumab group, will receive intravenous infusions of golimumab
      2 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 4 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 52. At Week 16, participants
      randomized to golimumab group will receive a placebo infusion to maintain the blind. The
      efficacy will be assessed primarily by measuring percentage of participants who achieve a 20
      percent improvement from baseline in the assessment in ankylosing spondylitis (ASAS) at Week
      16. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>A 20 percent (%) improvement in response according to the criteria of ASAS International Working Group is defined as; Improvement of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20% from baseline and absolute improvement from baseline of at least 1 on a 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) scale in at least 3 of the following 4 domains: Patient's global assessment of disease activity (0 to 10 cm; 0=very well, 10=very poor), Total back pain (0 to 10 cm; 0=no pain, 10=most severe pain), Function (self-assessment represented as a mean (0 to 10 cm; 0=easy to 10=impossible) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to the participant's functional anatomy and 2 of which relate to a participant's ability to cope with everyday life, Inflammation (0 to 10 cm; 0=none, 10=very severe); and absence of deterioration (worsening of &gt;=20% and at least 1 on a 0 to 10 cm scale) from baseline in the potential remaining domain.</description>

    <description>An ASAS 40 response is defined as &gt;=40% improvement in 3 of 4 domains: Patient's global assessment of disease activity (0 to 10 cm; 0=very well, 10=very poor), Total back pain (0 to 10 cm; 0=no pain, 10=most severe pain), Function (self-assessment represented as a mean (0 to 10 cm; 0=easy to 10=impossible) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to the participant's functional anatomy and 2 of which relate to a participant's ability to cope with everyday life, Inflammation (0 to 10 cm; 0=none, 10=very severe) with an absolute improvement of at least 2 units on a 0 to 10 cm scale, and no deterioration in the remaining domain.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least 50 Percent Improvement From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI is a self-assessment tool to determine disease activity using a VAS of 0-10 cm (0=none and 10=very severe) participant's answered 6 questions measuring fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain, enthesitis, and morning stiffness. The final BASDAI score calculates the individual assessments for a final score range of 0 to 10 cm; 0=best and 10=worst.</description>
