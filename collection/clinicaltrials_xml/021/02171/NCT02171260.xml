    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of eribulin mesylate in pediatric patients with recurrent or
      refractory solid tumors (excluding CNS), including lymphomas. Eribulin mesylate will be
      administered intravenously, once per day on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. This study aims
      to determine the MTD and/or the RP2D of this regimen in Part A1 (patients greater than or
      equal to 12 months and less than 18 years). Part A2 will enroll infants (greater than 6
      months and less than 12 months) one dose level behind the dose level at which patients in
      Part A1 are enrolling, in order to maximize safety for infant subjects. Additionally, this
      study aims to describe the toxicities and the pharmacokinetics of eribulin mesylate when
      administered to children. In a preliminary manner, the antitumor effect of eribulin mesylate
      will also be described.
