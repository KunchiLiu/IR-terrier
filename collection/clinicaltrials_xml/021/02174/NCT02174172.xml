    <textblock>
      This global, multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      MPDL3280A in combination with other immune-modulating therapies in the treatment of selected
      advanced or metastatic malignancies. The MPDL3280A plus ipilimumab arm (Arm A) will focus
      primarily on patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The MPDL3280A plus interferon
      alfa-2b arm (Arm B) will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic RCC and melanoma.
      MPDL3280A will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks (q3w).
