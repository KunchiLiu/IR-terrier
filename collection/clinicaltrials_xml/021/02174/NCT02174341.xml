      This test is to be collected during the dengue outbreak samples, including samples back in
      the past and forward to close the case, investigating the prevalence of serum Chikungunya
      virus infection, and against those suspected dengue fever, Chikungunya disease-related tests
      conducted to clarify dengue and Chikungunya disease of clinical judgment, rapid method to
      detect Chikungunya virus and then develop.

      During the execution of this project was ended March 1, 2012 to December 31, 2015, is
      expected to gather 300 suspected dengue infection, of whom 150 dengue-negative test results,
      test results of 150 dengue positive. And closed the case into prospective and retrospective
      analysis of the last sample into two parts.

      Case closed after part of a prospective analysis of the study, subjects were required to
      complete consent forms and collect 20 ml blood samples, blood samples will be checked to
      identify dengue and Chikungunya disease associated serum antigen-antibody reaction , PCR
      (polymerase chain reaction) test and sequence analysis and pathogen identification and
      separation, in order to identify the source of infection difference. In addition,
      retrospective analysis of the last part of the specimen, sucked &quot;after the health of the
      host track dengue infection, host immune regulation changes, and possible interactions with
      viral hepatitis&quot; (KMUH-IRB-960195) collected by the inspection plan body, the number of
      samples included in the plan to close the case, and contact with the subjects, changes to
      inform the content of the plan to re-sign the consent form.
