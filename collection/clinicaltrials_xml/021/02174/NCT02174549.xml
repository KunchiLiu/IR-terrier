    <textblock>
      This phase 1 study is to determine the optimal dose and tolerability of a hypoxia-activating
      agent, tirapazamine, when it is combined with embolization in liver cancer. Liver cancer
      patients who are Child-Pugh score A, suitable for embolization with tumor no more than 4
      nodules are eligible. Tirapazamine will be given by intravenous infusion in the first two
      cohorts and then switched to intra-arterial injection before embolization in subsequent
      cohorts. Treatment effect is evaluated by MRI based on modified RECIST criteria. Repeat
      treatment is necessary only if disease progression. Each patient is allowed to have up to 6
      treatments in a 18-month period.

      The study is a 3+3 design for dose escalation. Each cohort will have 3-6 patients based on
      tolerability. Patients will receive escalated doses of tirapazamine until maximally
      tolerated dose. Embolization is performed per standard practice using Lipiodol and Gelfoam
      under X-ray guidance. Once a suitable dose is determined, an expansion cohort of 15 patients
      will be treated with the recommended phase 2 dose to determine preliminary efficacy.
      Depending on the dose escalation, there will be 23-63 patients enrolled in the study. All
      patients will be admitted into hospital on the day before embolization, and post-treatment
      observation will be done in hospital until their liver function tests show improvement
      before they are discharged from hospital. Adverse events are evaluated by CTCAE vs. 4.0 and
      efficacy is evaluated by MRI using modified RECIST criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of HCC &gt; 10 mm with a characteristic 4-phase CT or dynamic
             contrast enhanced MRI finding showing intense arterial uptake followed by &quot;washout&quot;
