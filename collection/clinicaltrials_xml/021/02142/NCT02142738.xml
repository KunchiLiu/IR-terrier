  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study to assess pembrolizumab (MK-3475/SCH 900475) compared
      to standard of care (SOC) platinum-based chemotherapies in the treatment of participants
      with previously untreated stage IV, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) strong expressing
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The primary hypothesis of this study is that
      participants with PD-L1 strong NSCLC will have a longer Progression Free Survival (PFS), as
      assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) when
      treated with pembrolizumab than when treated with SOC platinum-based chemotherapies.

      Treatment Phase: Participants randomized to pembrolizumab will be treated for up to 35
      cycles or until documented progressive disease (PD) occurs. Participants randomized to SOC
      chemotherapies will be treated with their randomized study drug for up to 4-6 cycles. After
      this, participants with non-squamous histologies may choose to be treated with maintenance
      pemetrexed for the remainder of the study or until disease progression, unacceptable adverse
      event(s) (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
      investigator's decision to withdraw the participant, noncompliance with study treatment or
      procedures requirements, the participant receives 35 treatments of study treatment
      (pembrolizumab arm only), or administrative reasons. Participants receiving pembrolizumab
      who stop drug administration after receiving 35 study treatments for reasons other than
      disease progression or intolerability, or participants who attain a complete response and
      stop study treatment may be eligible for retreatment with pembrolizumab upon experiencing
      disease progression. The decision to retreat with a second course of pembrolizumab will be
      at the discretion of the Investigator only if participants meet the criteria for retreatment
      and the study is ongoing. Retreatment (second course) is limited to 17 cycles. Participants
      randomized to receive SOC chemotherapy may be eligible to receive pembrolizumab if crossover
      criteria are met.

      Cross-Over Phase: This is only applicable for participants randomized to receive SOC.
      Eligible participants will be treated with pembrolizumab for the remainder of the study or
      until disease progression, unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that prevents further
      administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the participant,
      noncompliance with study treatment or procedures requirements, the participant receives 35
      treatments of study treatment (pembrolizumab arm only), or administrative reasons.
