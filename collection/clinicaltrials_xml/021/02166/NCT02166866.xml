        Caregivers will be recruited through the Mayo Clinic inpatient and outpatient services,

        Hematology, and Radiation Oncology and other clinics in the outpatient setting, and
        Divisions of HospitalMedicine, Hospice and Palliative Medicine, and other inpatient
        services in the hospital setting. This population was chosen as they are likely to
        experience caregiver-related distress for which the intervention will be beneficial.
