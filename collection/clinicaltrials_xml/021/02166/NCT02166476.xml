      Carbavance, (meropenem/vaborbactam) is being compared to piperacillin/tazobactam in the
      treatment of adults with cUTIs or AP

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the current era of increased resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenem
      antimicrobial agents are frequently the antibiotics of &quot;last defense&quot; for the most resistant
      pathogens in serious infections, including those found in cUTIs. The recent dissemination of
      serine carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae in many hospitals worldwide now poses a
      considerable threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of
      antimicrobial agents.

      Rempex is developing Carbavance (meropenem/vaborbactam) administered as a fixed combination
      by intravenous (IV) infusion, to treat serious Gram-negative infections, such as cUTIs,
      including those infections caused by bacteria resistant to currently available carbapenems.

    <description>For the FDA: the proportion of subjects in the microbiologic Modified Intent To Treat Population (m-MITT) who achieve overall success at the EOIVT visit. Overall success is achieved with a clinical outcome of Cure or Improvement and microbiologic outcome of Eradication at EOIVT. Cure is defined as the complete resolution or significant improvement of the baseline signs and symptoms. Improvement is defined as lessening, incomplete resolution, or no worsening of the baseline signs and symptoms. Eradication is defined as the demonstration that the bacterial pathogen(s) found at baseline is reduced to &lt;104 CFU/mL of urine.
For the European Medicines Agency (EMA): the proportion of subjects in the co-primary m-MITT and Microbiologic Evaluable (ME) Populations who achieve a microbiologic outcome of Eradication at the TOC visit. Eradication is defined as the demonstration that the bacterial pathogen(s) found at baseline is reduced to &lt;103 CFU/mL of urine.</description>
