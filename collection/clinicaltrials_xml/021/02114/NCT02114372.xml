  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the natural history of cognitive and functional
      changes in participants at risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) (MCI-AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center study that will enroll participants without dementia who
      are considered at high, medium and low risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a community-based register (referred to as the CHARIOT
      registry) in the United Kingdom. No interventions (ie, study drugs) will be administered to
      participants in the study. The planned duration of the study is approximately 4 years with
      up to 2 years for participant recruitment. Data collection to assess outcome measures
      associated with disease progression will occur at baseline and every 6 months thereafter at
      the clinic during the follow-up period of 48 months. Blood, urine, and saliva samples will
      be collected from participants during the study for biomarker analyses to assess risk
      factors for dementia, Alzheimer's disease or confounding factors of dementia risk. Adverse
      events experienced by the participants during their participation in the study will be
      monitored.

    <description>The high risk cohort includes participants whose age- and education-adjusted baseline cognitive performance is -0.6 to -1.0 standard deviation (SD) below normal on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Delayed Memory Index and -0.6 to -1.5 SD below normal on at least one other nonmemory RBANS cognitive domain one other cognitive domain.</description>

    <description>The medium risk amnestic cohort included participants whose age- and education adjusted baseline cognitive performance is 0.6-1.0 SD below normal on the RBANS Delayed Memory Index and all other RBANS nonmemory domains within normal limits operationally defined as greater than -0.6 SD.</description>

    <description>The medium risk nonamnestic cohort included participants whose age- and education adjusted baseline cognitive performance is greater than -0.6 SD below normal on the RBANS Delayed Memory Index and one or more other RBANS domains are between -0.6 to -1.0 SD below normal.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Low risk cohort</arm_group_label>
    <description>The low risk cohort included participants whose age- and education-adjusted baseline cognitive profile on the RBANS is within normal limits, as defined for this study as all RBANS domains greater than -0.6 SD below normal.</description>
