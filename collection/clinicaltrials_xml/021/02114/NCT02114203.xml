    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of an investigational drug, PF-04447943, in subjects with stable sickle
      cell disease with and without co-administration with hydroxyurea. This study will also aid
      in selecting the doses for future studies and evaluation of substances in the blood which
      may help access the effectiveness of the drug.
