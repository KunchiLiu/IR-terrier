  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on the efficacy and safety
      of amlodipine besylate in subjects with hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy.

      This study is being conducted to support a future marketing application for KIT-302, an oral
      fixed combination drug product (FCDP) consisting of the antihypertensive drug amlodipine
      besylate and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) celecoxib.

      KIT-302 is being developed as a &quot;convenience reformulation&quot; FCDP to facilitate and improve
      patient compliance with the once a day administration of its individual components,
      amlodipine and celecoxib, when used together for the treatment of hypertension in patients
      who also require the use of an NSAID for relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis.

      Although the final KIT-302 formulation will be a single capsule, for this study, two
      separate capsules will be utilized: one containing a commercial celecoxib capsule
      (Celebrex®) or matched placebo capsule and one containing a commercial amlodipine besylate
      tablet (Norvasc®) or matched placebo tablet.

      The study hypothesis is that treatment with the amlodipine besylate containing capsule plus
      the celecoxib containing capsule will reduce blood pressure (BP) in subjects with
      hypertension with an efficacy that is not substantially inferior to the effect of amlodipine
      besylate alone (i.e., the amlodipine containing capsule plus the matched placebo for the
      celecoxib capsule).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult 40 to 75 years of age

          2. Newly diagnosed hypertension that requires chronic pharmacological therapy.
             Specifically, the subject must meet both of the following criteria:

               1. Resting systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and ≤179 mmHg (where resting is defined as supine
                  for at least 10 minutes with minimal interaction) at Initial Screening Visit

               2. SBPday &gt;135 mmHg at Baseline Visit (Day 0)

          3. Body Mass Index of 18.5 to 34.9 kg/m2

          4. Healthy (other than hypertension) as determined by the Investigator based on medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and
             clinical laboratory tests

          5. A negative pregnancy test at Screening

          6. Both males and women of child bearing potential agree to use adequate contraceptive
             methods while on study (from Screening through final study visit)

          7. Able to comprehend and sign an informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Resting systolic BP &gt;179 mmHg or a resting diastolic BP &gt;110 mmHg at Screening (where
             resting is defined as supine for at least 10 minutes with minimal interaction) or
             SBP24h &gt;169 mmHg or DBP24h &gt;110 mmHg at randomization

          2. SBPday ≤135 mmHg at baseline (Day 0)

          4. Fragile health

          5. Evidence of clinically significant findings on screening evaluations (clinical,
             laboratory, and ECG) which, in the opinion of the Investigator would pose a safety
             risk or interfere with appropriate interpretation of safety data

          6. Current or recent history (within 4 weeks prior to Screening) of a clinically
             significant bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial infection

          7. Current clinically significant viral infection

             allergic type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs including
             cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors

         24. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are unable or unlikely to comply
             with the dosing schedule and study evaluations

         25. Pregnant or lactating

         26. Unable to correctly use ambulatory blood pressure monitor after instruction on its
             use

         27. Subjects with Child-Pugh Class B or C cirrhosis;

         28. Subjects currently taking a calcium channel blocker for any reason including angina.
             Subjects will not be withdrawn from these drugs to be enrolled in the trial

         29. Creatinine clearance &lt;50 ml/min as estimated by the Cockroft-Gault equation

         30. Known cytochrome P450 2C9 poor metabolizer
