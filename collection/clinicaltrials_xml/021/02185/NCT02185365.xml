  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When arthritis starts it can be noticed first in certain molecules in your joint.
      Proteoglycan is a molecule that is important to cartilage structure, and is lost as
      arthritis develops. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the best ways to image
      cartilage, and an investigational MRI technique that has shown great promise in detecting
      proteoglycan amounts is called T1-rho.

      In this study, patients with hip dysplasia will undergo this investigational MRI in addition
      to a well validated MRI method (called dGEMRIC) to see if T1-rho is as good as dGEMRIC at
      detecting cartilage damage. The dGEMRIC MRI requires an injection of a contrast agent, while
      the T1-rho MRI does not. If the T1-rho is shown to be as useful as the dGEMRIC method it can
      then be used to look at cartilage damage in the hip without having to have an injection.

    <measure>To assess proteoglycan amounts in hip cartilage in patients diagnosed with DDH and scheduled to undergo surgery to correct this problem.</measure>

    <description>Our aim is to correlate T1-rho with dGEMRIC values in painful hips with underlying DDH. To achieve this, we will assess whether T1-rho MRI values correlate with dGEMRIC MRI values in hips with DDH.</description>
