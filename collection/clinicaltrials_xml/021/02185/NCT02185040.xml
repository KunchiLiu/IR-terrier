      The study consists of 3 parts. Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CC-220 in Systemic Lupus
      Erythematosus (SLE) subjects.

      Subject participation in Part 1 consists of 3 phases:

        -  Pre-treatment Screening Phase: up to 28 days prior to the first dose of the
           investigational product (IP)

        -  Treatment Phase: up to 84 days

        -  Observation Phase: 84 day post-treatment A total of approximately 40 subjects will be
           randomized into 4 dose groups with a 4:1 ratio of CC-220 (0.3 mg every other day [QOD],
           0.3 mg everyday [QD], 0.6 mg and 0.3 mg on alternating days and 0.6 mg QD) or matching
           placebo (8 subjects in the CC-220 arm and 2 subjects in the placebo arm for each dose
           group). Subjects will be randomized into the first two dose groups of 0.3 mg QOD and
           0.3 mg QD in parallel.

      Following confirmation of safety of the first two dose groups, remaining subjects will then
      be randomized into the 0.6 mg and 0.3 mg on alternating days and 0.6 mg QD dose groups in a
      sequential, dose ascending manner (first the 0.6 mg and 0.3 mg on alternating days dose
      group followed by the 0.6 mg QD dose group) A subject will only be permitted to reduce their
      dose one time during the study. The Treatment Phase will be up to 84 days in duration for
      all dose groups.

      Subjects who discontinue IP early and all subjects who complete the 84 day treatment phase
      will enter into the Observational Follow-up Phase for an 84 day period. In all cases of
      early termination from the study, subjects will be encouraged to complete an Early
      Termination Visit.

      Part 2 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of CC-220 in SLE subjects with skin involvement. It will only be
      initiated once up to 8 subjects have completed 28 days of treatment in the 0.6 mg QD dose
      group for Part 1 and the 28 day safety assessment of the 0.6 mg QD dose group in Part 1 is
      completed.

      Subject participation in Part 2 will consist of 3 phases:

        -  Pre-treatment Screening Phase: up to 28 days prior to the start of the IP

        -  Treatment Phase: Up to 84 days

        -  Observation Phase: 84 day post-treatment Up to a total of approximately 100 subjects
           will be randomized into 4 dose groups of CC-220 (0.3 mg QOD, 0.3 mg QD, 0.6 mg and 0.3
           mg on alternating days and 0.6 mg QD) or matching placebo (20 subjects in each CC-220
           dosing arm and 20 subjects in the placebo arm). The dose groups included in Part 2 will
           be dependent on results from Part 1. Any dose group which does not demonstrate adequate
           safety, tolerability, PK or PD may not be used in Part 2. The Treatment Phase for Part
           2 will be up to 84 days in duration.

      Subjects who discontinue IP early and all subjects who complete the 84- day Treatment Phase
      will enter into the Observational Follow-up Phase for a 84-day period. In all cases of early
      termination from the study, subjects will be encouraged to complete an Early Termination
      Visit. Upon completion of, or discontinuation from the Treatment Phase for Part 1 or Part 2,
      all subjects (including premature discontinuations) will be have visits 28 days and 84 days
      after their final treatment visit during the 84 day Observational Follow-up Phase.

      The Active Treatment Extension Phase (ATEP) is an extension of the core CC-220-SLE-001 study
      to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety/tolerability of CC-220 in SLE subjects who
      completed Part 1 or Part 2 of the core study.

      Subjects who complete the Treatment Phase of Part 1 or Part 2 of the core study will be
      eligible to receive CC-220 in the ATEP for up to 2 years. All subjects who participate in
      the ATEP will receive the same active treatment they received during their participation in
      Part 1 or Part 2 with the exception of those on placebo or 0.3 mg every other day (QOD) (see
      below for information on dosing for these subjects).

      Subjects who complete the Treatment Phase of Part 1 or Part 2 of the core study will be
      eligible to enter this phase of the study and should be enrolled immediately to avoid dose
      interruption. In the event the ATEP has not been implemented by a subject's study center at
      the time they have completed the Treatment Phase, subjects will enter the Observation Phase
      of the core study and be eligible to enroll in the ATEP upon implementation of this
      amendment. There are no time restrictions on how long subjects can be off CC-220 prior to
      entering the ATEP as long as they completed treatment in Part 1 or Part 2 of the core study.
      Subjects who terminate the Treatment Phase of Part 1 or Part 2 early will not be eligible
      for entry into the ATEP.

      Subject participation consists of two phases:

        -  Active Treatment Extension Phase: Up to 2 years

        -  Observational Follow-up Phase: One month

             months after administration of the last dose of IP.

          -  Have a planned surgical procedure or a history of any other medical disease
             laboratory abnormality, or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes
             the subject unsuitable for the study. Disease Severity

          -  Unstable lupus nephritis defined as: eGFR of less than 50 mL/1.73 m2 . 17. CNS
             disease, including active severe CNS lupus (including seizures, psychosis, organic
             brain syndrome, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), cerebritis or CNS vasculitis)
             requiring therapeutic intervention within 6 months of screening.

          -  The subject has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart
             failure.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG). Subjects may have a positive
             antihepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) if the anti-hepatitis B surface antibody
             (anti-HBs) is positive as well (Appendix L). Note: for the ATEP, this exclusion will
             only apply to those subjects who come in for the ATEP greater than 14 days after
             their Part 1 or Part 2 Week 12 (Visit 10).

          -  Antibodies to hepatitis C at Screening. Note: for the ATEP, this exclusion will only
             apply for those subjects who come in for the ATEP greater than 14 days after their
             Part 1 or Part 2 Week 12 (Visit 10).

          -  The subject has a known positive history of antibodies to human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) or HIV disease or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDs).

          -  Has a history of an organ transplant (eg, heart, lung, kidney, liver) or
             hematopoietic stem cell/marrow transplant.

          -  Malignancy or history of malignancy, except for: • treated (ie, cured) basal cell or
             squamous cell in situ skin carcinomas; • treated (ie, cured) cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma in situ of the cervix with no evidence of recurrence
             within 5 years of Screening

          -  Systemic bacterial infections requiring treatment with oral or injectable
             antibiotics, or significant viral or fungal infections, within 4 weeks of Screening.
             Any treatment for such infections must have been completed and the infection cured,
             at least 2 weeks prior to Screening and no new or recurrent infections prior to the
             Baseline visit.

          -  History of venous thrombosis or any thromboembolic events within 2 years of
             screening.

          -  Clinical evidence of significant unstable or uncontrolled acute or chronic disease
             not due to SLE (ie, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, gastrointestinal,
             hepatic, renal, neurological, malignancy, psychiatric or infectious disease) which in
             the opinion of the investigator could put the subject at undue risk or confound study
             results.

          -  Presence of active uveitis or any other clinically significant ophthalmological
             finding. - History or current diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Hematology: • Neutrophil count ≤ 1.5 x 109 /L (subjects entering the ATEP within 14
             days can have a neutrophil count as low as 1.0 x 109 /L) • Hb ≤ 9 g/dL • Lymphocyte
             count ≤ 500/mm3 or 0.50 x 109 /L • Platelet count ≤ 100 x 109 /L • Serum
             immunoglobulin (Ig) levels: IgG ≤ the lower limit of normal (LLN) • Liver function
             tests: - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 2x
             upper limit of normal (ULN) - Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5 ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt; 35%). 30. Any clinically significant abnormalities on ECG, which, in the
             opinion of the investigator would interfere with safe participation in the study.
             General

          -  The subject is unlikely to comply with the study protocol or is unsuitable for any
             other reason, as judged by the investigator or medical monitor.

          -  Substance dependence or abuse within six months of the Screening Visit which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the patient's safety or ability to
             comply with the study procedures.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the investigational products/placebo, or components
             thereof or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. The subject has
             a history of severe allergic reactions to or hypersensitivity to any component of the
             IP or placebo. - History of tuberculosis (TB). Subjects with a history of TB who have
             completed a standard course of treatment (documented) are eligible for study entry.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (breast-feeding) females.
