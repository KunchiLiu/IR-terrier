      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and efficacy of a drug called
      saxagliptin (Onglyza) for treatment of type 2 diabetes in non-critically ill hospitalized
      patients who have an HbA1c of 7.5 or lower, on 1 or no non-insulin agent at home, or an
      HbA1c ≤7.0% on ≤ 2 non-insulin agents at home.

      The current professional organization guidelines recommend insulin as the preferred
      treatment for hospitalized patients. It is recommended that most critically ill patients
      should receive insulin infusion therapy and non-critically ill patients should receive basal
      bolus insulin therapy in the hospital.

      The study will test the hypothesis that treatment with saxagliptin is non-inferior to
      treatment with basal bolus insulin in this group of patients during their hospital stay. The
      study will evaluate the effect of saxagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, on glycemic control in
      non-critically ill hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)

      The primary outcome will be mean daily blood glucose levels during hospital days 2 to 5. The
      study is designed to detect a non-inferiority margin of 20% in the saxagliptin group as
      compared to the control group
