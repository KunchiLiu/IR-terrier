  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headaches are a common medical problem that physicians frequently encounter in their
      practice. One of key findings of The Atlas of Headache Disorders prepared by World Health
      Organization (WHO) is: headache disorders, including migraine and tension-type headache
      (TTH), are among the most prevalent disorders of mankind. The fixed combination of
      indomethacin, prochlorperazine and caffeine (IndoProCaf) showed efficacy and safety in acute
      treatment of migraine and episodic tension-type headache attacks. IndoProCaf (Difmetre®) is
      widely used in common daily practice only in Italy from early 1970s, is available at the
      Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) pharmaceutical market now. There are limited data
      regarding IndoProCaf usage from post-marketing settings. This will be a first post-marketing
      observational study which aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and patients' satisfaction of
      primary headaches acute treatment in routine clinical settings in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

      The study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, observational, non-interventional,
      non-randomized, non-controlled, single arm, post-marketing study where IndoProCaf will be
      prescribed in the usual manner per standard clinical practice of the treating physician and
      in accordance with the terms of the locally approved instruction for medical use. No
      additional procedures (other than the standard of care) shall be applied to the patients.
