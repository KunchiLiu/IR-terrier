      The purpose of this study is to determine if oral iron (FE) polysaccharide is superior to
      oral placebo in improving functional capacity as measured by change in peak VO2 by CPET
      (Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing) , of a broad population of patients with HFrEF (Heart
      Failure Exercise Testing) and Fe deficiency at 16 weeks.

      Hypothesis: In a broad population of HFrEF patients with Fe deficiency, compared to oral
      placebo, therapy with oral Fe polysaccharide will be associated with improvement in
      functional capacity at 16 weeks as assessed by CPET.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic options to further improve functional capacity and symptoms in HF beyond
      neurohormonal antagonism are limited. Studies have demonstrated impaired oxidative capacity
      of skeletal muscle among HF patients, which may contribute to symptoms of breathlessness and
      persistent fatigue.

      In addition to its role in erythropoiesis, iron (Fe) plays a critical role in skeletal
      muscle's oxygen (O2)-storage capacity (myoglobin) and systemic aerobic energy production. As
      Fe deficiency is common in patients with symptomatic HF, repletion of iron stores may
      improve submaximal exercise capacity among these patients beyond the effects on
      erythropoiesis.

      While intravenous Fe repletion in HF patients with mild Fe-deficiency (i.e. Ferritin &lt;100 or
      Ferritin 100-299 with transferrin saturation &lt;20%) with or without anemia global well-being
      and functional status, oral Fe repletion has not been studied. Furthermore, the efficacy of
      oral Fe to replete iron stores in a similar population and its impact on functional
      capacity, measured objectively by peak VO2, remains unknown.
