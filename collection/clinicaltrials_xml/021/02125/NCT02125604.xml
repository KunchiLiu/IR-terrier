    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of symptomatic therapies on
      gastrointestinal-related events reported by participants with relapsing-remitting multiple
      sclerosis initiating therapy with BG00012 (dimethyl fumarate, DMF) in the clinical practice
      setting.

      The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are as follows: To evaluate
      gastrointestinal-related events requiring symptomatic therapy and the role of those
      therapies over time; To evaluate gastrointestinal-related events that lead to a physician's
      decision to manage the events with BG00012 dose modification; and To evaluate
      gastrointestinal-related events that lead to BG00012 discontinuation after the use of
      symptomatic therapy.
