  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited published clinical data about the natural history of renal disease in
      Alport syndrome. The RG012-01 study will collect data to characterize the progression of
      renal dysfunction in Alport syndrome patients.

      Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Alport syndrome who have qualifying GFR will be
      considered for enrollment. The sequential sampling of subjects' urine and/or blood will
      allow an assessment of the rate of change of established clinical endpoints, such as GFR
      and/or the rate of change of other renal biomarkers (proteinuria and Î²-2 microglobulin) in
      subjects whose renal function is steadily declining. The identification of surrogate markers
      that track the decline of renal function and could correlate with time to end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) is a key goal of the natural history study.

      This is a natural history study, designed to collect data from patients with Alport syndrome
      with qualifying GFR. Assessments and blood and urine sample collection will be performed at
      Baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter, for up to 120 weeks. Scheduling of clinic visits
      will take in to consideration the timing of Standard of Care (SOC) visits. Alternative
      arrangements may be made to enable subjects to schedule a home nurse visit for study
      procedures instead of certain clinic visits. Remaining blood and urine aliquots will be
      stored and may be used in the future for the discovery, analysis, verification and/or
      validation of other biomarkers or test for renal disease. The samples will be kept for up to
      five years. Each sample will be identified only by it's barcode number and will not be
      individually identifiable.
