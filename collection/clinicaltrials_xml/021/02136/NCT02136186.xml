      This study will evaluate the efficacy of home telemonitoring as an intervention to decrease
      hospital readmissions in patients at high risk for readmission. The overall readmission rate
      for high-risk MCF hospital patients is approximately 20%. Currently a system is in place to
      identify and score all MCF patients for their risk of readmission. This score is based on
      multiple variables including but not limited to: co-morbid conditions, patient's health
      literacy, whether they are a Medicare/Medicaid patient, their in-home social support, and
      whether they have had prior hospital admissions within the previous year. The literature
      shows that home telemonitoring of patients has had mixed results for effectiveness at
      preventing hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Many of these reports have
      restricted studies to patients with specific diseases or general characteristics; some have
      shown improved results while others have not. No study has examined patients who are high
      risk for readmission to determine if home telemonitoring for 30 days post-discharge reduces
      the risk for 30-day readmission.
