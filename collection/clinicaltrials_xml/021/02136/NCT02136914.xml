  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, parallel group
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADS-5102 extended release (ER) capsules, an
      investigational formulation of amantadine, dosed once nightly at bedtime for the treatment
      of levodopa induced dyskinesia (LID) in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). The novel
      pharmacokinetic profile of ADS-5102 is expected to achieve i) maximal concentrations in the
      early morning through mid-day, when LID can be troublesome, and ii) lower concentrations in
      the evening, potentially reducing the negative impact of amantadine on sleep. This
      pharmacokinetic profile could enable higher doses to be tolerated with a once-nightly ER
      formulation than can be tolerated with an immediate-release formulation. The once-nightly
      dosing regimen may also provide enhanced convenience and compliance.

      In a previous clinical study, ADS-5102 met its primary endpoint; LID was significantly
      reduced as measured by the change in UDysRS score over 8 weeks vs. placebo.
