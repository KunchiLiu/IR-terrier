    <measure>change in weekly average daily pain score (ADPS), DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 0) to week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to compare change in weekly average daily pain score (ADPS) from baseline to Week 13 in subjects receiving either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline (week 0) to Week 13.</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the proportion of subjects receiving either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo who meet fixed definitions of response (i.e. ≥ 30% or ≥ 50% reduction from baseline to Week 13 in ADPS)</description>

    <measure>change in patient global impression measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 0) to Week 13.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effects of either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo on patient global impression of change (PGIC).
This standard instrument is a well-validated outcome measure for pain treatment and shows close correlation with the 11-point pain intensity NRS in the setting of chronic pain. The 7-point PGIC measures change in the subject's overall status using the following categorical scale: 1) very much improved, 2) much improved, 3) minimally improved, 4) no change, 5) minimally worse, 6) much worse, and 7) very much worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in FIQ measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effects of either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo on the fibromyalgia (FM) Impact Questionnaire (FIQ).
The FIQ is composed of 10 items. The first item contains 11 questions related to physical functioning - each question is rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale. Items 2 and ask the patient to mark the number of days that they feel well and the number of days they were unable to work (including housework) because of FM symptoms. Items 4 through 10 are horizontal linear scales marked in 10 increments on which the patient rates work difficulty, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety, and depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in MFI-20 measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 0) to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effects of either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo on fatigue as assessed by the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20).
The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a validated 20-item, self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the following dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation, and reduced activity. The respondent is asked to mark an X in 1 of 5 boxes arranged linearly and anchored by &quot;yes, that is true&quot; at one pole to &quot;no, that is not true&quot; at the opposite pole. The MFI-20 is a brief measure of fatigue that appears to capture relevant dimensions of fatigue severity and offers great clarification of the type of fatigue being experienced and good assessment and precision. It has been used successfully in clinical trials of FM and appears to be a good marker of illness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in HADS measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 0) to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effects of either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo on depression and anxiety as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
The HADS questionnaire is a reliable, widely-used self -assessment scale to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression. The instrument consists of 7 questions related to anxiety and 7 related to depression, each rated on a 4-point scale (score of 0 to 3). Scores for anxiety and depression are independently summed to compute HADS-Anxiety and HADS-Depression subscale scores, with ranges from 0 to 21, where higher scores indicate greater severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in SF-36 measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 0) to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effects of either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo on subject general health status as assessed by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire.
The SF-36 is a generic health survey that asks 36 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. It is a practical, reliable, and valid measure of physical and mental health widely used across various disease areas, including FM. The SF-36 provides scores for 8 health domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health) as well as psychometrically-based physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in EQ-5D measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 0) to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effects of either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo on subject quality of life as assessed by the EuroQoL Instrument 5 Domains (EQ-5D).
The EQ-5D is a well-standardized instrument that shows high construct validity and responsiveness in patients with chronic pain and has been used specifically in FM. The EQ-5D includes a descriptive section with 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that are combined into an overall health utilities index, and an NRS (100 mm VAS) that measures perception of overall health, with zero indicating worst health and 100 representing best imaginable health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in pain-associated sleep interference, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 0) to week 13</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effects of either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo on pain-associated sleep interference as assessed by average daily sleep interference score (ADSIS) and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale.
Pain-associated sleep interference will be assessed using electronic daily diaries using an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (pain does not interfere with sleep) to 10 (pain completely interferes with sleep, unable to sleep). The diary is to be filled out every day, along with the pain diary question, from the start of the Baseline Period through the last day on blinded study drug (including the morning following the last dose of blinded study medication).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in BPI-SF measure, DS-5565 versus placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 0) to week 13</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effects of either dose of DS-5565 versus placebo on pain as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF).
The BPI-SF has been used in many clinical studies across a wide variety of chronic pain conditions, including FM. This instrument measures pain severity and interference within the past 24 hours. Each item is rated on an 11-point NRS from 0 to 10.</description>
