  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a Phase Ib, open-label, non-randomized, single-institution
      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of carfilzomib in combination with
      bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and to determine the
      recommended phase II dose and preliminary efficacy of this combination. The study will have
      two phases: a dose-escalation phase to determine the maximal tolerated dose of carfilzomib
      in this combination where participants will be monitored for toxicity, tolerability and
      response and a dose-expansion phase that will determine the preliminary efficacy in patients
      with Mantle cell lymphoma or any other disease subtype in which there is a preliminary
      efficacy signal observed.

      Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will follow standard 3+3 design with
      escalation of the carfilzomib dose only (Table 5.2). Dose levels of carfilzomib will be 15
      mg/m2, 20 mg/m2, 27 mg/m2, and 36 mg/m2 IV administered on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16. The
      last 2 cohorts will have a starting carfilzomib dose of 20 mg/m2 on days 1, 2. Bendamustine
      will be administered at the well-tolerated dose of 90 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 2. A dose
      de-escalation of bendamustine to 75 mg/m2 (cohort -1) will occur if the starting dose proves
      intolerable in this combination. Rituximab will be given at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on day 9 of
      Cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Rituximab will be intentionally delayed to day 9 of
      cycle 1 to help facilitate performance of the correlative studies.
