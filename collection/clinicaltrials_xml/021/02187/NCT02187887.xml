      The primary objective of the research study is to test the feasibility of a brief
      Internet-based intervention to reduce heavy alcohol use among young adult veterans of wars
      in Iraq and Afghanistan. Veterans are recruited through the social media website Facebook in
      two phases. In the first phase, investigators collect data from 800 veteran participants to
      document and analyze drinking norms in this population. In the second phase, investigators
      use the norms collected in Phase 1 and information from the analyses to develop and pilot
      test an online intervention with young adult veteran participants. Six hundred participants
      are recruited through Facebook and randomly assigned to intervention (N = 300) or control (N
      = 300) conditions. It is hypothesized that those in the intervention condition will drink
      less at a one-month follow-up period than those in the control condition. Investigators also
      collect feedback from participants on the usability of the online intervention.
