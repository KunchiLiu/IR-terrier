      Primary Objective:

      To estimate the incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events during
      treatment with blinatumomab in pediatric and adolescent subjects with B-precursor ALL in
      second or later bone marrow relapse, in any marrow relapse after alloHSCT, or refractory to
      other treatments

      Secondary Objective(s):

      To describe key efficacy outcomes, including incidence of complete response (CR) within 2
      cycles of blinatumomab, minimal residual disease (MRD) remission within 2 cycles of
      blinatumomab, relapse free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), incidence of alloHSCT, and
      100-day mortality after alloHSCT.

      Hypotheses:

      A formal statistical hypothesis will not be tested. The incidence of treatment-emergent and
      treatment-related adverse events will be estimated.

      Study Endpoints:

        -  Incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events

        -  Incidence of CR within 2 cycles of blinatumomab

        -  MRD remission within 2 cycles of blinatumomab

        -  RFS

        -  OS

        -  Incidence of alloHSCT

        -  100-day mortality after alloHSCT

      Study Design:

      Multi-center, open-label, single-arm expanded access protocol

    <description>A single cycle of blinatumomab treatment is 6 weeks in duration, which includes 4 weeks of blinatumomab CIVI followed by a 2 week treatment-free interval. In the first cycle, if the patient shows an M3 bone marrow, the initial dose of blinatumomab will be 5μg/m2/day for the first 7 days which will be escalated to 15μg/m2/day on D8 through D29. For all subsequent cycles 15μg/m2/day will be the dose for all 4 weeks of continuous treatment. In case of M2 bone marrow at screening, the initial dose will start at 15μg/m2/day for the first 7 days of treatment and no dose step will be performed at D8. For all subsequent cycles the dose will stay 15μg/m2/day. A dose of 9μg/day for the initial dose (if applicable for an M3 bone marrow at screening) and 28μg/day for the escalated dose after dose step should not be exceeded regardless of body surface area, cytomorphology, or immunophenotype. The dose for the next cycle has to be recalculated in case a weight change of ≥ 10% occurs within a cycle.</description>

        This study seeks pediatric subjects aged &gt; 28 days and &lt; 18 years with relapsed/refractory
        B-precursor ALL, to include:

          -  Second or later bone marrow relapse,

          -  Any marrow relapse after alloHSCT, or

          -  Refractory to prior treatments:

               -  For patients in first relapse: failure to achieve a CR following full standard
                  reinduction chemotherapy regimen

               -  For patients who have not achieved a first remission: failure to achieve
                  remission following a full standard induction regimen

          -  Subjects previously treated with blinatumomab may be eligible, if blinatumomab was
             tolerated and response was achieved Note: Selection of sites for this expanded access
             protocol is limited to sites that have gained experience in the use of blinatumomab
             in the previous Ph1/2 Pediatric and Adolescent trial MT103-205. If other institutions
             have patients they would like to put on the expanded access protocol, these patients
             need to be referred to the open participating sites.
