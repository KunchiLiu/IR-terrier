    <textblock>
      This open-label, international, multicenter study will investigate the safety and efficacy
      of GDC-0199 in combination with bendamustine plus rituximab (GDC-0199 + BR) compared with BR
      alone in participants with relapsed and refractory fNHL, comparing two
      chemotherapy-containing regimens (Chemotherapy-Containing Cohort). In addition, an
      exploratory analysis of the safety and efficacy of GDC-0199 in combination with rituximab
      (GDC-0199 + Rituximab), a chemotherapy-free regimen, will be performed (Chemotherapy-Free
      Cohort). Assignment to the Chemotherapy-Containing or Chemotherapy-Free Cohort will be
      decided at the discretion of the investigator, unless one of the cohorts is not open to
      enrollment; in which case, participants may be enrolled only to the open cohort. The first 6
      participants enrolled in the Chemotherapy-Containing Cohort (or more if required) will
      comprise the Safety Run-In group for Treatment Arm B, dosing GDC-0199 at 600 milligrams (mg)
      in combination with BR. Once a dose has been chosen from the Safety Run-In Period,
      randomization to the two treatment arms of the Chemotherapy-Containing Cohort (Arms B and C)
      will begin. The anticipated time on study treatment is approximately 24-52 weeks, depending
      on treatment arm.
