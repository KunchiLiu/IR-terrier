      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety (at 1 month) and the performance (at
      3-6 months) post last embolization with Onyx or Onyx associated with other embolization
      products (cyanoacrylate glue, coils, balloon, other…)

        All patients presenting at the participating centers for whom an intracranial dAVF (not
        previosly treated) needs to be treated (unrelated to the planned treatment) and who agree
        to the collection and transmission of related data.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has an intracranial dAVF which could be treated by ONYX embolization,
             whether or not associated to other embolization products.

          -  The patient is at least 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient needs to be treated for the dAVF with another treatment option (for
             example by surgery) than embolization within a period of less than 6 months (to be
             counted as from the first treatment)

          -  The patient participates to another clinical study during the treatment period for
             his/her dAVF, evaluating another medical devices, procedure or medication.

          -  The patient refuses to give consent to the collection and processing of data required
             for centralized monitoring.

          -  A condition which could jeopardize follow-up of the patient.
