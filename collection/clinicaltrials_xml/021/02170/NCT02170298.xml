  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) on the neural
      and behavioral subcomponents of self-control, that is cognitive control and reward
      functioning, in adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

      The investigators hypothesize that LDX is associated with 1a) decreased task-independent
      locus coeruleus (LC) activity; 1b) increased task-related activity in LC and the cognitive
      control network; 2) increased LC connectivity with the cognitive control network and 3)
      improved task performance and self-control. The investigators will test their hypotheses on
      fMRI data with linear contrasts of voxel-wise maps of parameter estimates (in both
      univariate and connectivity analyses).

      The investigators will also assess change in brain activity with the LDX in the LC and
      ventral tegmental areas (VTA) as we hypothesize that they are altered in ADHD and related to
      cognitive control and self-control dysfunction in ADHD.

      The investigators will use a repeated-measures, between-subject design to compare the
      effects of oral once daily LDX in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial (RCT)
      on neural (fMRI) and behavioral correlates of cognitive control via a working memory and a
      reward - delay discounting task in adolescents and young adults.

               4. The subject experiences Adverse Events during the trial that would, in the
                  investigator's judgment, preclude further exposure to LDX

               5. The subject had protocol violations during the trial considered major in the
                  judgment of the investigator (significant noncompliance, use of prohibited
                  concomitant medications, concern with use of drugs of abuse, etc.), which would
                  deem them poor candidates for this trial

               6. Sexually active males who will not commit to utilizing an approved birth control
                  methods or who will not remain abstinent during the trial and for 90 days
                  following the last dose of study drug. Sexually active females of childbearing
                  potential who will not commit to utilizing 1 of the approved birth control
                  methods or who will not remain abstinent during the trial and for 30 days
                  following the last dose of study drug. Abstinence will be permitted if it is
                  confirmed and documented at every trial visit. If employing birth control, 1 of
                  the following precautions must be used: vasectomy, tubal ligation, vaginal

                  interest to continue

               9. Contraindication for MRI scanning (e.g., metal implants, pacemakers, metal
                  foreign bodies, pregnancy)

          -  Beast-feeding (if applicable)

                  (e.g. Acetazolamide, some Thiazides).

               3. Dextroamphetamine is known to inhibit monoamine oxidase, as well as a metabolite
                  of furazolidone. Concurrent administration of monoamine oxidase (MAOI)
                  inhibitors is contraindicated because MAOIs potentially can result in
                  hypertensive crisis. Vyvanse should not be given for at least 14 days after
                  discontinuation of an MAO inhibitor.

               1. A positive drug screen for cocaine or other drugs of abuse (excluding caffeine,
                  nicotine or prescribed psychostimulants for ADD/ADHD)

               2. History of substance dependence or abuse disorder currently or within past 5
                  years.
