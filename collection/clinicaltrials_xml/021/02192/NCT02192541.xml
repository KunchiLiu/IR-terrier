      Background:

      - Some people have cancers that don t respond to standard treatments. In these cases,
      doctors may try to use drugs to slow the growth of the cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and efficacy of the drug combination of ganetespib and ziv-aflibercept.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18 and over with advanced cancer of the colon, lung, urinary tract, and
      sarcomas.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, blood tests, and scans to measure
           their tumors.

        -  Participants will have one or two eye exams, with dilating eye drops.

        -  Participants will get the study drugs at the clinic as an infusion in a vein.
           Ganetespib will be given once a week on the same day for 3 weeks in a row, followed by
           a 1-week rest period. Ziv-aflibercept will be given once every other week. The drugs
           will be given in 28-day cycles.

        -  Participants may have a small piece of their tumor collected once or twice. This is
           done using a small needle during computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
           (MRI), or ultrasound scan.

        -  Participants will have their blood pressure checked at each visit. They will check it
           at home every day of the study.

        -  Participants may have one or more whole-body PET scans with 89Zr-panitumumab. A small
           amount of a radioactive chemical will be injected through a tube in an arm.
           Participants will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the donut-shaped PET scanner.
           They will have small amounts of blood drawn.

        -  Participants may stay in the study as long as they are tolerating the drugs and their
           tumor is not getting worse.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Ganetespib is a non-geldamycin synthetic inhibitor of Hsp90 that has demonstrated
           activity against multiple cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts in preclinical models.
           Inhibiting the Hsp90 chaperone complex results in the recruitment of ubiquitin ligases,
           polyubiquination, and proteosomal degradation of Hsp90 client proteins, including
           transcription factors and proteins involved in angiogenesis (VEGF, VEGFR, HIF-1,
           STAT-3); growth factor independence (RAF, EGFR,Her2, IGFR); resistance to anti-growth
           signals (CDK4); tissue invasion and metastases (MET, MMP2); and avoidance of apoptosis
           (AKT, RIP, Survivin, Bcl-2).

        -  HIF-1 activation has been implicated in mediating resistance to anti-angiogenic
           therapy; recent evidence implicates a greater role for Hsp90 in direct modulation of
           VEGF signaling.

        -  Combining Hsp90 inhibition with ganetespib and anti-angiogenic therapy with
           Ziv-Aflibercept, a soluble fusion protein with high binding affinity for VEGF-A,
           VEGF-B, and PIGF, presents a rational novel strategy for improving upon and overcoming
           resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      - To establish the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination
      of ganetespib and Ziv-Aflibercept in patients with refractory gastrointestinal carcinomas,
      non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, and sarcomas

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To assess modulation of HIF1 as a pharmacodynamic marker of therapy with the
           combination of ganetespib and Ziv-Aflibercept

        -  To assess modulation of EGFR expression using 89Zr-labeled, EGFR-targeting antibody
           panitumumab PET/CT imaging of tumor lesions prior to and following treatment with study
           drugs

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic gastrointestinal carcinomas,
           non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, and sarcomas with
           disease progression after at least one line of standard therapy

        -  Participants in the expansion phase must demonstrate EGFR expression on archival tumor
           samples and have disease amenable to biopsy with willingness to undergo pre- and
           post-treatment biopsies

        -  No major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment, no radiation or chemotherapy
           within 3 weeks prior to enrollment; patients must have recovered from toxicities of
           prior therapies to at least eligibility levels prior to enrollment.

      STUDY DESIGN:

        -  Ganetespib will be administered intravenously weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day
           cycle. Ziv-Aflibercept will be administered intravenously every 2 weeks, on days 1 and
           15, during a 28-day cycle.

        -  The escalation portion of the trial will follow a standard 3+3 design, whereby patients
           are dose-escalated in cohorts of 3 until dose-limiting toxicity is observed.

        -  Once the MTD is established, 10 additional patients will be enrolled to the expansion
           phase, at the MTD, and tumor biopsies will be obtained to assess pharmacodynamic
           endpoints. During cycle 1 of the expansion phase, ganetespib will be administered
           intravenously weekly, on days 8 and 15 with omission of day 1 treatment to accommodate
           a baseline biopsy pre-ganetespib but after administration of Ziv-Aflibercept. For all
           subsequent cycles, ganetespib will be administered days 1, 8, and 15. Ziv-Aflibercept
           will still be administered intravenously every 2 weeks, on days 1 and 15, of a 28-day
           cycle.

        -  PET/CT imaging with 89Zr-labeled panitumumab will be performed to evaluate tumor
           distribution prior to and following treatment with study agents.

        90 mmHg (diastolic blood pressure) for eligibility. Initiation or adjustment of
        antihypertensive medications is permitted prior to study entry provided that the average
        of three blood pressure measurements at enrollment visit is less than 140/90 mmHg.

        The effects of ganetespib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
        because anti-angiogenic agents similar to ziv-aflibercept are known to be teratogenic,
        women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use two forms of contraception
        (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence; sterilization) prior to study
        entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completing study
        treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
        partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
        immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use two forms of
        contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 3
        months after completion of administration of both ganetespib and ziv-aflibercept.

        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        During the escalation phase of the protocol, patients may have evaluable or measurable
        disease. During the expansion phase of the protocol, patients must have 1) measurable
        disease, 2) disease amenable to biopsy and 3) willingness to undergo pre- and
        post-treatment biopsies.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for
        nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered
        from adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier.

        Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

        Patients with known active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from
        this clinical trial. Patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable
        for greater than or equal to 4 weeks following treatment of brain metastases are eligible
        to participate at the discretion of the principal investigator.

        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        untreated infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
        with study requirements.

        Patients with known serious cardiac illness or medical conditions, including but not

        limited to:

          -  Clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation,
             symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, unstable angina or
             history of myocardial infarct within 6 months prior to enrollment, or indwelling
             temporary pacemaker

          -  Ventricular tachycardia or a supraventricular tachycardia that requires treatment
             with antiarrhythmic agents

          -  Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block unless treated with a permanent
             pacemaker

          -  Complete left bundle branch block

          -  History of long QT syndrome or a family member with this condition

        No major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or history of gastrointestinal
        bleeding within 3 months prior to enrollment. No signs or symptoms of active bleeding or
        nonhealing ulcer will be permitted at study entry. Patients with central pulmonary tumors
        with evidence of bronchial invasion, or presenting with hemoptysis will be excluded.

        QTc &gt; 470 msec on electrocardiogram (by Bazett s; average of triplicate recordings at the
        discretion of the PI) will exclude patients from entry on study. Medications that are
        known to cause QTc interval prolongation are prohibited for patients entering on trial.
        Patients for whom a given medication that may cause QTc interval prolongation cannot be
        discontinued, may be eligible at the discretion of the study PI, provided QTc interval
        criteria is met at enrollment. A comprehensive list of agents with the potential to cause
        QTc prolongation can be found in Appendix C and at http://crediblemeds.org.

        Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study because the
        effects of the study drugs on the developing fetus are unknown.

        HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the
        potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ganetespib and zivaflibercept. In
        addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
        marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving
        combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

        Substrates of CYP3A4 or CYP2C19

        Preliminary results of a clinical drug-drug interaction study, examining the effect of
        ganetespib on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2C19-sensitive probe omeprazole,show a modest
        (20%) increase in omeprazole exposure when coadministered with ganetespib. In vitro data
        implies expectation of greater interaction with CYP2C19substrates than with CYP3A4
        substrates. Caution is advised when sensitive narrow therapeutic range CYP3A4 or CYP2C19
        substrates are concomitantly administered.

        Inhibitors of P-Glycoprotein Efflux Transporters

        Concomitant medications that are strong inhibitors of P-glycoprotein efflux transporters
        should be used with caution during the study; examples of these medications include
        ritonavir, cyclosporine, verapamil, erythromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, quinidine,
        and elacridar.

        Concurrent anticoagulation will be permitted providing the patient is receiving a stable
        dose of anticoagulants before study entry. Patients receiving anticoagulants will be
        eligible for this trial. Evidence of clinically significant bleeding diathesis or
        underlying coagulopathy (e.g., INR &gt; 1.5 without vitamin K antagonist therapy) will not be
        permitted.
