      This study focuses on implementing and evaluating an evidence-based collaborative method of
      increasing immunization rates among preschool children, adolescents and adults within an
      Accountable Care Organization-Public Health collaborative. The infrastructure we will create
      through this project will serve as the framework for future collaborative delivery of other
      preventive services.

      The current project leverages newly formed Regional Care Collaborative Organizations (RCCO)
      in Colorado that are charged with providing comprehensive care for children and adults
      insured by Medicaid. With a new RCCO-public health collaborative we will implement a
      randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of 1) evidence-based collaborative
      centralized method of increasing immunization delivery using reminder/recall techniques
      versus 2) traditional practice-based reminder/recall techniques that are done by individual
      practices (not centrally). These interventions have been previously developed by the study
      team in different clinical settings. The project will examine the collaborative centralized
      approach, implemented within the new RCCO-public health collaborative first among preschool
      children, the group in which it has been previously studied. We will then extend the method
      to new populations, including adolescents and adults within the RCCO, and will evaluate the
      effectiveness of the intervention in each population.
