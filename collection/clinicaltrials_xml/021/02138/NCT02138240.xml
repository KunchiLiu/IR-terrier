  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 1.2 million households living in public housing are disproportionately affected by
      obesity, where prevalence is estimated at 50%. An ecologic framework hypothesizes that this
      disparity is related, in part, to social and environmental factors within these
      neighborhoods that influence residents' lifestyles. Social networks and the built
      environment may work together to promote or inhibit lifestyle behaviors; however, combined
      social network-built environment interventions have not previously targeted changes in diet.
      We hypothesize that an intervention that combines a social network approach with strategies
      that address public housing residents' challenges related to the built environment will
      improve dietary habits. Our overall aim is to develop a combined social network-built
      environment intervention to reduce intake of beverages high in added sugars and to pilot
      test the intervention among residents of public housing developments in Baltimore, MD. Our
      aim for this work is: 1) To develop a combined social network-built environment intervention
      to reduce intake of beverages high in added sugars and to pilot test the intervention among
      residents of public housing developments in Baltimore, MD. We hypothesize that a social
      network intervention will be feasible and acceptable in promoting healthy lifestyle change,
      and that this intervention will alter lifestyle behaviors among public housing residents.

      We will conduct a 6-month non-randomized trial of the social network intervention described
      below. This will be a single arm trial in which we compare the outcomes of interest pre- and
      post- intervention. We will adapt an HIV risk reduction social network intervention to
      create a new social network intervention targeting reduction in intake of sugar-sweetened
      beverages (SSB). Our primary outcomes will be to test the acceptability and feasibility of
      the intervention and its components as well as estimate the likely effect of the
      intervention.

      In the intervention, individuals will be recruited and trained to be &quot;Peer Educators&quot; who
      will participate in group sessions and then communicate this information with members of
      their social network (&quot;Sidekick&quot;) and work to make changes to reduce intake of added sugars
      together. Given the frequent intake of SSB in this population, the intervention will focus
      on reducing added sugar intake through the reduced consumption of SSB. Peer Educators will
      participate in 6 core group sessions over a 6-week period as well as 3 additional booster
      sessions after completing the core curriculum. All sessions will be delivered by a
      facilitator and assistant facilitator using a guide. All groups will be held in a room in
      each public housing development's administrative building.
