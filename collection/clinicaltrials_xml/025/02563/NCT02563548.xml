      This is a phase 1b study evaluating a combination of PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab for subjects
      with relapsed/refractory advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who have
      failed at least 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and subjects with relapsed/refractory
      locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma after failing at least 1 chemotherapy
      regimen.

      This is a phase 1b study for subjects with relapsed/refractory advanced or metastatic NSCLC
      who have failed at least 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and subjects with
      relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma after failing at
      least 1 chemotherapy regimen. This study will consist of a Phase 1b dose escalation portion
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of either 1.6, 2.2, 2.6, 3.0, 4.0 ug/kg (or
      higher doses if necessary) of PEGPH20 in combination with Pembrolizumab. Once the
      recommended phase 2 dose has been identified in the escalation portion, additional patients
      selected for high-HA tumors will be enrolled in the dose expansion portion

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed and documented, previously treated stage IIIB or IV Non
             Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) having failed at least 1 previous platinum containing
             chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic disease or
             relapsed/refractory locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma having
             failed at least 1 previous chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic
             disease. Subjects with NSCLC who are known to be epidermal growth factor receptor
             (EGFR)-mutation positive must have received an EGFR inhibitor and subjects known to
             be anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-mutation positive must have received an ALK
             inhibitor.

             consecutive core biopsy slides from 1 archival block that meet specific tissue
             requirements are available.

               -  One or more tumors measurable on CT scan/MRI scan per RECIST v 1.1. - Previously

               -  Life expectancy â‰¥3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             antibody (anti- PD-1) or PD-1 ligand-antibody (anti-PD-L1) agents.

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV (Appendix D) cardiac disease or myocardial
             infarction within the past 12 months before screening, or preexisting atrial
             fibrillation.

          -  Prior history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack.

          -  NSCLC subjects with known brain metastases (certain exceptions allowed)

          -  Gastric adenocarcinoma subjects with brain metastases

          -  History of active bleeding within the last 3 months requiring transfusion

          -  Anti-VEGF therapy within the last month

          -  Patients with known interstitial fibrosis or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Previous history of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary embolism found on screening exam.

          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or
             documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or syndrome that requires
             systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.

          -  History of another primary cancer within the last 3 years that required treatment,
             with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, early-stage prostate cancer, or
