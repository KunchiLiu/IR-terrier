  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of tremelimumab with brain radiation
      therapy can help treat this type of breast cancer that has spread to the brain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Simon 2-stage single-arm design (n=17) will be employed to evaluate for preliminary
      efficacy. A maximum of 17 subjects will be accrued to the efficacy arm. After the first 3
      patients are enrolled in the efficacy arm, a 6 week enrollment hold will be conducted in
      order to ensure safety before additional patients are enrolled. An interim assessment will
      then occur after the first 9 subjects have enrolled, and the accrual to this arm will
      proceed only if a pre-specified futility threshold is met. Patients not requiring
      continuation of HER2 directed therapy, such as trastuzumab, will be enrolled in this arm.

          -  Recovered from all toxicities associated with prior treatment, to acceptable baseline
             status or grade 1 or less (for lab toxicities see below limits for inclusion,),

             months after the final dose of investigational product; cessation of contraception
             after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic
             abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods

          -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing
             potential must use a highly effective method of contraception from Days 1 through 90
             post last dose. In addition, they must refrain from sperm donation for 90 days after
