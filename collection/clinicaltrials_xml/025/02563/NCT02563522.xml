      A phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 7-month study
      designed to assess the safety and efficacy of intramuscular (IM) injections in the calf of
      VM202 in patients with chronic nonhealing foot ulcers. Three hundred patients will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio of VM202 or placebo injections:

        -  Active -VM202 + standard of care - 200 patients

        -  Control - Placebo (VM202 Vehicle) + standard of care - 100 patients

          -  Documented history of Type I or II diabetes with current treatment control (HbA1c of

          -  No significant changes anticipated in diabetes medication regimen

          -  At Screening, subject has one ulcer on the target foot that fulfills all of the
             following criteria:

               -  Present for ≥ 2 weeks and ≤1 year

               -  Full- thickness and not involving bone, tendon, or capsule (probing to tendon or

               -  Ulcer must be 0.5 cm2 - 6.5 cm2 as measured at Screening Visit prior to
                  debridement

        Subjects will undergo protocol-defined standardized wound care during screening (for two
        weeks or longer). Subjects will be considered screen failures and will not receive study
        injections on Day 0 (baseline) if the target ulcer does not meet all entry criteria (see
        above) as well as being confirmed as non-healing.

          -  Be capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and signing the informed
             consent document prior to being subjected to any study related procedures

          -  If female of childbearing potential, negative urine pregnancy test at screening and
             using acceptable method of birth control during the study.

          -  Unhealed prior amputation;

          -  In the investigator's assessment, will require an amputation in the target leg within

          -  The study ulcer increased by 50% or more at baseline from screening, and, in the
             opinion of the investigator, the increase is due to patient noncompliance with wound
             care instructions or due to other mitigating factors that may interfere with
             interpretation of study results;

          -  Evidence of active infection (e.g., cellulitis, osteomyelitis) or deep ulceration
