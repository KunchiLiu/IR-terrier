  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the neoClose abdominal closure to the standard
      Carter-Thomason closure in a bariatric surgery gastric bypass population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both the neoClose abdominal closure to the standard Carter-Thomason closurewill be used to
      close 12 mm camera and stapler port sites upon completion of a robotic assisted laparoscopic
      gastric bypass. The procedure requires a 12 mm port be placed in the midline approximately 3
      cm cephalad to the umbilicus and a second in the right mid abdomen. Port sites will be
      closed as defined as the inability to palpate a fascial defect and the incision being air
      tight upon carbon dioxide insufflation.
