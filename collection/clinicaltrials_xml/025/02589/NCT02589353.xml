  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although salivary contents play a major role in the early stage of food digestion process,
      their role in taste perception of glucose polymers is essentially unknown. It is
      hypothesized that the differences in salivary contents, more specifically salivary amylase
      concentration and activity, influence taste perception of glucose polymers and ultimately
      eating behavior, which is related to risks in various diseases. The current project is
      designed to investigate 2 aims. Aim 1 will investigate the variation in salivary contents
      across individuals and its role in taste perception of glucose polymers. Aim 2 will focus on
      the role of salivary contents in food liking and disliking.

    <measure>Detection of glucose polymers in the presence of acarbose</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>There is only one outcome measure, that is the detection of glucose polymers. Subjects will be asked to discriminate a target sample (glucose polymers). Three samples will be applied using cotton swabs on the subjects' tongue (one at a time): 2 blanks (water + acarbose) and 1 target stimuli (glucose polymer solution + acarbose). Subjects will be asked to identify the target sample. The number of subjects who correctly identify the target stimuli will be counted and will be statistically analyzed to determine whether glucose polymer can be detected without the confounding effect of salivary alpha amylase hydrolysis.</description>
