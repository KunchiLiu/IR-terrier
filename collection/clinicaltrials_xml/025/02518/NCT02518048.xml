      The products will be applied on 6 test sites (each product on 3 test sites) once daily 6
      days a week (except Sundays) for 4 weeks. The application sites for each product will be
      determined according to random assignment. Depending on the size of the psoriasis plaques, 2
      or 4 test sites will be located within the same plaque; the treatment assignment will be
      done pair-wise.

             have a size suitable to accommodate 2 test sites (test site area 5 cm2, distance
             between two test sites at least 2 cm). For subjects with two lesions, one lesion must
             have a size suitable to accommodate 4 test sites, and the other lesion must
             accommodate 2 test sites.

          -  Age 18 years or above

          -  Outpatients

          -  Female subjects must be of either

             and during the trial

          -  Initiation of, or expected changes to concomitant medication that may affect
             psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., beta blockers, antimalarial drugs, lithium and ACE
             inhibitors) within 2 weeks prior to the randomisation and during the trial

          -  Subjects with current diagnosis of guttate, erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular
