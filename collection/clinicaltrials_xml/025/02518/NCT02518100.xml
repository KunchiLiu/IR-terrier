    <textblock>
      This feasibility study evaluates the use of the Vital Signs Patch (VSP) System to take and
      monitor specified vital signs. It will be used in parallel with the normal equipment the
      study site uses to take and monitor vital signs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility and usability of the total Vital Signs Patch (VSP) System in an
      actual hospital environment on in-patients by monitoring specified vital signs. The VSP
      System will be assessed for incorporation into the study site's Information Technology
      infrastructure. The VSP measurements will be compared with the predetermined expected
      results of the established vital signs equipment normally used by the facility based upon
      clinician protocols.

      The VSP System can take and monitor patient vital signs in a more reliable and consistent
      manner by removing the human variability that occurs when clinicians manually take a
      patient's vital signs. The VSP has been designed to automatically take and monitor the
      following vital signs:

        -  Arterial blood oxygen Saturation (SpO2)

        -  ECG (up to 3 - Lead)

        -  Heart Rate (Part of ECG)

        -  Surface Temperature

        -  Respiration
