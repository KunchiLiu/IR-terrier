  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's patients receiving ileocolonic resection are randomized into extensive mesenteric
      resection group and local mesenteric resection group.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomization was performed intraoperatively once the surgeon had determined that there were
      no other sites of disease and that either type of anastomosis could be performed safely.
      Computer generated randomization was carried out within strata using randomized permuted
      blocks to ensure balance of the groups.

      All surgery was performed by a single group of surgeons experienced in the surgical
      treatment of Crohn's disease. Surgery was performed open or laparoscopically depending on
      patient factors and surgeon preference. The resection was performed grossly normal resection
      margins, with side-to-side anastomosis. The presence of mesenteric marginal thickening with
      confirmation by naked eye assessment of the mucosal aspect of the bowel were used to
      establish the limits of the disease.
