    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, multiple sites, open label, two-arm, parallel-group,
      stratified by gender, matched pair cluster randomized, controlled study. This study will
      test the hypothesis that a fortified malt based food may improve immunity outcomes in 7-10
      year old school age children

    <time_frame>Baseline to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>A total volume 7 mL of whole blood will be collected from each participant and serum levels of ferritin, serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) will be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Dietary Diversity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary diversity score will be assessed through Individual Dietary Diversity, IDDS (a measure of the nutritional quality of the individual's diet). IDDS will be assessed based on the 'Guidelines for measuring household and individual dietary diversity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in macronutrients</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate, and fat will be assessed from 24-hour dietary recall survey. A structured interview will be conducted based on a questionnaire. Parent/LARs (legally appropriate representative), will provide the majority of information, with the child making additions to fill in the gaps. Parents/LARs will recall all food and beverage consumed by the child during previous 24 hours and the information will be recorded. Calculation on energy and the macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates and fat) will be made using Dietsoft software.</description>
