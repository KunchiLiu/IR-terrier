  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about how alcohol and its metabolite, acetate, affect the
      brain during decision making. Investigators also want to learn how bacteria in the gut,
      known as the gut microbiome, affect how alcohol and acetate change the brain during decision
      making.
