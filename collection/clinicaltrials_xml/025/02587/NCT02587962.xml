      pharmacodynamics and efficacy of birinapant when given in combination with pembrolizumab.

      This study will be conducted in two phases. The Phase 1 portion of the study will employ a
      sequential group dose-escalation design to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of birinapant administered in combination with 200 mg
      pembrolizumab, both administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion. The following
      proposed doses of birinapant are to be evaluated: 5.6, 11, 17, and 22 mg/m2

      The Phase 2 portion of the study will assess the safety and tolerability of the RP2D of
      birinapant when given in combination with pembrolizumab.
