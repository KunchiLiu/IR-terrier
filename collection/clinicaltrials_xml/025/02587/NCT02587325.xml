  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      mTOR activation has been shown to be relevant in the development and progression of
      pulmonary hypertension. Inhibition of mTOR has been shown to reverse or regress pulmonary
      hypertension in animal models. ABI-009 is an albumin-bound mTOR inhibitor with improved
      penetration in lung tissue.
