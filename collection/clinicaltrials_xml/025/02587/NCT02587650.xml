  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multi-center prospective basket trial designed to test the hypothesis
      that targeting specific kinase fusions in metastatic melanoma with pre-specified kinase
      inhibitors will result in objective tumor shrinkage and durable response. The study design
      is a 2 stage optimal design with a sample size of N=35, with n1=11 during stage I and n2=24
      during stage II. If 1 or fewer responses are observed during stage I, the trial will be
      stopped. If 6 or fewer responses are observed by the end of stage II, the trial will be
      stopped.

      This is a phase II prospective multi-center basket trial designed to test the hypothesis
      that targeting specific kinase fusions in metastatic melanoma with kinase inhibitors matched
      to the activated kinase fusion will result in tumor response. The study design is a 2-stage
      optimal design. Patients will be screened for one of the eligible fusion proteins using
      various assays developed in a CLIA-approved laboratory (targeted next-generation sequencing
      of tumor tissue, fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry) under a
      separate protocol. If identified, patients will be offered enrollment in this protocol and
      will be treated in one of five baskets.

      The dose of INC280 at 600 mg PO BID is based on the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) by
      Novartis. The dose of ceritinib at 750 mg PO daily is the FDA-approved dose for
      ALK-rearranged NSCLC resistant to intolerant to crizotinib. For regorafenib we will dose at
      160 mg PO daily (first 21 days of each 28 day cycle) which is the FDA-approved dose for both
      colon cancer and GIST. The dose of entrectinib at 600 mg PO QD is the RP2D based on two
      Phase 1 studies conducted by Ignyta.

             4 weeks before the first dose of INC280.

          -  Major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic) within 4 weeks
             prior (2 weeks for resection of brain metastases) to starting INC280. Video-assisted
             thoracic surgery (VATS) and mediastinoscopy will not be counted as major surgery and
             patients can be enrolled in the study ≥ 1 week after the procedure.

          -  Patients receiving treatment with medications that meet one of the following criteria
             and that cannot be discontinued at least 1 week prior to the start of INC280
             treatment and for the duration of the study:

          -  Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4

          -  Strong inducers of CYP3A4

          -  Proton pump inhibitors (PPI)

          -  Patients on unstable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. If patients are on
             corticosteroids for endocrine deficiencies or tumor-associated symptoms other than
             CNS related, dose must have been stabilized or decreasing for at least 5 days before
             first dose of INC280.

          -  Presence or history of carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  Known symptomatic brain metastases requiring increasing doses of steroid to manage
             CNS symptoms within 2 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases may be enrolled at the discretion of the
             Sponsor as long as the patient is stable and has not required increasing dose of
             steroids to manage CNS symptoms for at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment.

          -  Patients requiring seizure prophylaxis must be taking non-enzyme-inducing anti-
             epileptic drugs (non-EIAED). If patients were previously on EIAEDs and these have
             been discontinued, they must be discontinued for at least 1 weeks prior to INC280
             administration. If patients require an anti-epileptic medication, then a CYP3A4 non-
             EIAED can be used such as levetiracetam, valproic acid, gabapentin, topiramate or
             lacosamide.

             (where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the
             termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive serum hCG laboratory test).
             Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the study drugs are either
             teratogenic or have unknown teratogenicity. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother,
             nursing women are excluded unless they discontinue breastfeeding during the study.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 7 days after the last dose of INC280. Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
             ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

          -  Combination of any two of the following (i+ii or i+iii or ii+iii):

          -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms
             of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt; 1%), for
             example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

          -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

          -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/
             vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.

          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
             profile (e.g., age-appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical
             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6
             weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered
             not of child bearing potential.

          -  Sexually active males unless:

          -  A condom is used during intercourse while taking drug and 7 days after the last dose
             of entrectinib. Male patients should not father a child in the 7 days after the last
             dose of the study treatment.

          -  Male sterilization has taken place, with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
             the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. Condom use is also required in vasectomized
             men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
             the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
