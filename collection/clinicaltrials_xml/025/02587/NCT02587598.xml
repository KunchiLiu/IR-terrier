    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of the PIM kinase inhibitor INCB053914 in
      subjects with advanced malignancies. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 (dose
      escalation) will evaluate safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of INCB053914 and
      the recommended phase 2 dose(s) (a tolerated pharmacologically active dose that will be
      taken forward into Part 2 of the study). Part 2 (dose expansion) will further evaluate the
      safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the recommended Phase
      2 dose(s).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 years or older

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of select advanced malignancy

          -  Unresponsive to currently available therapy and there is no standard-of-care therapy
             available in the judgment of the investigator.

          -  Willingness to undergo a pretreatment bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate, or archival
             sample obtained since completion of most recent therapy (as appropriate to subjects
             with existing bone marrow disease or for whom bone marrow examination is a component
             of disease status assessment)

          -  Not currently a candidate for curative treatment

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status

               -  Part 1: 0 or 1

               -  Part 2: 0, 1, or 2

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inadequate bone marrow or organ function

          -  Received an investigational agent within 5 half-lives or 14 days, whichever is
             longer, prior to receiving the first dose of study drug

          -  Received non-biologic anticancer medication within 5 half-lives prior to receiving
             the first dose of study drug (within 6 weeks for mitomycin-C or nitrosoureas), within
             28 days for any antibodies or biological therapies

          -  Prior receipt of a PIM inhibitor

          -  Any history of disease involving the central nervous system (Part 1). Known active
             disease involving the central nervous system (Part 2).

          -  Screening corrected QT interval (QTc) interval &gt; 470 milliseconds

          -  Radiotherapy within the 2 weeks prior to initiation of treatment

          -  Chronic or current active infection requiring systemic antibiotic, antifungal, or
             antiviral treatment
