  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single randomized clinical trial (called a central randomization, random number table,
      sealed), blind (investigator and statistician do not know the intervention of each patient)
      is proposed; in adult patients admitted to health facilities with surgical or medical
      purposes, with high and very high risk of developing pressure ulcers (UPP) according to
      Braden scale, but with healthy skin at hospital entrance. Using a design of parallel groups,
      the efficacy of the administration of skin dressing protection versus conventional care
      (lubricant or moisturizer cream), will be evaluated in the prevention of pressure ulcers in
      hospitalized patients in two institutions fourth level of care.

      1. The intervention group A, will receive the application of protective skin on the areas
           of greatest risk according to the position of patient care (for example Shoulders,
           trochanters, sacrum, malleolus, heels, elbows, and occipital region). Skin protectors
           shall be prescribed by the doctor of the service, or the patient's physician, or the
           physician group skin care as is usually done in the two institutions so far. Guard
           application done by a professional research group.

        2. Usual care group Group B, will receive the application of moisturizer or lubricant
           standardized in the institutions in the same areas of risk in the intervention group.

           The two groups (A and B) will receive general care measures such as using anti bedsore
           mattress, changing position every two hours, and reduction of friction or shear.

        3. Follow up It will be conducted by nurses trained on aspects of health and
           hospitalization reported in the medical record. Monitoring is completed by the research
           staff at the time that the patient start ambulation, develop a pressure ulcer, die or
           discharge from the hospital. If the patients gets a pressure ulcer will be forwarded to
           the Institutional wound care group.

        4. Results Primary outcome: incidence of pressure ulcers from grade I to grade IV group
           (difference in risk of pressure ulcer-Hazard Ratio).

      Secondary outcome: length of hospital stay, time to event for pressure ulcer, the event time
      for the beginning of ambulation at hospital, and cost difference between the groups.
