  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ropivacaine is one of commonly used anesthetics for spinal anesthesia. Usually L2-3 or L3-4
      intervertebral space is chosen for spinal anesthesia. The efficacy of ropivacaine injected
      into subarachnoid space depends on the given dose and the chosen intervertebral space.
      Appropriate dose could satisfy the requirement of operation and reduce incidence of the
      adverse reaction. But it is not certain about the minimum effective dose of ropivacaine in
      cesarean section through the two intervertebral spaces, respectively. This study is being
      conducted to find the minimum effective doses for L2-3 and L3-4 spinal anesthesia in
      cesarean section.

      Some unexpected adverse reactions such as respiratory depression, vomiting, especially
      supine hypotensive syndrome could caused by a high dose of anesthetic in cesarean section.
      The investigators assumed that there be a minimum effective dose that will be associated
      with the best possible performance of ropivacaine for different intervertebral spaces(L2-3
      and L3-4 in usual). That maybe enhance the comfort of parturient and safety of fetus.

      This study is conducted as a prospective, randomized, up-down sequential dose of isobaric
      ropivacaine in 3 mL that will provide effective analgesia for 50% of parturients in cesarean
      section. The investigators use the combined spinal-epidural anesthesia(CSEA) technique in
      the study. The initial dose of ropivacaine is chosen as 12 mg in L2-3 group and 15 mg in
      L3-4 group, and the testing interval is 0.5 mg with subsequent doses being determined by the
      outcome of the previous injection in the same group. If the previous response is
      ineffective, the next patient will receive 0.5 mg more than the last patient. If the
      response of the previous patient is effective, the next patient decrease 0.5mg.

      The visual analogue scale (VAS) is used to rate the pain, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the
      worst pain imaginable. Criteria for evaluation:(1) effective: after spinal anesthesia
      finish, a dose that provide adequate sensory dermatomal anesthesia to pinprick to T6 or
      higher within 10 minutes, and the VAS is lower than or equal to 3 within 50minutes after
      operation begin; (2) ineffective: if the initial plane of sensory dermatomal anesthesia is
      lower than T6 or VAS is greater than 3 within 50 minutes after beginning of operationduring
      operation, the dose of ropivacaine is considered inadequate and additional lidocaine is
      given through epidural catheter.

      Motor assessments are performed at 3-minute intervals for the first 30 minutes. Thereafter,
      the blocks are assessed at 15-minute intervals until the end of surgery. Results of the
      pinprick test were determined bilaterally at midclavicular level by using a 27-gauge needle.
      Motor block in the lower limb is assessed by a modified Bromage scale (0=no paralysis,
      1=unable to raise extended leg, 2=unable to flex knee,3=unable to flex ankle). All of the
      assessments are made by an anesthetist who is blinded to the group assignment as well as to
      the dose injected. On the other hand, the investigators will compare the incidence of
      adverse reaction between the L2-3 and L3-4 group when the dose is evaluated as 'effective'.

      Using the Dixon and Massey up-and-down method study design, 60 patients scheduled for
      elective cesarean section will be included in the study, 30 for each group.
