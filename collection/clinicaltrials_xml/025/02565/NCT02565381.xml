    <textblock>
      The QUIT (Quitting with Usual Care, Incentives, and Technology) Smoking Study is a 3-arm
      pilot randomized controlled trial that will test the effect of 2 different experimental
      smoking cessation interventions relative to a control condition in homeless cigarette
      smokers. All participants will receive free transdermal nicotine patches and weekly
      in-person smoking cessation counseling. In addition, participants randomized to the first
      experimental condition will receive financial rewards for biochemically-verified smoking
      abstinence, and participants randomized to the second experimental condition will be
      enrolled in a text messaging program to support smoking abstinence.
