  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood schizophrenia &quot;early dissociative disorder&quot; is a rare disease with a low incidence
      of approximately (1 0/00 to 30/00 ). Its link with autism spectrum disorders remains unknown
      although both are serious neurodevelopmental diseases. As part of the 2011-2013
      Interregional hospital Clinical Research program, University Department of Child and
      Adolescent Psychiatry Pediatric Hospitals of CHU (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire) de Nice
      Lenval identified 15 patients with a complex phenotype characterized by an early
      schizophrenia associated with autism spectrum disorders and developmental disabilities in
      mild to moderate. This phenotype could be a new syndrome called &quot;schizotiste&quot;.

      The goal of the investigator's project is to define the genetic causes of this phenotype.
      The technique of high throughput sequencing will be used to obtain the sequence of exomes of
      these patients and their families. This study will therefore be important to give an
      accurate diagnosis for patients and their families. Moreover, investigators believe that
      this project will identify new genes involved allowing a better understanding of the
      pathophysiology. Recent studies show the involvement of mutations in several genes (eg
      Shank, NLGN, NRXN and UPF3) in these different clinical phenotypes. However, the genetic
      basis of the child's schizophrenia are much less well known than those of autism spectrum
      disorder.

    <description>The primary endpoint is based on a number of technical genetic analysis of all subjects.
A standard karyotype at a resolution of 300 to 400 bands per haploid lot is established initially. It can diagnose numerical anomalies and certain structural abnormalities such as reciprocal translocations, inversions, deletions Big.
The pathological nature of these mutations will be stutied on the gene function and reaches its pattern of expression.</description>
