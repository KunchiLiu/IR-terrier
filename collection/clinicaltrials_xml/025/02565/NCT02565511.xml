  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether two investigational drugs called CAD106 and
      CNP520, administered separately, can slow down the onset and progression of clinical
      symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in participants at the risk to develop
      clinical symptoms based on their age and genotype.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of each of the two therapies given separately, both
      targeting amyloid, on cognition, global clinical status, and underlying pathology in
      participants at risk for the onset of clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      Cognitively unimpaired individuals with two APOE4 genes and age 60 to 75 years, inclusive,
      are selected as they represent a population at particularly high risk of progression to Mild
      Cognitive Impairment and/or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.

      The study follows a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-cohort, parallel group
      design in which participants receive one of the investigational treatments or their matching
      placebo for at least 60 months up to a maximum of 96 months and no longer than when the
      target number of events for the TTE endpoint has been observed and confirmed in either
      cohort.

      An unbalanced randomization (active: placebo) of 5:3 ratio in Cohort I (430 CAD106 :260
      Placebo) and 3:2 ratio in Cohort II (390 CNP520 : 260 Placebo) will be applied.
      Randomization will be stratified by age group (60-64 years, 65-75 years) and region (North
      America/Other , Europe).

      Participants who meet study entry requirements will be required to undergo at least two PET
      scans during the course of the study. Additional PET scans, blood and CSF collection will be
      voluntary. The study (also known as the API APOE4 trial) is conducted as part of the
      Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API) program.

          -  Male or female, age 60 to 75 years inclusive. Females must be considered
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential.

          -  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) total score ≥ 24 and cognitively unimpaired as
             evaluated by memory tests performed at screening.

          -  Homozygous APOE4 genotype.

          -  Participant's willingness to have a study partner.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any disability that may prevent the participants from completing all study
             requirements.

          -  Current medical or neurological condition that might impact cognition or performance
             on cognitive assessments.

          -  Advanced, severe progressive or unstable disease that may interfere with the safety,
             tolerability and study assessments, or put the participant at special risk.

          -  History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the past 60
             months.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the investigational drugs or their excipients /
             adjuvant or to drugs of similar chemical classes.

          -  Indication for, or current treatment with ChEIs and/or another AD treatment (e.g.

             Investigator might be a leading cause to cognitive decline, might pose a risk to the
             participant, or might prevent a satisfactory MRI assessment for safety monitoring.

          -  A positive drug screen at Screening, if, in the Investigator's opinion, this is due

          -  Significantly abnormal laboratory results at Screening, not as a result of a
             temporary condition.

          -  Current clinically significant ECG findings.

        For Cohort - II only:

        • Participants with depigmenting or hypopigmenting conditions (e.g. albinism vitiligo) or
