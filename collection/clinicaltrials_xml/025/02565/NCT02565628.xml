    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data for multiple
      doses of PF-06669571 in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. In addition, this
      study will assess whether PF-06669571 is able to demonstrate superior efficacy compared with
      placebo in the treatment of the motor symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and
             presence of at least 2 out of 3 cardinal characteristics (tremor, rigidity and/or
             bradykinesia).

          -  Must be Hoehn &amp; Yahr Stage II-III inclusive and experiencing motor fluctuations in
             the form of end-of-dose wearing off during the morning hours or early morning
             akinesia.

          -  Subjects should be able to recognize their &quot;wearing off&quot; symptoms and verify that
             they usually improve after their next dose of Parkinson's disease medication.
             Subjects should be able to recognize drug-induced dyskinesias and verify whether or
             not they are troublesome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - History or clinical features consistent with an atypical parkinsonian syndrome, (for
        example: ataxia, dystonia, clinically significant orthostatic hypotension.
