  <brief_summary>

      To investigate natural killer (NK) cell activities, circulating cytokine levels and
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytokine production status in critically ill
      patients.

      Blood samples were collected &lt; 24 hours after admission from 24 intensive care unit (ICU)
      patients and 24 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls. Serum
      cytokine concentrations and cytokine production by PBMCs and lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-stimulated PBMCs were measured. The ICU group showed lower NK cell activities and an
      absence of interferon (IFN)-γ than the controls under all conditions. After adjusting for
      triglycerides, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, and glucose, the ICU group exhibited lower serum
      levels of albumin and interleukin (IL)-12 and higher leukocyte count, high sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and IL-6 than the controls. Non-stimulated PBMCs from ICU
      patients secreted significantly greater amounts of IL-6 and IL-1β than the controls,
      however, the production of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β in response to LPS
      stimulation was significantly lower in the ICU group. Significant reductions in NK cell
      activities and serum IL-12 levels, an absence of serum IFN-γ, and decreased cytokine
      production from LPS-stimulated PBMCs may indicate hyporesponsiveness in NK cells and a
      dysfunctional inflammatory response in the early phase in critically ill patients.

        From April 2014 to July 2015, 24 critically ill patients were enrolled in this study after
        admission to the ICU at Yonsei University Severance Hospital. For validation of the
        experimental findings, age-, sex- and BMI-matched healthy subjects were enrolled as
        controls among individuals seen at a health evaluation center during the same period.
