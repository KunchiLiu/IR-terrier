    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, rollover study in subjects with CF who are
      homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and who participated in Studies 103
      (NCT02070744), 106 (NCT02347657), 107 (NCT02516410), 108 (NCT02392234), 109 (NCT02412111),
      and 111 (NCT02508207). The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long
      term treatment of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor.

      This study consists of a Treatment Cohort and an Observational Cohort. The Treatment Cohort
      and the Observational Cohort will be open to enrollment in parallel.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound

          -  Participation in an investigational drug trial (including studies investigating VX
             661/ivacaftor or lumacaftor/ivacaftor) other than parent studies or 111 (NCT02508207)
             or use of a commercially available CFTR modulator.
