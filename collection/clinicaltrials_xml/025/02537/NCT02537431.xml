  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UX023-CL304 is a Phase 3 open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to establish the effects
      of KRN23 on bone quality and osteomalacia associated with XLH. Approximately 14 adult
      subjects with a diagnosis of XLH supported by typical clinical and biochemical features and
      who have not received oral phosphate and vitamin D therapy in the past two years will be
      enrolled. Iliac crest bone biopsies will be performed at baseline and end of study. Baseline
      histologic and histomorphometric assessments of the bone biopsy specimens will be performed
      as each biopsy is completed to assess sample quality and confirm the presence of
      osteomalacia in at least 8 subjects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged 18 - 65 years, inclusive

          2. Diagnosis of XLH supported by classic clinical features of adult XLH (such as short
             stature or bowed legs), and at least ONE of the following at Screening:

               -  Documented PHEX mutation in either the patient or in a directly related family
                  member with appropriate X-linked inheritance

               -  Serum intact FGF23 (iFGF23) level &gt; 30 pg/mL by Kainos assay

          3. Biochemical findings consistent with XLH based on overnight fasting (min. 8 hours):

               -  Serum phosphorus &lt; 2.5 mg/dL at Screening

               -  TmP/GFR &lt; 2.5 mg/dL at Screening

          4. Presence of skeletal pain attributed to XLH/osteomalacia, as defined by a score of ≥
             4 on the Brief Pain Inventory question 3 (BPI-Q3, Worst Pain) at Screening. (Skeletal
             pain that, in the opinion of the investigator, is attributed solely to causes other
             than XLH/osteomalacia—for example, back pain or joint pain in the presence of severe
             osteoarthritis by radiograph in that anatomical location—in the absence of any
             skeletal pain likely attributed to XLH/osteomalacia should not be considered for
             eligibility)

          5. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min (using the Chronic Kidney
             Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] equation) or eGFR of 45 to &lt;60 mL/min at
             Screening with confirmation that the renal insufficiency is not due to
             nephrocalcinosis

          6. Provide written informed consent after the nature of the study has been explained,
             and prior to any research-related procedures. If the subject in a minor, provide
             written assent and have a legally authorized representative willing and able to
             provide written informed consent, after the nature of the study has been explained,
             and prior to any research-related procedures

          7. Willing to provide access to prior medical records for the collection of biochemical
             and radiographic data and disease history

          8. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             Screening and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females
             considered not to be of childbearing potential include those who have been in
             menopause for at least two years prior to Screening, or have had tubal ligation at
             least one year prior to Screening, or have had a total hysterectomy or bilateral
             salpingo-oophorectomy.

          9. Participants of child‐bearing potential or with partners of child-bearing potential
             who have not undergone a total hysterectomy or a bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy and
             are sexually active must consent to use two effective methods of contraception as
             determined by the site investigator (i.e. oral hormonal contraceptives, patch
             hormonal contraceptives, vaginal ring, intrauterine device, physical double-barrier
             methods, surgical hysterectomy, vasectomy, tubal ligation, or true abstinence) from
             the period following the signing of the informed consent through 12 weeks after last
             dose of study drug

         10. Must, in the opinion of the investigator, be willing and able to complete all aspects
             of the study, adhere to the study visit schedule and comply with the assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of any pharmacologic vitamin D metabolite or analog (e.g. calcitriol,

          2. Use of oral phosphate within 2 years before Screening

          3. Use of aluminum hydroxide antacids, acetazolamides, and thiazides within 7 days prior
             to Screening

          4. Use of bisphosphonates in the 2 years prior to Screening

          5. Use of denosumab in the 6 months prior to Screening

             prior to Screening

          8. Corrected serum calcium level ≥ 10.8 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L) at Screening

          9. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) ≥ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
             at Screening

         10. Use of medication to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH) (cinacalcet for example)
             within 60 days prior to Screening

         11. Prothrombin time/Partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) outside the normal range at
             Screening

         12. Evidence of any disease or use of anticoagulant medication (such as warfarin,
             heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, or xabans that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, cannot be discontinued) that may increase the risk of bleeding during
             the biopsy procedure

         13. Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or
             partner) at any time during the study

         14. Unable or unwilling to withhold prohibited medications throughout the study

         15. Documented dependence on narcotics

         16. Use of KRN23, or any other therapeutic monoclonal antibody within 90 days prior to

             to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion of all
             scheduled study assessments.

             OR, in Japan, use of any investigational product or investigational medical device
             within 4 months prior to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent
             prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments.

         18. Presence or history of any hypersensitivity, allergic or anaphylactic reactions to
             any monoclonal antibody or KRN23 excipients that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects

         19. History of allergic reaction or adverse reactions to tetracycline or demeclocycline

         20. Prior history of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus antibody, hepatitis B
             surface antigen, and/or hepatitis C antibody

         21. History of recurrent infection (other than dental abscesses, which are known to be
             associated with XLH) or predisposition to infection, or of known immunodeficiency

         22. Presence of malignant neoplasm (except basal cell carcinoma)

         23. Presence of a concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study
             participation or affect safety

         24. Presence or history of any condition that, in the view of the investigator, places
             the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study
