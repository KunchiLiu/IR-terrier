  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is an essential first-line treatment for patients with knee osteoarthritis
      (OA). However, only 13% of patients meet the activity recommendation of 150 minutes or more
      per week. The primary goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the efficacy of
      a Fitbit Flex (a wireless physical activity tracking device) paired with a new application,
      plus a brief education session and telephone counselling by a physiotherapist (PT), to
      improve physical activity and reduce sedentary time in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current practice guidelines emphasize the use of exercise and weight reduction as the
      first-line management of knee osteoarthritis (OA; affecting 1 in 10 Canadians). However, up
      to 90% of people with OA are inactive. Several modifiable risk factors are associated with
      low physical activity participation, including lack of motivation, doubts about the
      effectiveness of prescribed exercises and lack of health professional advice regarding ways
      to progress their physical activity. The variety of risk factors highlights the need for a
      multifaceted approach that provides support in terms of knowledge, skill development and
      timely advice from health professionals, as well as motivational support to stay active.

      Our primary objective is to assess the efficacy of a Fitbit/MaC intervention, involving the
      use of a Fitbit Flex paired with a Monitoring and Communication application (MaC), a brief
      education session, and telephone counselling by a physiotherapist, to improve physical
      activity participation and reduce sedentary time in people with knee OA. Our secondary
      objective is to assess the effect of the intervention on patients' OA disease status and
      self-efficacy in disease management. We will carry out three aims: 1) To develop the
      Monitoring and Communication application (MaC app) to pair with Fitbit to enhance user
      experience; 2) To conduct usability tests on the navigation of the Fitbit/MaC app; 3) To
      evaluate the effect of the Fitbit/MaC intervention in patients with knee OA. In this
      proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial (RCT), the investigators hypothesize that
      compared to a control group (i.e. the Delayed Intervention Group), participants in the
      Immediate Intervention Group will 1) increase moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as
      determined by an objective measure, 2) reduce sedentary time during waking hours, 3) improve
      in OA disease status, and 4) improve in their self-efficacy of OA management.

      The investigators will use a mixed-method approach, involving a RCT and in-depth interviews.
      The proof-of-concept study will employ a stepped wedge RCT design, whereby the intervention
      will be sequentially rolled out to participants over a number of time periods. The order in
      which individuals receive the intervention will be determined at random. The strength of
      this design is that it can properly address the efficacy question, while avoiding the
      dilemma of withholding the intervention to some participants, as in a parallel group design.

    <description>Education session, Fitbit/MaC app, and remote counselling by a PT: Participants in the Immediate Intervention Group will receive this intervention in Months 1-3. The session will include a presentation on physical activity, an individual goal-setting session with a registered physiotherapist, and an orientation to the Fitbit Flex and the MaC app. In Months 1 and 2, participants will use the Fitbit/MaC app, and their physical activity information will be captured by the Fitbit and wirelessly synchronized with the MaC app. The PT will review the progress with participants via 20-minute bi-weekly phone calls, and progressively modify their activities. In Month 3, participants will continue using the Fitbit/MaC app and have access to a PT via email as needed, but no bi-weekly phone calls. In Months 4-9, participants may continue using hte Fitbit/MaC app without access to a PT.</description>
