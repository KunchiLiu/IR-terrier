      This randomized phase III trial studies the side effects of and compares apixaban and
      dalteparin in reducing blood clots in patients with cancer-related venous thromboembolism.
      Venous thromboembolism is a condition in which a blood clot forms in a vein and then breaks
      off and moves through the bloodstream. Patients with cancer are at increased risk for venous
      thromboembolism. Apixaban and dalteparin are drugs used to prevent blood clots from forming
      or to treat blood clots that have formed. It is not yet known whether apixaban or dalteparin
      is more effective in reducing blood clots in patients with cancer related venous
      thromboembolism.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Any episode of major bleeding including fatal bleeding.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary
      embolism (PE), fatal PE, or arterial thromboembolism.

      II. Any episode of major bleeding including fatal bleeding or any episode of clinically
      relevant non-major bleeding.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive apixaban orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and lower-dose
      apixaban PO BID on days 8-180.

      ARM II: Patients receive dalteparin subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-30 and
      lower-dose dalteparin SC QD on days 31-180.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.

    <description>Patients will be analyzed according to the drug they received. Major bleeding events observed after 7 days will be described separately. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model will be used to determine the point estimate for the hazard ratio (comparing apixaban to dalteparin) and the p-value for the comparison between the two arms. If the one-sided p-value is less than 0.05, then apixaban will be declared to have a lower major bleeding rate in this population.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of bleeding event defined as a major bleed or a clinically relevant non-major bleed</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 days after treatment termination</time_frame>
    <description>A stratified Cox proportional hazards model will be used to evaluate the difference in bleeding event rates. The impact of baseline covariates on the safety outcome will be described by calculating adjusted hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect. The frequencies of the separate components contributing to the safety outcome will be described. Incidence of adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA Dictionary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to the first event of the composite DVT/PE</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Analyzed using a stratified Cox's proportional hazard model. The apixaban to dalteparin hazard ratio will be computed with 95% two-sided confidence interval. The assumption of proportional hazards will be checked using graphical methods as log(-log)-plots and plots of scaled Schoenfeld residuals. The impact of baseline covariates (location of DVT, renal clearance, age, sex, mobility at randomization, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease) on the primary efficacy outcome will be described by calculating adjusted hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect.</description>
