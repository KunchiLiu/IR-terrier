    <textblock>
      The investigators are performing this research study to determine whether having low
      iron-sulfur cluster levels can cause a disease known as pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is
      defined as abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.

      Usually, small specialized structures inside each human cell called mitochondria are in
      charge of generating energy within lung arteries for normal function. During situations of
      disease or stress, lung arteries undergo a change in teh function of mitochondria, resulting
      in the development of PH. In studies on mice, investigators have learned that alterations in
      the production of specific metal complexes called iron-sulfur clusters are responsible for
      these changes. This makes it more likely that mice will develop PH.

      In this study, the investigators want to find out if alteration of iron-sulfur cluster
      formation leads to increased likelihood of developing PH in humans.

      TEST GROUP

      Study Visit One

        -  Consent by PI or Sub-Investigator

        -  Medical History Review by interview and chart review by PI/Sub-Investigator and
           Research Coordinator

        -  Physical Exam by PI or Sub-Investigator

        -  Vital Signs by research coordinator

        -  Pregnancy Test via blood for women who are of child bearing age by research coordinator

        -  Blood work (kidney/liver, blood count, coagulation, B-HCG, iron studies, and plasma for
           microRNA) processed at Presby Lab

        -  Blood draw (3.5 tablespoons) drawn by research coordinator. This blood is to isolate
           PBMCs for generation of iPSCs (in case the skin biopsy does not work). In this case,
           the investigator's lab will take the blood and skin biopsy and ship directly on ice to
           the investigator's collaborator at Yale (Yibing Qyang).

        -  ECG, done by research coordinator and read by PI/Sub-Investigator

        -  6 Minute Walk Test, done by research coordinator

        -  Skin Biopsy from underarm or inner thigh by Dr. Laura Ferris. Patients will be escorted
           by research coordinator to the 3rd floor of Falk to the Dermatology Clinic.

      All visits will occur in Outpatient Cardiology at Presby 5B clinic except the Skin Biopsy as
      noted. This visit will last 6-7 hours.

      Study Visit Two

        -  Right Heart Catheterization will be done in Presby's Cath Lab by PI/Sub-Investigator.
           Duration ~ 3 hours

             -  IF the results show that the pressure in the lung vessels is elevated without
                exercise AND there is no other abnormality in the heart function, the investigator
                will NOT need to perform exercise testing. In that case the patient will have
                resting echocardiography. (determined by PI/Sub-Investigator)

             -  In all other cases, patients will have an Exercise Right Heart Catheterization and
                a Rest and Stress Echocardiography. (Determined by PI/Sub-Investigator

        -  Resting Echocardiogram completed in the echocardiogram lab at Presby by a trained
           sonographer. Results given to PI/Sub-Investigator. Duration ~ 30-45 minutes

        -  Exercise Echocardiogram completed in Presby's cath lab. If patient unable to exercise
           medication (Dobutamine) will be given. Duration ~ 1-2 hours

        -  Exercise Right Heart Catheterization will be completed in Presby Cath Lab by Dr.
           Ishizawar. Duration ~ 2-3 hours
