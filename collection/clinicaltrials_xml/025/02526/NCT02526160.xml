    <textblock>
      UX023-CL303 is a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of KRN23 in adult subjects with XLH. Approximately 120
      subjects with a diagnosis of XLH supported by clinical and biochemical features consistent
      with XLH and/or a confirmed PHEX mutation (self or family member consistent with X-linked
      inheritance) and with bone or joint pain at baseline will be enrolled. Subjects not
      receiving supplementation therapy with oral phosphate and active vitamin D metabolites or
      those willing to discontinue supplementation therapy are eligible.

          1. Male or female, aged 18 - 65 years, inclusive

          2. Diagnosis of XLH supported by classic clinical features of adult XLH (such as short
             stature or bowed legs) and at least ONE of the following at Screening:

               -  Documented phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X
                  chromosome (PHEX) mutation in the patient or a directly related family member
                  with appropriate X-linked inheritance

               -  Serum intact FGF23 (iFGF23) level &gt; 30 pg/mL by Kainos assay

          3. Biochemical findings consistent with XLH at Screening Visit 2 following overnight
             fasting (min. 8 hours):

               -  Serum phosphorus &lt; 2.5 mg/dL

               -  TmP/GFR of &lt; 2.5 mg/dL

          4. Presence of skeletal pain attributed to XLH/osteomalacia, as defined by a score of ≥
             4 on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Questions 3 (Worst Pain) at Screening Visit 1.
             (Skeletal pain that, in the opinion of the investigator, is attributed solely to
             causes other than XLH/osteomalacia—for example, back or joint pain in the presence of
             severe osteoarthritis by radiograph in that anatomical location—in the absence of any
             skeletal pain likely attributed to XLH/osteomalacia should not be considered for
             eligibility)

          5. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min (using the Chronic Kidney
             Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] equation) or eGFR of 45 60 mL/min at
             Screening Visit 2 with confirmation that the renal insufficiency is not due to
             nephrocalcinosis

          6. If taking chronic pain medications (including narcotic pain medications/opioids),

             willing to maintain medications at the same stable dose(s) and schedule throughout
             the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period of the study. The dose must not exceed 60 mg
             oral morphine equivalents/day

          7. Provide written informed consent or if a minor, provide written consent and have a
             legally authorized representative willing and able to provide written informed
             consent, after the nature of the study has been explained, and prior to any
             research-related procedures

          8. Willing to provide access to prior medical records for the collection of biochemical
             and radiographic data and disease history

          9. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             Screening and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females
             considered not to be of childbearing potential include those who have been in
             menopause for at least two years prior to Screening, or have had tubal ligation at
             least one year prior to Screening, or have had a total hysterectomy or bilateral
             salpingo-oophorectomy

         10. Participants of child‐bearing potential or with partners of child-bearing potential
             who have not undergone a bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy and are sexually active must
             consent to use an effective method of contraception as determined by the site
             investigator (i.e. oral hormonal contraceptives, patch hormonal contraceptives,
             vaginal ring, intrauterine device, physical double-barrier methods, surgical
             hysterectomy, vasectomy, tubal ligation, or true abstinence) from the period
             following the signing of the informed consent through 12 weeks after last dose of
             study drug

         11. Must, in the opinion of the investigator, be willing and able to complete all aspects
             of the study, adhere to the study visit schedule and comply with the assessments

             surface antigen, and/or hepatitis C antibody
