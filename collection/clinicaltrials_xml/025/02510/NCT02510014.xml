    <textblock>
      A multi-center, open-label, long-term safety study in which approximately 600 subjects
      diagnosed with opioid use disorder will be enrolled. Following a screening period, all
      subjects will receive run in SUBOXONE sublingual film followed by monthly injections of
      open-label high dose RBP-6000. RBP-6000 dose can be adjusted to low dose, and back to high
      dose, based on the medical judgment of the Investigator. Subjects will participate in the
      study for either 6 or 12 months.

      Approximately 600 subjects diagnosed with opioid use disorder will be enrolled;
      approximately 300 subjects who completed the randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study, RB-US-13-0001, and approximately 300 subjects who did not participate in study
      RB-US-13-0001. Following informed consent and completion of screening procedures, all
      subjects will receive SUBOXONE sublingual film, titrated to response.

      After 4-14 days of SUBOXONE film treatment, subjects will be evaluated for enrollment into
      the study.Eligible subjects will receive high dose RBP-6000 as an initial dose, followed by
      monthly injections of low or high dose RBP-6000, based on the medical judgment of the
      investigator.

      Subjects who participated in study RB-US-13-0001 will receive monthly injections for up to 6
      months. Subjects who did not participate in study RB-US-13-0001 will receive monthly
      injections for up to12 months.

      At all injection visits continuous electrocardiogram recordings and pulse oximetry will be
      collected prior to injection and at least 4 hours after injection. Subjects will return to
      the clinic every 1-4 weeks for laboratory tests, complete study questionnaires,adverse event
      and injection site assessments.
