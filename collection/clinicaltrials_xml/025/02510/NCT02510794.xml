  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of
      three different formulations of ranibizumab delivered via the Ranibizumab Port Delivery
      System (RPDS) implant compared with the standard of care (SOC) intravitreal (ITV) injections
      of ranibizumab, in participants with subfoveal neovascular age-related macular degeneration
      (AMD).

          -  Newly diagnosed with wet AMD within 6 months of screening visit

          -  Participant must have received at least 2 prior anti-VEGF injections. The most recent
             anti-VEGF injection must have been ranibizumab and must have occurred at least 7 days
             prior to the screening visit

          -  Participant may have received up to 6 ITV anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth factor
             (VEGF) injections prior to the screening visit

          -  Demonstrated response to prior SOC ITV anti-VEGF treatment

          -  Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
             (ETDRS) charts of 20/25-20/200 Snellen equivalent at the screening visit

          -  Willingness and ability to provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with ITV anti-VEGF agents other than ranibizumab within 1 month prior to
             the randomization visit in either eye

          -  Study eye treatment with ITV anti-VEGF agents other than ranibizumab within 1 month
             prior to the randomization visit

          -  History of laser photocoagulation, Visudyne®, ITV corticosteroid injection,
             vitrectomy surgery, submacular surgery, device implantation, or other surgical
             intervention for AMD in the study eye

          -  Prior participation in a clinical trial involving anti-angiogenic drugs, other than
             ranibizumab, in either eye within 2 months of the randomization visit

          -  Subretinal hemorrhage in the study eye that involves the center of the fovea

          -  Subfoveal fibrosis, or atrophy in the study eye

          -  choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in either eye due to other causes, such as ocular
             histoplasmosis, trauma, or pathologic myopia

          -  Uncontrolled ocular hypertension or glaucoma in the study eye

          -  Uncontrolled blood pressure

          -  Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation within 3 months of informed consent

          -  History of myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 3 months prior to informed
             consent

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition
             that contraindicates the use of ranibizumab or placement of the Implant, that might
             affect interpretation of the results of the study or renders the participant at high
             risk of treatment complications

          -  Use of oral corticosteroids

          -  Current treatment for any active systemic infection

          -  Use of anticoagulants, anti-platelets (other than aspirin), or medications known to
             exert similar effects

          -  Active malignancy within 12 months of randomization

          -  History of allergy to fluorescein

          -  Previous participation in any non-ocular (systemic) disease studies of
             investigational drugs within 1 month preceding the informed consent (excluding
             vitamins and minerals)
