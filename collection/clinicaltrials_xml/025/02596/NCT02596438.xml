      The &quot;Thousand Asian American Study&quot; or &quot;TAAS&quot; aims to better understand the factors
      associated with testing for hepatitis B viral (HBV) testing among foreign-born Asian and
      African adult residents of Sacramento county, characteristics of those infected with HBV,
      and the efficacy of follow-up and linkage to care for those infected with HBV, and develop a
      research platform for future studies. Thus, what the investigators want to do is 1) test
      2000 foreign-born Sacramento county residents for HBV and (2) counsel at least 90% of those
      whose screening results are positive for HBV. The investigators want to better characterize
      factors associated with HBV testing and factors that may differentiate those determined to
      be free of infection, infected with HBV, and those with resulting primary liver cancer.
