      This is a Phase IV multicenter, open-label study and is being implemented in order to assess
      diagnostic image quality of MDCTA in subjects undergoing computed tomography angiography
      (CTA) of the thoraco-abdominal aorta, and the carotid, pulmonary and peripheral arteries
      with IOMERON.

      This is a Phase IV multicenter, open-label study and is being implemented in order to assess
      diagnostic image quality of MDCTA in subjects undergoing computed tomography angiography
      (CTA) of the thoraco-abdominal aorta, and the carotid, pulmonary and peripheral arteries
      with IOMERON. The hypothesis is that IOMERON used at a high concentration will provide good
      diagnostic image quality. The Investigators will also function as readers and evaluate the
      images on-site. Efficacy analysis will be based on the on-site evaluations.

      Imaging conditions will be representative of those used in routine clinical practice. The
      study will be conducted at approximately 10-20 sites in China. Each site may enroll
      approximately 40 subjects in this study. Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled in
      order to obtain 360 evaluable subjects who undergo elective MDCTA of the thoraco-abdominal
      aorta, or carotid, pulmonary or peripheral arteries.

    <description>0 = Insufficient: Impaired image quality precludes adequate diagnostic assessment of vascular abnormalities (stenosis, embolism, dissection, etc.) because of severe noise, or severe artifacts, or insufficient contrast enhancement.
= Adequate: Image quality is sufficient for adequate diagnostic assessment of vascular abnormalities (stenosis, embolism, dissection etc.), even in presence of minimal noise, or minimal artifacts and sufficient contrast enhancement.
= Good: Image quality allows adequate, complete and rapid diagnostic assessment of vascular abnormalities (stenosis, embolism, dissection etc.) with absent or very minimal noise, or absent or very minimal artifacts, and optimal contrast enhancement.</description>
