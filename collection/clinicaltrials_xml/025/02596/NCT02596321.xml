      To demonstrate superiority of ALK HDM tablets versus placebo in the immune response,
      measured as change of D. Farinae specific IgG4 from baseline to end of treatment with ALK
      HDM tablets given once daily over 60 days

      To evaluate the immune response, measured as change of D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae specific
      immunoglobulin E (IgE) and D. pteronyssinus specific IgG4 from baseline to end of treatment
      with ALK HDM tablets given once daily over 60 days, compared to placebo

      To evaluate in patients with HDM-allergic respiratory disease the safety and tolerability of
      60-day treatment with ALK HDM tablets compared to placebo
