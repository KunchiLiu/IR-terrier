    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, open label study will enroll patients with neovascular AMD who
      are naïve to anti-VEGF therapy or have not received intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for the
      previous 3 months. Patients will be randomized in two treatment arms for 3 months:

        -  Study arm 1: Three monthly injections of 0.5mg Ranibizumab

        -  Study arm 2: Three monthly injections of 0.5mg Conbercept Blood sample (plasma/serum)
           will be collected at baseline (pre-dose), 3h post-injections and days 1, 3, 7 and 28,
           following doses 1 and 3 for PK and systemic VEGF analysis. The lab staff will be
           blinded for treatment allocation.

      Plasma VEGF concentration will be measured by a blinded laboratory using Quantikine® ELISA
      kits. Serum ranibizumab and conbercept concentration will be determined using validated
      ELISA assay.

      The study will be divided into 2 stages: the 1st initial feasibility stage with 6 patients
      per arm (12 patients in total) to verify SD for sample size justification and 2nd stage to
      confirm the findings with justified sample size.
