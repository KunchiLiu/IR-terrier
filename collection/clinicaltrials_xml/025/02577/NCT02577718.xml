  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this Phase I/II pilot study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      a non- antibiotic chelator based lock solution that contains nitroglycerin in combination
      with sodium citrate and ethanol (NiCE lock solution) for prevention of central line
      associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

        -  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and estimate the rate of
           adverse events associated with the NiCE lock solution.

        -  The second primary objective is to estimate the rate of CLABSI in patients receiving
           the NiCE lock solution.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug-Related Hypotension</measure>
    <time_frame>within 10 minutes of each flush</time_frame>
    <description>Drug-related hypotension is defined as a significant drop in measured blood pressure (BP) that exceeds the normal BP variability of a patient by 30%, that is associated with clinical signs and symptoms (dizziness and syncope) and is unexplained by factors other than the lock solution (such as other antihypertensive drugs, sepsis, bleeding). BP variability will be based on the standard deviation (SD) of a patient's blood pressure measured in the 3 days preceding participation in this trial and will be calculated at the time of trial entry.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Catheter-Associated Infections</measure>
    <time_frame>60 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Catheter-Associated Infections will be measured by microbiological culture defined as either Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI) as defined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), particularly in neutropenic patients, or Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), particularly in non-neutropenic patients</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inpatients who have a long term central venous catheter (CVC)â€”and the CVC has been in
             place for at least 14 days and is expected to remain in place at least for 30 days
             after enrollment

          -  The CVC consists of a 5.0 French size, dual-lumen, peripherally inserted central
             catheter

          -  Patients who are willing and capable to provide Informed Consent

          -  Patients who are willing and capable to follow the instructions required to complete
             the study

          -  Females (of child bearing potential) and males (of child bearing potential) must be
             abstinent or agree to use birth control during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have an antimicrobial CVC.

          -  Patients who have a short term CVC that have been placed in ICU (mainly rigid wall
             CVCs placed for acute care in ICU).

          -  Patients who are hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure reading of &lt;110 mmHg at
             any time over the 3 days prior to study entry

          -  Patients who are not awake, not alert, or who cannot express pain or discomfort
             related to the catheter locks

          -  Patients with an existing local or systemic infection as defined by evidence of fever
             (a body temperature &gt; 38.0o C with two readings taken at least 10 minutes apart or
             one body temperature &gt; 38.3o) and any of the following within 24 hours of enrollment:
             Pulse rate &gt; 100 beats/min.; Respiratory rate &gt; 20/min.; WBC count &gt;12,000/mm3,
             &lt;4,000/mm3 or differential count showing &gt;10% band forms. Patient will still be
             eligible for the study if the participant's white blood cell count (WBC) is outside
             normal limits due to chemotherapy treatment or underlying conditions. Systolic blood
             pressure &lt;90 mm Hg.

             erythema, swelling, purulent exudates within 2 cm of entry site)

          -  Patients with an occluded (partially or totally) catheter defined as inability to
             either withdraw blood or instill 3cc of fluid without resistance through any catheter
             lumen

          -  Patients with multiple co-existing central venous catheters at the time of enrollment
             will not be enrolled.

          -  Patients in whom the lock solution application will interfere with routine treatment
             of the underlying disease

          -  Patients with a known history of allergic reaction to ethanol, nitroglycerin, or
             citrate.
