  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no golden universal standard for the diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). In
      this scenario, for a comparison of the effectiveness of the principal diagnostic tests CTS
      should determine how they affect the likelihood of disease through a clinical accuracy trial
      of good methodological quality in order to get answers to what is the best diagnostic
      strategy in clinical CTS practice. The paresthesia in nerve distribution territory median
      hands is the most common symptom in patients with CTS. The nuisance caused by paresthesia
      directly affects the quality of life of patients and impairs daily manual activities and
      sleep quality. To evaluate the remission of paresthesia is a major clinical criterion for
      improved STC being an expected relevant outcome for the patient. This study evaluates and
      compares the diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination (CE), ultrasound (US) and
      electromyography (EMG), considering the postoperative status of remission of paresthesia as
      the golden standard in the diagnosis of CTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is characterized by median nerve compression at the level of
      the wrist. It represents 90% of compressive neuropathies and is the most common upper
      member. For being a major cause of disability in hands, the early and accurate diagnosis to
      obtain a definitive treatment in CTS is essential. Despite this, there is no consensus on
      which is the most effective diagnostic criteria for CTS. The absence of a golden standard,
      universally accepted for the diagnosis of CTS contributes to this scenario. The CTS
      diagnostic practice is controversial because of the inconsistent and large variations in the
      clinical presentation of signs and symptoms as well as the performance of clinical trials.

      The clinical diagnosis is mainly represented by symptoms of numbness in the median nerve
      distribution territory in the hand and the positivity of provocative tests of Phalen and
      Tinel and varies considerably in performance and accuracy of the sensitivity values (10-80%)
      and specificity (55 to 86%). Ultrasonography (US) and electromyography (EMG) are the
      complementary examinations most often used in the diagnosis of CTS, but overestimated in
      their performance and require caution in interpreting the results, particularly the lack of
      a consensus on the ideal cutoff point for considering the diagnosis of CTS. This results in
      a wide variation in results of sensitivity and specificity for these tests, both the EMG
      (sensitivity = 82 to 98% and specificity = 19 to 88%) and for the US (sensitivity = 70 to
      98% and specificity = 63 to 100%), in addition to a high proportion (20-40%) of
      false-negative and false-positive.

      Most diagnostic accuracy studies at CTS compare the results of the US with EMG, considering
      most of the time the EMG as a standard of reference. There are few studies comparing the
      results of the US and EMG using other benchmarks, such as the degree of clinical improvement
      after surgical treatment of CTS or a combination of clinical signs and symptoms. The value
      of diagnostic tests for CTS can be established by comparing the diagnostic strategies and
      studying how they can affect the likelihood of STC. This spectrum can be considered the
      results of surgical treatment as the golden standard, as these are directly related to the
      diagnosis of CTS. Surgical treatment by classical open surgery is the definitive treatment
      of CTS and provides relief from symptoms, mainly the remission of paresthesia, with
      satisfactory results in up to 98% of the cases. The discomfort caused by paresthesia in the
      quality of life of patients and impairs daily manual activities and the quality of sleep is
      considerable in CTS. The remission of paresthesia is a clinical improvement parameter of the
      disease being an expected and relevant outcome for the patient. Primary and well-designed
      controlled studies with good methodological quality to guide the diagnostic practices and
      evaluate their effectiveness in an integrated manner in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are
      unusual and challenging in the current literature. This study protocol, innovative in its
      method has as primary objective to determine the effectiveness of the clinical examination
      (CE), the ultrasound (US) and electromyograph (EMG) for evaluating and comparing the best
      performance and diagnostic accuracy.

      The study design is a clinical trial of accuracy, primary, longitudinal, controlled,
      prospective, and performed in a single center. This clinical trial follows the accuracy
      STARD recommendations (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy).

      The diagnostic interventions such as initial clinical evaluation will be performed by an
      experienced hand surgeon and consist of medical history with the application and avaliation
      of 6 clinical diagnostic criteria for CTS according to Graham et al (CTS 6) that are:
      paresthesia, night paresthesia, weakness and/or atrophy thenar musculature, Tinel signal,
      Phalen test and loss of 2-points discrimination.

      The ultrasonography (US) of the wrist for patients in the study group and the control group
      will be considered for evaluation of diagnostic accuracy, US examinations of the wrist
      conducted randomly by experienced and reputable origin for any reason during the period of 6
      months prior to initial clinical evaluation. If not performe US, a futher examination will
      be required after the initial clinical evaluation. For the diagnosis of CTS will be
      considered as the cutoff point value greater than or equal to 10.0 mm² diameter of the
      median nerve (direct method) in the proximal anatomical limit of the carpal tunnel at the
      wrist as having STC.

      The electromyography (EMG) of the upper limbs for patients in the study group and the
      control group will be considered for evaluation of diagnostic accuracy, EMG examination of
      the upper limbs conducted randomly by experienced and reputable origin for any reason within
      six months preceding the initial clinical evaluation. If not performed EMG, a further
      examination will be required after the initial clinical evaluation. For the diagnosis of CTS
      will be considered as the cutoff point to measure the sensory conduction velocity (second
      finger-wrist segment) equal to or less than 50 m / s as having STC.

      After the examinations of US and EMG, only patients in the study group shall be submitted to
      surgical treatment for CTS. The surgery will be of an ambulatory character, with Bier local
      intravenous anesthetic technique, with the use of xylocaine 1% without vasoconstrictor and
      intravenous sedation. The surgical technique is surgical decompression via classical open
      surgery for carpal tunnel. All patients will receive medical discharge on the same day as
      the day of surgery. During the medical discharge process, the patient and his companion are
      given information about the surgery, postoperative care and day and time of the outpatient
      visit for dressing. The first dressing is performed after one week of the date of surgery
      and the stitches are removed after 2 weeks. Each patient will be followed on an outpatient
      basis and monthly to the 4th month after surgery.

      The statistical methodology and characteristics of the patients will be evaluated
      descriptively. For categorical variables, relative, absolute frequencies, and numeric
      variables will be presented as summary measures (mean and standard deviation). To compare
      the accuracies of the US and EMG the McNemar test will be used. Clinical diagnosis of CTS
      will be compared with the US and EMG using the chi-square test. Will be calculated the
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative in two diagnostic groups by
      calculating paired samples, using as a reference the standard surgical treatment and
      comparing this with the results of US and EMG. The calculations of positive and negative
      predictive value showing the probability of the patient having or not CTS when the result is
      positive (with disease) and negative (no disease) respectively. The accuracy between the
      clinical diagnosis and the US and between the clinical diagnosis and EMG will be evaluated
      by Kappa coefficient. To compare the proportion of correct diagnoses between the 2 groups
      the chi-square test will be used. The effectiveness of clinical examination shall be
      calculated by comparing the percentage of true positive cases of surgical treatment compared
      to true positives cases found by clinical examination, US and EMG. The summary measures will
      be accompanied by their 95% confidence interval. Will be considered p &lt;0.05 as significant.

      The sample size calculation was carried out considering the difference of at least 20% in
      the accuracy of diagnostic tests for the clinical diagnosis with statistical power of 84.4%
      and 5% significance level. To do so, a total of 145 patients with CTS divided into 115
      patients for the study group and 30 patients for the control group, will be required.

      There is a lack of accuracy of properly designed studies with good quality evidence to
      recommend good diagnostic practices in CTS. This study protocol presents the innovative
      proposal of conducting a clinical trial of accuracy, specifically designed when there is no
      golden standard defined for the diagnosis of the CTS, using the reference paresthesia after
      surgery as a relevant outcome from the standpoint of the patient. The use of more accurate
      diagnostic criteria with a more effective diagnostic protocol for the clinical examination,
      the US and the EMG, based on a high level of evidence will lead directly into the paradigm
      shift for clinical decision-making, effective and safe CTS treatment.

    <description>To evaluate the effectiveness of the CE in STC will need to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of CE with the remission of paresthesia as the gold standard for the diagnosis of CTS.
The accuracy of CE will be given by comparing the pre-operative results of these tests (presence or absence of CTS) in relation to remission or not of paresthesia (gold standart) until the fourth month postoperatively. To determine accuracy, the negative Phalen test and the absence of paresthesia reported by the patient in this period will be considered as &quot;cure&quot; (true positive). The positive Phalen test and not regression paresthesia referred by patients in this period will be considered as non-healing (false positive). For the clinical diagnosis of CTS will be assigned positive / negative or present / absent without unit of measurement.</description>

    <description>Patients in the study group will respond to Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) translated and validated for Portuguese preoperative (after initial clinical evaluation) and postoperative (4th month PO). It is a disease specific questionnaire, self-administered, and evaluates the severity of the symptoms and functional status of patients with CTS. The BCTQ assesses the symptoms and the severity, frequency, time and type. The functional degree of scale evaluates how the syndrome affects daily life. Issues relating to the severity scale are composed of 11 questions. Each question has five answers, placed in order of increasing severity of symptoms. The issues relating to the functional status are composed of 8 questions, each of which corresponds to a functional activity. Each activity has a 5-degree-answer of difficulty progressively worsening.</description>
