  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient navigation (PN) has been shown to improve rates of cancer screening in vulnerable
      populations. Most cancer PN programs are located in community health centers and focus on a
      single cancer. We will evaluate the impact of PN program on breast, cervical, and/or
      colorectal cancer screening in vulnerable patients receiving care in a large, academic,
      primary care network using a population-based IT system.

      It is important to note that the TopCare system is currently the standard of care in the
      MGPC-PBRN. As such, this proposal does not involve evaluating the TopCare system or the
      patients and providers using it. Rather, the study evaluates the part of the TopCare system
      that involves the automated identification and referral to PN of patients at increased risk
      of screening non-adherence. All eligible patients overdue for cancer screening tests will
      receive usual care that includes a reminder letter and referral to a scheduling delegate for
      follow-up. Since the TopCare system represents usual care for patients with the MGH primary
      care network, no patient contact will occur solely for research purposes. The study will
      involve randomly assigning patients overdue for screening and identified as high risk for
      not completing screening to early or delayed PN. We believe this random assignment is
      ethical because PN is an extremely limited resource, and all patients in our network
      identified as high risk for not completing screening could not be contacted by our
      navigators in a short period of time. Thus we will randomly assign access to PN during the
      study period, and then allow all patients to be navigated after the study period is over. As
      a result, all overdue, high risk patients will be referred for PN, but the timing of the
      referral will be randomly assigned. In this study, our objectives are to improve our
      algorithm to automatically identify patients who are more likely to benefit from PN
      (Specific Aim 1), and to evaluate the clinical impact of PN in a randomized controlled trial
      within our MGPC-PBRN (Specific Aim 2). We will also survey all patients identified by the
      TopCare algorithm to assess their overall satisfaction with healthcare to determine whether
      PN impacts satisfaction with healthcare (Specific Aim 3).

      Revising and improving our current 'high risk' algorithm to automatically identify patients
      who may be helped by PN in Specific Aim 1 will help us to most effectively utilize our
      limited PN resources. The current algorithm utilizes information about patient age, number
      of overdue tests, primary language, and no-show visit history. We will investigate adding
      patient registration information about insurance and education status to better identify
      patients at high risk for not completing screening.

      In Specific Aim 2, we will randomize eligible patients from our MGPC-PBRN primary care
      practices to either Arm 1 - TopCare with PN: Patients identified as at high risk for not
      completing screening by our automated algorithm will be assigned to a PN list for contact to
      help schedule and complete screening (breast, cervical, and colon), or Arm 2 - TopCare
      without PN: These patients will benefit from the standard features of the TopCare system,
      including automated identification of overdue patients, patient reminder letters, and
      referral to a scheduling delegate. All high risk patients in this arm will be eligible for
      PN after the study period is over.

    <description>The primary outcome was the overall cancer screening test completion rate over the follow-up period for each eligible patient, with all eligible cancers combined in intention to treat analyses. For example, a patient who was eligible for a total of 3 screening tests at a given time could have a completion rate of 0% (none of the 3 tests completed) 33%, 67%, or 100% (all 3 tests completed).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients ages 21-75 seen in MGPC practices in the past 3 years, and 1) linked
             to a specific PCP, or 2) linked to a specific practice (for patients who are not
             linked to a specific PCP)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are 1) subsequently identified as having died prior to the study
             intervention using the Social Security Death Index, or 2) listed in the MGH
             registration system as having a PCP outside of the MGPC-PBRN network. Patients 76
             years of age or older are excluded because cancer screening may not be appropriate
             due to other medical problems that are more prevalent with increasing age and because
             less information is available on the benefits of routine screening in older
             individuals. Additionally, patients that receive care at MGH Chelsea HC will be
             excluded since they already have PN on-site for comprehensive cancer screening.
