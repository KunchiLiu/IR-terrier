    <textblock>
      Phase II gene therapy study, involving a total of 6 male patients with choroideremia. The
      study will be conducted at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami. Patients
      will be required to attend a total of 11 study visits over a 24 month period with an
      additional 3 year follow-up.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open label study involving patients with a clinical phenotype of
      choroideremia and a confirmed CHM genotype. Following consent, patients will be required to
      attend an initial screening visit (Visit 1). Within 2 weeks of the screening visit patients
      will undergo a surgical procedure (Visit 2) under general anesthesia which will include a
      standard vitrectomy, retinal detachment and administration of a subretinal injection of
      AAV2-REP1 (1x1011 genome particles). Patients will be required to attend a further 9 study
      visits (Visits 3-11) over a 24 month period for functional, and anatomical assessments as
      well as monitoring of adverse events. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in
      visual acuity in the study eye, compared to control eye. Secondary study endpoints are,
      change from baseline in autofluorescence evaluation, microperimetry readings and other
      anatomic and functional outcomes (all in the study eye compared to control eye). Secondary
      endpoints also include safety assessments to be conducted throughout the study. The fellow
      eyes of these patients will be utilized as controls in this study and will receive no study
      treatment.
