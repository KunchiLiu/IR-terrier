      OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the effect and cost-utility of positional therapy comparing the sleep position
      trainer (SPT) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), mandibular repositioning
      appliance (MRA) and the combination SPT and MRA in patients with moderate positional
      obstructive sleep apnea (POSA).

      HYPOTHESIS:

      The SPT is more cost-effective and effective, in means of reduction of the apnea-hypopnea
      index (AHI), quality of life and compliance, compared with CPAP and MRA.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      A multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be performed with a follow-up of 12
      months per patient. Patients will be randomized for CPAP, MRA, SPT or the combination SPT
      and MRA. All outcomes will be measured at baseline, month 3, 6 and 12.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Patients diagnosed with moderate POSA according to polysomnography (PSG) results.

      INTERVENTION / STANDARD INTERVENTION TO BE COMPARED TO:

      The SPT trains POSA patients to sleep in non-supine positions, CPAP uses positive airway
      pressure to open the airway; MRA is an intra-oral prosthesis, which holds the mandible in a
      protrusive position, all to prevent effectively apneic events.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      AHI, compliance, quality-adjusted life year (QALY), direct and indirect costs,
      cardiovascular parameters, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)

      SAMPLE SIZE / DATA ANALYSIS:

      100 subjects in each treatment group, total of 400 patients.

      COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS / BUDGET IMPACT ANALYSIS:

      The SPT is expected to improve the cost-effectiveness of overall treatment of POSA patients,
      and will save annually approximately 35-150 million euros.

    <description>The SPT is a sensor that measures the sleeping position, and gives the user feedback about wrong positions with a soft vibration. A user is then able to react to the signal and turn into a non-supine position. It makes use of a sleep-in period and a training program. To stimulate compliance, information is provided about nightly behaviour, implicating a learning pattern by viewing the data on a home computer.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>CPAP functions as a pneumatic splint to maintain upper airway patency. Possible side effect can be related to the interface (skin abrasion from contact with the mask, claustrophobia, mask leak, irritated eyes), pressure (nasal congestion and rhinorrhea with dryness or irritation of the nasal and pharyngeal membranes, sneezing, gastric and bowel distension, recurrent ear and sinus infections) and negative social factors.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Mandibular advancement</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>MRA or oral appliances (OA) have become increasingly popular as a treatment alternative. By advancing the mandible and its attached soft tissue structures forward they aim to increase upper airway size. Side effects have been reported with use of MRA: excessive salivation or dryness of the mouth, gum irritation, discomfort of the temparomandibular joint, teeth of facial musculature and bite change.</description>
