  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Split thickness skin grafting is the normal standard of care for wound closure. However,
      this is an invasive procedure and associated with pain also there can be additional donor
      site morbidity. Epidermal grafting is an emerging clinical alternative that is gaining
      clinical practise. Epidermal grafting (EG) is an alternative method of autologous skin
      grafting that 'harvests' a finer layer of skin than traditional Split thickness skin
      grafting (SSG). This potentially results in less pain and reduced donor site morbidity but
      only delivers several cell layers to the wound so may be less effective at healing a wound.
      It is not known if EG is an effective alternative to SSG.

      Further the mechanism to achieve wound healing may be different. EG promotes wound healing
      by expressing growth factors that accelerates wound healing and encourages keratinocyte
      migration. Whereas SSG is a transplant of several skin layers that integrated to the
      existing wound bed as a formal skin covering.

      The investigators wish to compare these two clinical practises; epidermal grafting and split
      thickness skin grafting in wound healing. Further to undertake a translational study to
      investigate the mechanism by which each technique achieves wound healing.

      This study evaluates the efficacy of EG, as an alternative to current wound management
      therapy, SSG. In a pilot study carried out in our centre (unpublished data), the
      investigators noted that this technique offers a method of autologous skin harvesting with
      minimal or no pain and a scar free donor site. Moreover, complete wound epithelialisation
      was achieved while maintaining patient independence. Therefore, this device has the
      potential to save healthcare resources, by eliminating the need for theatre space and a
      hospital bed, and result in better Patient Reported Outcomes Measures.
