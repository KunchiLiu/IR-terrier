    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of YKP3089
      as adjunctive therapy in subjects with partial onset seizures. Initially, subjects taking
      phenytoin or phenobarbital will be enrolled followed by additional subjects taking
      anti-epileptic drugs other than phenytoin and phenobarbital to further investigate long-term
      safety.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male or female and greater than or equal to 18 years of age at the time of signing
             the informed consent. The upper age limit is 70 years inclusive.

          2. Weight at least 30 kg

          3. Written informed consent signed by the subject or legal guardian prior to entering
             the study in accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines. If the written informed consent
             is provided by the legal guardian because the subject is unable to do so, a written
             or verbal assent from the subject must also be obtained. In Germany, only the subject
             may sign the informed consent form in accordance with ICH guidelines.

          4. A diagnosis of partial epilepsy according to the International League Against
             Epilepsy's Classification of Epileptic Seizures. Diagnosis should have been
             established by clinical history and an electroencephalogram (EEG) that is consistent
             with localization related epilepsy; normal interictal EEGs will be allowed provided
             that the subject meets the other diagnosis criterion (ie, clinical history).

          5. Have uncontrolled partial seizures and require additional AED therapy despite having
             been treated with at least one AED within approximately the last 2 years.

          6. Currently on stable antiepileptic treatment regimen:

               1. Subject must have been receiving stable doses of 1 to 3 AEDs for at least 3
                  weeks prior to Visit 2

               2. Vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) will not be counted as an AED; however, the
                  parameters must remain stable for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline. The VNS
                  must have been implanted at least 5 months prior to Visit 1.

               3. Benzodiazepines taken at least once per week during the 1 month prior to Visit 1
                  for epilepsy, or for anxiety or sleep disorder, will be counted as 1 AED and
                  must be continued unchanged throughout the study. Therefore only a maximum of 2
                  additional approved AEDs will be allowed.

          7. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed within
             the past 10 years that ruled out a progressive cause of epilepsy. If a CT or MRI has
             not been performed within the past 10 years, one must be performed prior to
             randomization.

          8. Ability to reach subject by telephone.

          9. Use of an acceptable form of birth control by female subjects of childbearing
             potential

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. History of any serious drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction (including but not
             limited to Stevens Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with
             eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) or any drug-related rash requiring
             hospitalization.

          2. History of any drug-induced rash or hypersensitivity reaction.

          3. History of a first degree relative with a serious cutaneous drug-induced adverse
             reaction.

          4. History of serious systemic disease, including hepatic insufficiency, renal
             insufficiency, a malignant neoplasm, any disorder in which prognosis for survival is
             less than 3 months, or any disorder which in the judgment of the investigator will
             place the subject at excessive risk by participation in a controlled trial

          5. Subjects taking phenytoin must not be taking phenobarbital or primidone; subjects
             taking phenobarbital must not be taking phenytoin or primidone

          6. Subjects taking concomitant AEDs other than phenytoin or phenobarbital, must not be
             taking phenytoin or phenobarbital or primidone

          7. Subjects with clinical evidence of phenytoin or phenobarbital toxicity

          8. A history of nonepileptic or psychogenic seizures

          9. Presence of only nonmotor simple partial seizures or primary generalized epilepsies

         10. Presence of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome

         12. Subjects implanted with or planning to have implantation of deep brain stimulator

         13. Pregnancy or lactation

         14. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the
             investigator would exclude the subject from the study

         15. Evidence of significant active hepatic disease. Stable elevations of liver enzymes,
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) due to
             concomitant medication(s) will be allowed if they are less than 3 times the upper
             limit of normal (ULN)

         16. An active CNS infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurologic disease, or
             any CNS disease deemed to be progressive during the course of the study that may
             confound the interpretation of the study results

         17. Any clinically significant psychiatric illness, psychological, or behavioral problems
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability
             to participate in the study

         18. Presence of psychotic disorders and/or unstable recurrent affective disorders evident
             by use of antipsychotics; presence or recent history (within 6 months) of major

             evidence of a vigabatrin associated clinically significant abnormality in a visual
             perimetry test. Subjects with a prior history of treatment with ezogabine should have
             no evidence of retinal abnormalities with funduscopic features similar to those seen
             in retinal pigment dystrophies.

         22. History of status epilepticus within 3 months of Visit 1

         23. Screening laboratory investigation demonstrates abnormal renal function
