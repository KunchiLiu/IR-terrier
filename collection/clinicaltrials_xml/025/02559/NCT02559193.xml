      The Study is a single-arm prospective trial of patients receiving at least one medication
      with a known association between genetics and drug metabolism. All patients will undergo
      genetic testing as determined by their treating physician. The specific genes tested will,
      in general, be based upon the drugs the patients are taking or those that the patient's
      treating physician is considering as potential substitutes for current medications.

      In this data collection only trial design, the PGx test is not a protocol-specified
      procedure. Rather, patients are eligible if they have undergone PGx testing within the last
      90 days. Thus, PGx testing will not be performed solely for inclusion in this clinical
      research initiative.

        The Study will include male or female patients 18 years of or older who are receiving at
        least one medication with metabolism known to depend on genetic variation and have the PGx
        test already performed. The patient must also meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria
        established by the protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient underwent PGx testing for alleles appropriate to the target drugs within the
             prior 90 days (&quot;index PGx test&quot;);

          2. Male or female patients 18 years or older who have given their written Informed
             Consent to participate in a Clinical Study based on voluntary agreement a through
             explanation of the patient's participation is provided to them. Patients must have
             adequate reading and writing abilities such that they can comprehend and answer the
             questions on the patient- completed assessments and Informed Consent Form;

          3. Patient was receiving at least one medication known to be associated with allelic
             variation at the time of the index PGx test), including over-the-counter medications;

        5. Patient has a history of at least one TDAE over the 12-month period preceding receipt
        of PGx test results, or has experienced inadequate efficacy from a target drug and
        receiving medical coverage through a private insurance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is currently hospitalized;

          2. Patient's medical and medication history is unavailable over the 90-day period
             preceding the receipt of PGx testing;

          3. Patient is unable to provide an accurate history due to mental incapacity;

          4. Patient is known to have undergone prior PGx testing for genes specific to the target
             drug(s), exclusive of the PGx test relating to this Study.
