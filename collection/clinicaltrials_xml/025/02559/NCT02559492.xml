    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1b, platform study in subjects with advanced or metastatic
      solid tumors. The study will be divided into 2 parts (Part 1a and Part 1b). Part 1a will
      evaluate a JAK inhibitor with JAK1 selectivity (INCB039110) in combination with an IDO1
      inhibitor (epacadostat; INCB024360; Group A) and INCB039110 in combination with a PI3K-delta
      inhibitor (INCB050465; Group B) to determine the MTD or PAD and the recommended Part 1b
      doses for each combination. Once the recommended dose has been identified for each treatment
      group in Part 1a, subjects with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled into expansion
      cohorts based upon prior treatment history with a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b).
