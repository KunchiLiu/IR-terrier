      The proposed study will add to the growing understanding of platelet activity and platelet
      inhibition in subjects with HIV. It will examine the relationship between platelet activity
      and its inhibition by antiplatelet therapy (aspirin monotherapy and clopidogrel monotherapy)
      in this high-risk cohort. Furthermore, it will provide important data on the mechanism of
      platelet activity and its inhibition using biomarkers of platelet activity, inflammation,
      immune activity and endothelial function and genetic expression profiling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is substantial evidence that the risk of serious non-AIDS conditions, such as
      cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, and non-AIDS-defining malignancies,
      is increased in persons with HIV infection as compared to the general population.
      HIV-induced activation of inflammatory and coagulation pathways have been implicated in this
      increased risk. However, causative mechanisms linking HIV, inflammation, and increased risk
      of non-AIDS diseases are poorly described. The investigators are interested in studying the
      link between HIV induced inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Inflammation mediates many
      aspects of disease pathogenesis in atherosclerosis, involving diverse cell types and
      mediating signals. Specifically, platelets have been implicated in atherosclerosis because
      of their pro-inflammatory and thrombogenic effects. Moreover, clinical studies have
      demonstrated the importance of platelet activity in coronary artery atherosclerosis and
      thrombosis. Whereas there is a great understanding of the pathogenesis of cardiac disease,
      there is a wide knowledge gap in the understanding of mechanisms of cardiovascular disease
      in patients with HIV.

      A recent study by the investigators demonstrated that platelet activity is heightened in
      subjects with HIV. Following 1-week of low-dose aspirin, platelet activity was inhibited. A
      surprising finding of this study demonstrated that antiplatelet therapy with 1 week of
      aspirin (325mg dose x1 day followed by 81mg daily) improved immune activity in subjects with
      HIV. The current study is being performed to replicate those findings when compared with a
      control group. Moreover, it remains unknown if the finding was specific to aspirin or
      whether the results were attributed to the antiplatelet effect of the drug. Clopidogrel is
      another antiplatelet therapy that targets the P2Y12 receptor (a different mechanism than
      aspirin) that has been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular events in various clinical
      settings. The doses of aspirin and clopidogrel the investigators will be employing have been
      tested in hundreds of studies with well-known benefits and risks. The investigators believe
      that understanding the mechanistic role of platelet inhibitors in the setting of HIV will
      help uncover a new strategic pathway of HIV pathogenesis. Also, subjects with HIV are at
      increased risk for cardiovascular events and understanding the platelet inhibition of
      aspirin and clopidogrel will help establish better designs for future trials aimed at
      preventing these events in HIV infected persons.

      The investigators have demonstrated that platelet activation is increased in HIV infection
      and can be attenuated by low-dose aspirin in a non-randomized study without a control group.
      Therefore, the Specific Aims of the study to be established are as follows:

        -  The effect of aspirin versus control on markers of platelet activity, inflammation,
           immune activity, and endothelial function.

        -  The effect of Clopidogrel versus control on markers of platelet activity, inflammation,
           immune activity, and endothelial function.

    <description>The primary objective of these analyses will be to compare the effects of aspirin versus control and clopidogrel versus control for the outcome of platelet activity. Aspirin is expected to decrease arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation by 50% versus control. Clopidogrel is expected to decrease ADP-induced platelet aggregation by 50% versus control.</description>
