  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent improvements in the US economy, unemployment remains a significant concern,
      and estimates indicate that one-third of unemployed persons drink at hazardous levels,
      adversely impacting their health and abilities to find jobs. Reinforcement interventions are
      highly efficacious in reducing substance use, and they can be applied to increase
      job-seeking activities as well. In partnership with CT United Labor Agency, this project is
      designed to reduce hazardous drinking and enhance active participation in job-seeking
      activities among those with job loss. It will evaluate the independent and combined effects
      of reinforcing negative breathalyzer samples and job-seeking activities to ascertain the
      simplest and most cost-effective approach to improving outcomes in this population.
      Unemployed individuals with hazardous drinking (N = 280) will be randomly assigned to one of
      four conditions using a 2 x 2 design: standard care, standard care with reinforcement for
      submitting negative breathalyzer samples, standard care with reinforcement for job-seeking
      activities, or standard care plus reinforcement for both negative breathalyzer samples and
      job-seeking activities. Participants in all conditions will receive usual services part of
      CT United Labor Agency, along with a novel remote breath alcohol monitoring procedure. The
      study interventions will be in effect for three months, and participants will be followed
      for one year. Alcohol and other drug use, employment, psychiatric symptoms, and global
      measures of health will be assessed throughout treatment and follow-up. Reinforcing negative
      breathalyzer samples is expected to significantly reduce drinking, and reinforcing
      job-seeking activities is expected to increase re-employment rates and reduce time until job
      attainment. Reinforcing both negative breathalyzer samples and job-seeking activities is
      hypothesized to improve outcomes along both domains. The reinforcement interventions may
      also decrease psychiatric distress and slow progression of physical decline, common among
      the unemployed. If efficacious and cost-effective, results from this study may stimulate
      adoption of reinforcement interventions in the context of unemployment services. Reducing
      the adverse consequences of hazardous drinking and improving job re-entry may have
      pronounced benefits in a highly vulnerable segment of the US population.
