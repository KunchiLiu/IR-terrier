    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis: Subjects must have a diagnosis of high-risk (defined in protocol)
             neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma (nodular or intermixed) verified by histology
             or demonstration of clumps of tumor cells in bone marrow with elevated urinary
             catecholamine metabolites.

          -  Subjects must be age ≤ 21 years at initial diagnosis

          -  Subjects must not have had prior systemic therapy except for localized emergency
             radiation to sites of life-threatening or function-threatening disease and/or no more
             than 1 cycle of chemotherapy per a low or intermediate risk neuroblastoma regimen (as
             per P9641, A3961, ANBL0531, or similar) prior to determination of MYCN amplification
             status and histology.

          -  Specimens will be obtained only in a non-significant risk manner and not solely for
             the purpose of investigational testing.

          -  Adequate liver function must be demonstrated (defined in protocol)

          -  Subjects must have adequate renal function defined as a Serum creatinine based on
             age/gender (defined in protocol)

          -  Adequate Cardiac Function (defined in protocol)

          -  Ability to tolerate PBSC collection: No known contraindication to PBSC collection.

          -  A negative serum pregnancy test is required for female participants of child bearing
             potential (≥13 years of age or after onset of menses)

          -  Both male and female post-pubertal study subjects need to agree to use one of the
             more effective birth control methods during treatment and for six months after
             treatment is stopped. These methods include total abstinence (no sex), oral
             contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;), an intrauterine device (IUD), levonorgestrol implants
             (Norplant), or medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-provera shots). If one of
             these cannot be used, contraceptive foam with a condom is recommended.

          -  Informed Consent: All subjects and/or legal guardians must sign informed written
             consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional
             guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are 12-18 months of age with INSS Stage 4 and all stage 3 subjects with
             favorable biologic features (ie, nonamplified MYCN, favorable pathology, and DNA
             index &gt; 1) are not eligible.

          -  Lactating females are not eligible unless they have agreed not to breastfeed their
             infants.

          -  Subjects receiving any investigational drug concurrently.

          -  Subjects with any other medical condition, including but not limited to malabsorption
             syndromes, mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely
             to interfere with the interpretation of the results or which would interfere with a
             subject's ability to sign or the legal guardian's ability to sign the informed
             consent, and subject's ability to cooperate and participate in the study
