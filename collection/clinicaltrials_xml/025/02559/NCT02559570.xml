    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of linaclotide for the
      treatment of functional constipation (FC), in children age 6-17 years This study includes up
      to a 4-week Screening Period, and a 2 to 3-week Pretreatment Period. Patients age 6-11 will
      receive oral liquid formulation and patients 12-17 will receive solid oral capsule or liquid
      oral solution.

      Children ages 6-11 years meeting the entry criteria will be randomized to 1 of 3 doses of
      linaclotide or placebo for 4 weeks. Children ages 12-17 years meeting the entry criteria
      will be randomized to 1 of 4 doses of linaclotide or placebo for 4 weeks.

      This 4-week study will assess the effects of linaclotide on bowel movement frequency, as
      well as other bowel symptoms of FC.
