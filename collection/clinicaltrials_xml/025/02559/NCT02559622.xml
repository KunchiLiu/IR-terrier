  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of treatment with 300 mg or with 150 mg
      secukinumab (administered weekly for 4 weeks followed by four-weekly administration) on
      endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness after 12 weeks and for up to 52 weeks in
      subjects with chronic plaque-type psoriasis. Furthermore soluble biomarkers will be assessed
      to evaluate the influence of secukinumab on cardiovascular risk. Magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) will be performed in a subpopulation to assess the treatment effect on arterial vessel
      wall morphometry in atherosclerosis prone vascular beds.

    <measure>Flow Mediated Dilation</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Brachial artery diameter is measured at rest (1 minute), during inflation of the distal cuff to 100 mmHg for 4.5 min and for 4.5 minutes following deflation. FMD is measured as the % maximal increase in diameter following deflation of the cuff.
This is an exploratory, hypothesis-generating study; therefore all endpoints are of non-confirmatory nature. Whether or not Secukinumab has a substantial impact on the cardiovascular system therefore cannot be determined by the primary endpoint alone, but instead will be explored by assessing the complete set of cardiovascular endpoints. No predefined statistical hypothesis will be tested. The justification for this is the difficulty in estimating the effect size due to lack of adequate precedent. For regulatory reasons only, primary and secondary endpoints are identified.</description>

    <description>Brachial artery diameter is measured by doppler ultrasound at rest (1 minute), during inflation of a distal cuff to 100 mmHg for 4.5 min and for 4.5 minutes following deflation. FMD is measured as the % maximal increase in diameter following deflation of the cuff.</description>

    <measure>Pulse Wave Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>at weeks 4, 12, 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse wave analysis is performed on the central aortic pressure waveform as derived by SphygmoCor XCEL from the brachial pressure waveform recorded in a partially-inflated blood pressure cuff around the upper arm.
Parameters determined in pulse wave analysis include central aortic blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse pressure), augmentation pressure (AP - the added pressure during systole due to wave reflection), and augmentation index (AIx - the percentage of the central pulse pressure due to wave reflection).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulse Wave Velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 52</time_frame>
    <description>Regional arterial pulse wave velocity is directly related to arterial stiffness and is defined as the time it takes for the blood pressure wave to travel from a proximal site to a distal site (relative to the heart) divided by the distance (PWV = ∆distance/∆time [m/s]). To this end, the foot of the arterial pulse wave is being recorded by using the SphygmoCor XCEL device. XCEL simultaneously measures the pressure waveform at the femoral site (using a partially inflated custom blood pressure cuff) and the carotid site (using hand-held applanation tonometry). The foot-to-foot time between the two pressure waveforms is the time interval used in the PWV calculation.</description>

    <measure>total plaque burden in the carotid artery and aorta as well as plaque composition in the carotid artery</measure>
    <time_frame>at weeks 12 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>2D axial dark blood T1, T2, proton density weighted spin echo based images and time of flight images will be acquired from the bilateral carotid arteries as well as the descending aorta. Measures of plaque burden such as wall area, total vessel area, wall thickness and a normalized wall index (NWI) will then be computed. Additionally, and only in the carotids, plaque composition will be evaluated if a subject is found to have a complex atherosclerotic lesion.</description>

    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 52 and for patients entering the extension phase at weeks 60, 68, 76, 84, 92, 100, and 104.</time_frame>
    <description>The head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs are assessed separately for erythema, thickening (plaque elevation, induration), and scaling (desquamation). The average degree of severity of each sign in each of the four body regions is assigned a score of 0-4. The area covered by lesions on each body region is estimated as a percentage of the total area of that particular body region. Further practical details help the assessment:
The PASI score is calculated using the formula:
PASI = 0.1(EH+IH+DH)AH + 0.2(EU+IU+DU)AU + 0.3(ET+IT+DT)AT + 0.4(EL+IL+DL)AL
PASI scores can range from a lower value of 0, corresponding to no signs of psoriasis, up to a theoretic maximum of 72.0. The following definition is used in this study: PASI 50 (75, 90, 100): subjects achieving ≥ 50% (75%, 90%, 100%) improvement (reduction) in PASI score compared to baseline (visit 2) are defined having achieved PASI 50 (75, 90, 100).</description>

    <description>IGA mod 2011 will be conducted for overall psoriatic disease 0: Clear. No signs of psoriasis. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may be present.
Almost clear. Normal to pink coloration of lesions; no thickening; no to minimal focal scaling.
Mild. Pink to light red coloration; just detectable to mild thickening; predominantly fine scaling.
Moderate. Dull bright red, clearly distinguishable erythema; clearly distinguishable to moderate thickening; moderate scaling.
Severe: Bright to deep dark red coloration; severe thickening with hard edges; severe / coarse scaling covering almost all or all lesions.
Based on this scale, a subject will be considered as an IGA 0 or 1 responder if they achieve a score of 0 or 1, respectively and improve by at least 2 points on the IGA scale at a given time point compared to their score at randomization (baseline).</description>
