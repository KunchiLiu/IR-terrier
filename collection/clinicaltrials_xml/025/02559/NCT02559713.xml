    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the concentration of vedolizumab in breast milk of
      lactating women with active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who are
      receiving vedolizumab therapeutically.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. This post-marketing milk-only
      lactation study will assess concentrations of vedolizumab in breast milk of lactating women
      with active UC or CD who are receiving vedolizumab therapeutically.

      The study will enroll approximately 12 participants. All participants who received an
      established vedolizumab maintenance regimen (at least two 300 mg doses of vedolizumab once
      every 8 weeks prior to delivery of infant and one 300 mg dose of vedolizumab postpartum)
      will receive their scheduled dose of vedolizumab on day 1 of the study at the clinic, study
      site or other healthcare provider (HCP) office:

      30-minute IV infusion of 300 mg vedolizumab. This multi-center trial will be conducted in
      the United States. The overall time to participate in this study is 3 months. Participants
      will make visits to clinic, study site or HCP office at Screening, Check-in (Day -1). Visits
      on Days 4, 8, 15, or 29. may be completed at the participant's home setting in the presence
      of a qualified nurse, or at a clinic, study site or other HCP office. The study
      exit/follow-up safety assessment will occur on Day 57(Â±3).
