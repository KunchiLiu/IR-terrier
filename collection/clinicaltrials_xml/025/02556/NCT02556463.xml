    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, unblinded study to evaluate the TLR 7/8 agonist MEDI9197 delivered by
      IT injection to subjects with solid tumors or CTCL, and in combination with durvalumab and
      palliative radiation in subjects with solid tumors. The study uses a 3 + 3 dose escalation
      design to evaluate a range of doses.
