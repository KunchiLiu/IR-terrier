      Background:

      HIV attacks the immune system. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a combination of drugs used
      for treating HIV infection. For some people, ART drugs stop working against their HIV.
      Researchers want to see if a different form of the drug tenofovir (an ART drug currently
      approved by the FDA), combined with another drug, may help people whose HIV is resistant to
      ART. This combination pill is called F/TAF

      Objective:

      To study the safety and efficacy of the drug F/TAF, when used with other ART, for people
      whose HIV infection has been hard to control with available medicines.

      Eligibility:

      People age 14 years and older who have HIV infection and are enrolled in the DOTCOM
      (14-I-0009) protocol.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with physical exam, medical history, and blood and urine
      tests.

      Participants will stay in the hospital for at least 10 days. For the first 9 days, they will
      take F/TAF by mouth along with their usual ART drugs.

      In the hospital, they will repeat the screening tests.

      Participants will have a DEXA scan, an x-ray that measures calcium and other minerals in the
      bones. Participants will lie on a soft table while the scanner passes over the lower spine
      and hips.

      Participants will get a supply of F/TAF and some new ART drugs to take at home.

      Participants will have follow-up visits in 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. After the 12-week
      visit, they will come back about every 3 months for about 1 year.

      At these visits, participants will repeat the screening tests. They will discuss any
      problems taking their ART drugs. They may have another DEXA scan.

      Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), a subset of HIV-1-infected patients
      have uncontrolled viremia, multiple drug class resistance, and limited treatment options.
      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) forms part of most ART regimens, however its long-term
      use is associated with renal tubulopathy and reduced bone mineral density. Viral mutations
      (eg, K65R, multiple thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) can confer resistance or reduced
      susceptibility to TDF.

      Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an investigational oral prodrug of tenofovir. When compared
      to TDF, TAF demonstrated lower plasma tenofovir concentrations and more potent antiviral
      activity at approximately one-tenth of the dose. TAF has the advantage of reduced tenofovir
      exposure to the renal tubules and bone, potentially resulting in fewer kidney and bone
      effects. As with TDF, TAF has potent activities against hepatitis B virus (HBV), and may be
      a treatment option for patients with HIV/HBV co-infections. Phase 2 trials have demonstrated
      the non-inferiority of TAF to TDF in treating HIV-1 infection in ART-naive patients. Smaller
      reductions in bone mineral density were measured with TAF than TDF. The most common adverse
      events were nausea and diarrhea.

      This single-arm, single-site, open-label trial will explore the safety and efficacy of TAF
      in a fixed combination with emtricitabine (FTC) (F/TAF, Gilead Sciences Inc.) as part of a
      salvage antiretroviral regimen for HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents (greater than or
      equal to 14 years) who experienced virologic failure. The study will recruit patients who
      have failed TDF-containing regimens or cannot take TDF (due to resistance mutations or risk
      of renal injury) and for whom abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) is not an optimal alternative.
      Eligible patients will begin 9 days of inpatient directly observed therapy (DOT) with F/TAF
      plus their pre-enrollment background regimen. On Day 10, patients will switch to F/TAF plus
      OBT while waiting for the results of Day 10 HIV RNA results. Patients with an HIV RNA
      decline of &lt;0.5 log10 from Day 1 to Day 10 will discontinue F/TAF, end their study
      participation, and continue OBT (with TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC in place of F/TAF, as appropriate)
      under the 14-I-0009 protocol. Patients with a greater than or equal to 0.5 log10 decline in
      HIV RNA will continue on F/TAF + OBT for 48 weeks, with periodic outpatient assessments of
      adherence, safety, renal function, bone mineral density, HIV RNA, and CD4 T cell counts.
      Switching of one or more drugs in an ART regimen due to inadequate viral response will
      require inpatient DOT under 14-I-0009.
