  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RST-001 is a gene therapy given as an injection into the eye and delivers a gene encoding a
      photo switch, channelrhodopsin-2, (optogenetics) to cells in the retina of the eye. When
      expressed, the channelrhodopsin-2 protein can depolarize in response to light thus
      generating a signal that is transmitted to the brain.

      The study is composed of two parts. An initial dose-ranging study (part 1) is proposed
      whereby three dose levels of RST-001 will be studied in three separate groups of adult
      patients with advanced disease. This first part of the study is aimed at determining a
      single dose of the experimental agent which is safe and well tolerated, to further evaluate
      in a fourth group of patients. The second part of the study is aimed at obtaining additional
      safety data at the highest tolerated dose and providing important additional clinical data
      to guide the design of future efficacy studies.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

        Participants must meet all of the following criteria.

          1. Age &gt;= 18 years

          2. Signed and dated written informed consent obtained from the patient.

          3. Ability to comply with testing and all protocol tests.

          4. Diagnosis of advanced retinitis pigmentosa (RP) defined as:

               1. Clinical diagnosis of advanced RP

               2. Prior documented retinal electrophysiological evidence of rod-cone photoreceptor
                  degeneration

               3. Baseline evidence of &lt;10microvolts maximal b-wave ERG response

          5. Visual acuity in the study eye of no-better-than hand motion

          6. Visual acuity in the non-study eye of no-better-than finger counting

          7. Presence of retinal ganglion cells and/or retinal nerve fiber layer on SD-OCT testing

          8. The presence of macular edema due to RP will not be considered an exclusion criteria

          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and
             at baseline, and agree to use an effective form of contraception, or be surgically
             sterile or postmenopausal (defined as last menstrual period greater than two years
             prior to baseline. Acceptable methods of contraception include hormonal contraception
             (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal patch or vaginal ring),
             intrauterine device, barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or surgical
             sterilization (tubal ligation).

         10. Males must use two forms of contraception (including one barrier method for three
             months following agent administration if their partner is of child-bearing
             potential), or must be surgically sterile.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Any one of the following will exclude patients from being enrolled into the study:

          1. Unable or unwilling to meet requirements of the study;

          2. Participation in a clinical study (ocular or non-ocular) with an investigational
             drug, agent or therapy in the past six months;

          3. Concurrent participation in another interventional clinical ocular study;

          4. Prior participation in any gene or stem cell therapy (ocular or other);

          5. Pre-existing eye conditions that would preclude the planned treatment (i.e.
             injection) or interfere with the interpretation of study endpoints or surgical
             complications (example would include (but not limited to) glaucoma, diseases
             affecting the optic nerve causing significant visual field loss, active uveitis,
             corneal or lenticular opacities);

          6. Complicating systemic diseases or clinically significant abnormal baseline laboratory
             values. Complicating systemic diseases would include those in which the disease
             itself, or the treatment for the disease, can alter ocular function. Examples are
             malignancies whose treatment could affect central nervous system function (for
             example, radiation treatment of the orbit; leukemia with central nervous system/optic
             nerve involvement). Also excluded would be subjects with any immunological response
             dysfunction, for example, immuno-compromising diseases or use of immunosuppressive
             medications, among others. Subjects who are positive for hepatitis B, C, and HIV will
             be excluded.;

          7. Cataract surgery, intraocular and/or peri-ocular injection in the study eye within
             the prior six months;

          8. Prior vitrectomy or aphakia in the study eye;

          9. Known sensitivity to any component of the study agent or medications planned for use
             in the peri-operative period.

         10. Current pregnancy or breastfeeding;

         11. Individuals of childbearing potential who are pregnant or unwilling to use effective
             contraception for the duration of the study;

         12. Subjects will be excluded if immunological studies show presence of neutralizing
             antibodies to AAV2 above 1:1000;

         13. Use of anti-platelet agents that may alter coagulation within 28 days prior to study
             agent administration;

         14. Any other condition that would not allow the potential subject to complete follow-up
             examinations during the course of the study and, in the opinion of the investigator,
             makes the potential subject unsuitable for the study.
