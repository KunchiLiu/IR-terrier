          -  A structural abnormality in the esophagus or pharynx such as a stricture or
             diverticulum that could impede passage of the delivery catheter and/or an endoscope.

          -  Achalasia or any other severe motility disorder that may pose a safety risk during

          -  Patients who are unable or unwilling to take prescribed proton pump inhibitor
             medication for the duration of the device implant
