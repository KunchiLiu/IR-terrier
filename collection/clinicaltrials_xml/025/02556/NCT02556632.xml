    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies and compares prophylactic topical agents in
      reducing radiation-induced dermatitis in patients with non-inflammatory breast cancer or
      breast cancer in situ. The prophylactic topical agents, such as curcumin-based gel or HPR
      Plus, may reduce the severity of the radiation-induced dermatitis by minimizing water loss
      and inflammation during radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the effectiveness of Curcumin gel (curcumin-based gel) or HPR Plus™ in
      reducing radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the effectiveness of Curcumin gel or HPR Plus™ in reducing pain from
      radiation therapy (RT)-induced skin reactions.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of administering prophylactic topical treatments for
      radiation dermatitis to breast cancer patients receiving RT.

      II. Identify a blood biomarker that correlates with the severity of radiation dermatitis at
      the end of RT and a biomarker for response to topical treatment.

      III. Evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of using &quot;central blinded reviewers&quot; for rating
      radiation dermatitis severity on digital photographs.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients apply curcumin-based gel three times daily (TID) approximately every 4-6
      hours beginning on the first day of radiation therapy and continuing until 1 week after
      completion of radiation therapy.

      ARM II: Patients apply HPR Plus™ topically TID approximately every 4-6 hours beginning on
      the first day of radiation therapy and continuing until 1 week after completion of radiation
      therapy.

      ARM III: Patients apply placebo gel topically TID approximately every 4-6 hours beginning on
      the first day of radiation therapy and continuing until 1 week after completion of radiation
      therapy.

      After completion of radiation therapy, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the severity of skin reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 1 week after completion of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The mean post-RT RDS score (i.e., 1 week post-RT score) for each arm will be compared using ANOVA to determine if the topical interventions reduce the severity of skin reactions after completion of RT. The mean time to initiation of standard care between each arm will be compared using ANOVA to determine if the topical agents required addition of standard care to reduce radiation dermatitis severity. National Institutes of Health Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scores at the end of RT for each treatment arm will be analyzed and compared to the mean RDS score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of moist desquamation (i.e., associated with RDS 3.5 and 4.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 week after completion of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The degree to which each topical intervention decreases the incidence of moist desquamation will be examined using Fisher's exact test. Each agent's potential as a preventative intervention will be determined through comparison of the proportion of subjects with no to minimal radiation dermatitis within each arm using Fisher's exact test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean radiation dermatitis severity (RDS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 week after completion of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The mean RDS score at end-RT for each treatment arm will be estimated, the mean difference and 95% confidence intervals between the intervention and placebo arms will be reported, and the difference with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparisons testing will be tested using the Tukey-Kramer method for multiple comparisons.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pain measured by Self-Report Pain Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 2 weeks after completion of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change in baseline to End-RT pain at the treatment site for each arm will be compared using ANOVA. Differences between groups will be compared individually using the Tukey-Kramer method for multiple comparisons. The mean change from baseline to post-RT pain at the treatment site for each arm (using both weekly pain score for 1 week and 2 weeks post-RT) will be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pain severity measured by the Skin-Pain Inventory and Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 2 weeks after completion of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Will identify pain symptoms associated with radiation-induced skin reactions. The mean change in baseline to end-RT pain and symptoms at the treatment site for each arm will be compared using ANOVA. Tukey-Kramer method will be used for multiple comparisons. The mean change in baseline to post-RT pain at the treatment site for each arm will be evaluated (using both weekly pain score for 1 week and 2 weeks post-RT).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability &amp; feasibility as measured by Feedback Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Week post-RT</time_frame>
    <description>All data from 12 questions will be used in determining which topical intervention is the most acceptable and feasible product to use for radiation dermatitis in breast cancer subjects. The percentage of responses for each response on 10 of the questions on the Feedback Questionnaire will provide insight into the acceptability of each of the topical agents.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in symptoms as measured by Symptom Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 2 weeks after completion of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Will determine which of the topical interventions provide the most benefit to the subject with the least number of side effects and toxicities. The mean change in symptom severity from baseline to 1 week post-RT at for each arm will be compared using ANOVA. Tukey-Kramer method will be used for multiple comparisons. The mean change in symptom severity from baseline to Post-RT pain at the treatment site for each arm (using both weekly pain score for 1 week and 2 weeks Post-RT). Enrollment and retention rates will also be used to assess feasibility.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance as measured by Compliance Log and Topical Application Diary (subject-reported)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 1 week after completion of radiation therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The number of missed applications will be assessed using the Topical Application Log based on the total number of applications the subject should use for their prescribed RT course. The Compliance Log weights will used to ensure subjects were using appropriate amount of topical agent. A compliance percentage will be calculated by dividing the number of actual applications (reported applications) by the required applications in a week.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Rating of digital photographs of skin reaction by blinded reviewers.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 week post-RT</time_frame>
    <description>Digital photographs of the radiation-induced skin reaction (end-RT and 1 week post-RT) will be rated, using RDS score, by 2 Dermatologists and 2 Radiation Oncologists. Inter-rater reliability will be examined between the four blinded reviewers, as well as with the in-person ratings, to determine the joint-probability (i.e., proportion) of agreement among the ratings.</description>
