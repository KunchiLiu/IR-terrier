    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to acquire safety data (including assessment of anti-rHuPH20
      antibodies), regarding the course and outcome of pregnancy in women ever treated with
      HYQVIA. Development of the fetus/infant at birth and for the first 2 years will also be
      followed.

      Blood samples (plasma) for antibodies against recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) that
      remain after study testing is done may be stored and used for additional testing (eg,
      further evaluation of an abnormal test or an adverse event). Samples will be stored in a
      coded form for a maximum of 2 years after the final study report has been completed and,
      subsequently, will be destroyed.
