      This study seeks to examine a Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) using the 360° Video
      Virtual Reality (VR) technology for the fear of heights and fear of spiders.

      An estimated 10-11% of the US population experiences a specific phobia at some point in
      their lives (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Magee et al., 1996). About 60-85% of
      those individuals with a specific phobia never seek treatment (Agras, Sylvester, &amp; Oliveau,
      1969; Boyd et al., 1990; Magee et al., 1996). Clinical psychologist can help improve the
      number of phobia sufferers to seek treatment. Advances in technology are helping clinicians
      create novel treatment strategies for different anxiety disorders. Virtual reality exposure
      therapy (VRET) may help these individuals confront their fears and treat their phobia.

      While virtual reality exposure therapy has shown promise in research (Powers &amp; Emmelkamp,
      2008), studies have shown that many users complain that the computer generated virtual
      reality (VR) stimuli looks unrealistic, eccentric and too much like a video game (Kwon,
      Powell, &amp; Chalmers, 2013). Virtual reality environments have been traditionally created by
      programmers using video game assets and computer generated imagery (CGI). While CGI can be
      used to make intricate virtual environments, unless there is a team of expert digital
      artists, the virtual stimulus may end up looking rudimentary and exhibit a number of
      graphical glitches which could prove distracting in therapy. Furthermore CGI often suffers
      from the uncanny valley effect: the tendency of CGI representations of people to be viewed
      as unsettling as the representations become more lifelike. In addition the many current CGI
      virtual reality packages are expensive and only available for limited number of fear
      domains. Recently however an exciting alternative to traditional computer generated virtual
      reality has emerged: 360° Video VR. 360° Video VR is a radical filmmaking technology that
      can turn live action footage into a 360° environment that users can interact with. 360°
      Video VR is made by filming with an array of multiple HD cameras carefully arranged to
      capture all angles in a 360° area of a live action event. Then those angles are stitched
      together in post-production into a 360° texture sphere and the sphere is then mapped to the
      head tracker on the users HDM. Leading to the effect that when a user turns his head, their
      view of the live action video footage turns with them in real time (e.g. if the user looks
      down, the camera pans down and the user sees the floor) allowing the user to look around
      anywhere in the 360° of filmed footage of the live action event. The benefit of 360° video
      VR as opposed CGI VR is that it is photo realistic, does not suffer from a uncanny valley
      effect of CGI, and is able to capture nuances of real life fears that are hard to reproduce
      with CGI.
