      NBI has been proven to be a useful tool to detect early NPC, but they were few studies
      concerning the detection of post-radiotherapy mucosal residual NPC using NBI system

      Background

      NPC has a uniquely high prevalence in Southern China. According to the Hong Kong Cancer
      Registry in 2012, NPC was the sixth commonest cancer in men and thirteenth in women. It
      accounted for 2.9% of all new cancer cases. In 2012, there were 819 new cases of NPC.

      NPC is highly radiosensitive. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the mainstay of treatment.
      Despite the chemo-irradiation, disease control failure still occurred in NPC patients
      presenting as persistent tumor. Early detection of those post-radiotherapy residual NPC is
      essential for early arrangement of salvage therapy. Detection methods include imaging,
      plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA, endoscopy examinations and nasopharynx biopsy.

      NBI system has been well proven as a tool to detect early digestive tract cancer and head
      and neck cancer. However, there were only few studies targeting the detection of
      post-radiotherapy mucosal residual of NPC using NBI system

      Objective

        1. To identify the vessel pattern of those confirmed NPC case using NBI system

        2. To identify the endoscopy features of post-radiotherapy mucosal residual nasopharyngeal
           carcinoma using NBI system

        3. To establish the positive predicted value, negative predicted value, sensitivity and
           specificity of using both normal white light (WL) endoscopy and NBI system for
           detecting mucosal residual NPC

      Method:

        1. All newly biopsy confirmed NPC patient will be assessed, their nasopharynx endoscopic
           image will be captured using both WL + NBI system

        2. At post-radiotherapy 8th weeks, endoscopic examination will be arranged for patient
           using both WL + NBI system, biopsy will also be taken to detect mucosal residual NPC

    <description>All post-radiotherapy 8 weeks NPC patient will routinely undergo laryngoscope examination (WL system) and NP biopsy will be taken at the same time to determine if there is any residual NPC. In this study, laryngoscope with NBI system will be used. NBI system will be turn on during the post radiotherapy 8 week laryngoscope examination in additional to routine WL system</description>
