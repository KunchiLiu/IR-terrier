  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate that low risk Pulmonary Embolism (PE) participants
      who are discharged from the Emergency Department (ED) to the home environment and treated
      with rivaroxaban as outpatients have fewer total days in the hospital for bleeding and/or
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) events through Day 30 compared to participants who are treated
      with initial hospitalization and standard-of-care.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know
      the identity of the intervention), parallel-group, multicenter (study conducted at multiple
      sites) study to evaluate that low risk PE participants who are discharged from the ED and
      treated with rivaroxaban compared to participants who are treated with initial
      hospitalization and standard-of-care. The study consists of a Screening and Randomization
      Period, followed by a 90-day open-label treatment period, and an end of study/early
      withdrawal (EOS) visit. The duration of study participation for each participant is
      approximately 3 months. The participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two
      treatments. Safety will be monitored during the study.

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcome: Treatment Satisfaction Score by Anti-cloting Treatment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 14, 30, and 90</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction will be assessed using Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS). The ACTS is comprised of 2 subscales: Burdens and Benefits. The treatment experience scores range from 'Not at all' to 'Extremely' on a five-point Likert scale; higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with treatment.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcome: Satisfaction to Site-of-Care Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction to Site-of-Care (hospitalization versus home care) rates the participants level of satisfaction to care and location with care received as well as preference to location of care provided. Participants rate the 3 items of this scale of 1=Very satisfied; 2=Quite satisfied; 3=Neither; 4=Quite dissatisfied; and 5=Very dissatisfied for satisfaction questions and for the one preference question responses include 1=In the hospital; 2=In the community; and 3=No preference.</description>
