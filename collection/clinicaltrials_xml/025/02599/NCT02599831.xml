    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether electrical pudendal nerve stimulation is
      more effective than pelvic floor muscle training plus transanal electrical stimulation in
      treating post prostatectomy Incontinence.

      Conservative therapy could be considered a choice of treatment for stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI) as it seems to have no side effect and causes significant and long-term
      improvement in symptoms. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and electrical stimulation are
      two commonly used forms of conservative treatment for SUI. PFMT improves the structural
      support of the pelvis. However, many patients have difficulty identifying and isolating
      their pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and are unable to perform the exercise effectively.
      Furthermore, patients who can identify the PFM often find that the required daily exercise
      routine is burdensome. Hence, the primary disadvantage of PFMT is lack of long-term patient
      compliance. Electrical stimulation (ES) is a non-invasive, passive treatment that produces a
      muscle contraction. Transanal electrical stimulation (TES) has little side-effect, and the
      patient compliance is 70-85% in published reports. TES results in PFM contraction by
      indirect nerve stimulation, mainly by polysynaptic reflex responses. The indirect
      stimulation and reflexive contraction may be the reason why the effect of electrical
      stimulation is not as good as that of PFMT when performed correctly. By combining the
      advantages of PFMT and TES and incorporating the technique of deep insertion of long
      acupuncture needles, we developed electrical pudendal nerve stimulation (EPNS). In EPNS,
      long acupuncture needles of 0.40 Х 100 or 125 mm were deeply inserted into four sacral
      points and electrified to stimulate the pudendal nerves (PN) and contract the PFM. CT
      transverse plane at the coccygeal apex has showed that the position of the lower needle tip
      is similar to where (adjacent to PN at Alcock's canal) the Bion device is implanted for
      chronic PN stimulation. Our previous study showed that EPNS had a better therapeutic effect
      on female SUI as compared with PFMT + TES. Simultaneous records of perineal ultrasonographic
      PFM contraction, vaginal pressure and pelvic floor surface electromyogram in our previous
      study have proved that EPNS can exactly excite PN and induce PFM contraction in female SUI
      patients. However, EPNS has also shown satisfactory effect in male patients with SUI
      problems. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of EPNS to PFMT + TES in
      treating male SUI.

    <description>Four sacral points are selected. The two upper points are located about 1 cm bilateral to the sacrococcygeal joint. Needles of 0.40 Х 100 mm are inserted perpendicularly to the upper points to a depth of 80 to 90 mm to produce a sensation referred to the urethra or the anus. The two lower points are about 1 cm bilateral to the tip of the coccyx. Needles of 0.40 Х 100 or 125 mm are inserted obliquely to the lower points towards the ischiorectal fossa to a depth of 90 to 110 mm to produce a sensation referred to the urethra.
After the sensation referred to the above regions is produced, each of two pairs of electrodes from a G6805-2 Multi-Purpose Health Device is connected with the two ipsilaterally needles.</description>

    <description>PFM training: EMG (electromyography)-biofeedback assisted PFMT was performed by specially trained therapists using AM1000B (Shenzhen Creative Industry Co.Ltd, China), 20 min three times a week for a total of four weeks. Patients conduct 30 maximal high intensity PFM contractions for 2-6 sec (with 2-6 sec rest), three sessions a day at home for a total of four weeks. Transanal ES: Using PHENIX USB 4 at a current intensity of &lt; 60 mA (as high as possible to get a contraction) and frequencies of 15 Hz and 85 Hz (alternate 3 min periods of stimulation); 20 min three times a week for a total of four weeks.</description>
