    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study in Japan. Eleven sites which have already participated in the
      investigator-initiated clinical study (Early Access Program) will participate in this
      study.The objective of this study is to gain further information on the safety and efficacy
      of treatment with asfotase alfa.

    <measure>The safety of asfotase alfa will be assessed by routine monitoring of patients about Adverse Events (AEs) including Injection Site Reactions (ISRs) and Injection Associated Reactions (IARs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The severity (mild, moderate or severe)of each AE will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.03.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient or parent (or legal guardian) must provide written informed consent prior to
             the performance of any study-related procedures and must be willing to comply with
             study procedures. Where appropriate and required by local regulations, patient assent
             for participation must also be obtained.

          2. Patient has completed the investigator-initiated clinical study (HPPJEAP-01) protocol
             for asfotase alfa

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a documented form of rickets caused by a condition other than HPP,
             including, but not limited to, rickets caused by 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency

          2. Patient has serum calcium and/or phosphorus levels below the normal range

          3. Patient is pregnant or lactating

          4. Patient received treatment with bisphosphonates within 2 years prior to the Screening
             visit

          5. Patient has a documented sensitivity to any of the components of asfotase alfa

          6. Patient is currently enrolled in any other program or clinical study involving an
             investigational new drug, device, or treatment for HPP (eg, bone marrow
             transplantation)

          7. Patient has clinically significant other disease in the opinion of the Investigator,
             defined as any other non HPP-related condition for which the patient is considered
             medically unstable.
