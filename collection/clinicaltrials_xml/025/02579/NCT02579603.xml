  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, twelve week, open label, randomized, parallel group study to assess
      safety and tolerability of combined treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone.

      A secondary objective is to assess the exposure based on PK trough concentration values to
      nintedanib either given alone or in combination with pirfenidone and to assess the exposure
      of pirfenidone when combined with nintedanib.
