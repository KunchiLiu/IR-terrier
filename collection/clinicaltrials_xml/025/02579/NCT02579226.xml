  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I study is primarily designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD2811
      at increasing doses in patients with advanced solid tumours and for whom no standard of care
      exists. The study will be conducted in two parts, a dose-escalation phase (Part A) and a
      dose expansion phase (Part B). During Part A, the dose-escalation phase, patient enrolment
      will proceed according to a 3+3 design where the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be identified. The study will also characterize the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AZD2811 and will explore the potential biological activity
      by assessing anti-tumour activity in patients. Once the MTD is established, Part B (the dose
      expansion phase) will commence and will enroll patients in 3 groups. Part B will further
      explore PK parameters, safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour activity of the
      AZD2811 RP2D as monotherapy (Group 1) in patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC, and when
      combined with irinotecan (Group 2 and Group 3).

      In Part B-Group 2, PK, the safety and tolerability of the AZD2811 will be assessed in a
      lead-in cohort when given in combination with irinotecan. When a safe and tolerated dose for
      the AZD2811 and irinotecan combination has been defined, an additional 30 patients will be
      enrolled to assess efficacy (Part B-Group 3).

      This is a FTIP study primarily designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD2811
      at increasing doses in patients with advanced solid tumours and for whom no standard of care
      exists. The study will be conducted in two parts, a dose-escalation phase (Part A) in
      patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours, and a dose-expansion phase (Part B) in
      patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC. During Part A, the dose-escalation phase, patient
      enrolment will proceed according to a 3+3 design where the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be identified. The study will also characterize the PK
      profile of AZD2811 and explore potential biological activity by assessing anti-tumour
      activity in patients. Once the MTD is established, Part B, the dose-expansion phase, will
      enroll patients in 3 groups. Part B will further explore PK parameters, safety,
      tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour activity of the AZD2811 RP2D as monotherapy (Group
      1) in patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC, and when combined with irinotecan (Group 2 and
      Group 3).

      In Group 2, PK, safety and tolerability of the AZD2811 and irinotecan combination in a brief
      lead-in cohort will be assessed. Once a safe and tolerated dose for the AZD2811 and
      irinotecan combination has been defined, an additional 30 patients will be enrolled to
      assess efficacy (Group 3).
