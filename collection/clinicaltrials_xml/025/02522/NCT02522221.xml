    <textblock>
      TACT is a &quot;real world&quot; randomized controlled trial of tecarfarin, a novel vitamin K
      antagonist, vs. warfarin. The quality of anticoagulation control will be compared for the
      two groups of subjects who require chronic oral anticoagulation for a broad panel of
      indications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3000 subjects with indications for chronic anticoagulation will be randomized to either
      tecarfarin or warfarin for at least one year (6 months for some VTE subjects). The study
      will be fully enriched with at least 1200 of the subjects having a mechanical heart valve as
      the primary indication for chronic anticoagulation. The remaining 1800 subjects will be
      required to be taking a chronic medication concomitantly which is known to interact with
      CYP2C9.

      The primary endpoint will be a comparison of Time in the Therapeutic Range (TTR) for a
      nested, blinded population of all subjects who are taking a chronic medication which is
      known to interact with CYP2C9 and who have a CYP2C9 genetic variant allele.
