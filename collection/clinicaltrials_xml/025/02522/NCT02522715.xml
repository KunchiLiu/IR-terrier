  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of cabazitaxel when given
      together with enzalutamide in treating patients with prostate cancer that has spread to
      other places in the body (metastatic) and has not responded to treatment with hormones
      (hormone-resistant). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cabazitaxel, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Androgen can cause the growth of prostate
      cancer cells. Hormone therapy using enzalutamide may fight prostate cancer by blocking the
      use of androgen by the tumor cells. Giving cabazitaxel together with enzalutamide may work
      better in treating metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of combination treatment with enzalutamide and
      cabazitaxel (as determined by percent dose limiting toxicities (DLT), where DLT &lt; 17% is
      consistent with it being a tolerable combination).

      II. To determine the efficacy of treatment with the hormonal agent enzalutamide and the
      chemotherapy cabazitaxel in combination in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC) (as determined by percent of patients achieving &gt;= 90% prostate specific
      antigen (PSA) declines following initiation of treatment).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further define the anticancer effect and safety profile of the combination of
      enzalutamide and cabazitaxel.

      II. Collect toxicity data (description of adverse events). III. Determine PSA response
      (percent of patients who achieve &gt;= 50% PSA decline and &gt;= 30% PSA decline).

      IV. Examine pharmacokinetic (PK) data of cabazitaxel to characterize enzalutamide and
      cabazitaxel pharmacokinetic blood levels.

      V. Determine tumor response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for
      measurable disease and Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria for non-measurable (bone)
      disease.

      VI. Determine overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine baseline (and at progression) biological tumor characteristics to evaluate
      for possible biomarkers indicative or predictive of response: apoptosis by cleaved caspase
      3; androgen signaling axis (including but not limited to: androgen receptor expression,
      androgen receptor splice variants, and intratumoral androgen levels), and glucocorticoid
      receptor.

      II. To collect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and determine the degree to which tumor
      characteristics (delineated above) are shared by the CTCs.

      III. To collect plasma and serum pre-treatment and at progression for assessment of
      circulating micro-ribonucleic acid (RNA)s and other circulating markers.

      IV. To collect buffy coat to evaluate for steroid transporters.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of cabazitaxel.

      Patients receive cabazitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and enzalutamide orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 (days 2-21 of course 1). Patients also receive prednisone
      PO twice daily (BID) as standard of care with cabazitaxel. Courses repeat every 21 days for
      6-10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may
      continue enzalutamide PO QD on days 1-28 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 6
      months for up to 5 years.
