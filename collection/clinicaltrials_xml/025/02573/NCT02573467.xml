  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This extension study will provide data to further evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of three doses of BYM338 and to assess the long-term effects of BYM338 in
      patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis. Patients who complete the core study and
      qualify for this extension study will enter Treatment Period 1, during which they will
      continue on the study drug which they were receiving in the core study (either one of the
      three BYM338 doses or placebo). Treatment Period 1 will continue until the dose of BYM338
      with the best benefit-risk profile is determined and selected. The duration of Treatment
      Period 1 could be up to one year (but estimated to be between 6 and 8 months) and the total
      duration of Treatment Period 1 will depend upon the timing of selection of the dose for
      Treatment Period 2. Once the dose with the best benefit-risk profile is selected, all
      ongoing subjects (including those who have been receiving placebo) will enter Treatment
      Period 2 and will be switched to open-label treatment with BYM338 at the selected dose.
      Treatment Period 2 will continue until BYM338 is approved and commercially available in the
      country of the investigational site.

    <description>The sIFA is a self-administered, patient reported questionnaire designed to assess the impact of sIBM on patient reported physical functioning. The sIFA consists of 11 items scored on an 11 point numerical rating scale from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (unable to do) across three domains: upper body functioning, lower body functioning and general functioning.</description>

    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a physical performance test which evaluates lower extremities function by using tests of gait speed, ability to keep standing balance, and time to rise from a chair five times. A five-level categorical score is used for each test (ranging from 0 = inability to complete the test and 4 = the highest level of performance). A summary performance score is created by summation of the scores for tests of standing balance (side by side stand, semi-tandem stand, and tandem stand), gait speed, and rising from a chair 5 times.</description>
