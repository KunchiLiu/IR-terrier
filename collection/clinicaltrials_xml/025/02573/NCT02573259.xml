  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protocol B8011001 is a Phase 1, open-label, multi center, multiple-dose, dose escalation,
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) study of PF-06801591 administered
      intravenously/subcutaneous in previously treated adult patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic melanoma, SCCHN, ovarian carcinoma, sarcoma, or relapsed or refractory cHL or
      other solid tumors. This 2 Part study will assess the safety and tolerability of increasing
      dose levels of intravenous (IV)/subcutaneous (SC) PF-06801591 and in Part 2 will establish
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      Protocol B8011001 is a Phase 1, open-label, multi center, multiple-dose, dose escalation,
      safety, PK, and PD study of PF-06801591 administered intravenously/subcutaneous in
      previously treated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, SCCHN,
      ovarian carcinoma, sarcoma, or relapsed or refractory cHL or other solid tumors.

      The first part of the study, Part 1 dose escalation, will assess the safety and tolerability
      of increasing dose levels of intravenous/subcutaneous PF-06801591 in patients with selected
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors in order to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      using a modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) design. The second part of the study,
      Part 2 dose expansion, will expand enrollment to a restricted number of tumor types and
      doses based on the findings from Part 1 to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).
