      Psychological treatments are effective, but take a long time and can be burdensome.
      Therefore, avenues to optimize behavioral treatments are needed. Despite important
      advancements, neuroscience has had a limited effect on psychotherapy development. Therefore,
      one paradigm shift would be to develop neuroscience informed behavioral treatments.

      The investigators identified from the literature a problem that affects several mental
      disorders (emotion dysregulation) and a neural circuit that underlies this important
      concern. They found that this circuit is dysfunctional in those with psychopathology but can
      be changed with treatment. The goal is in one session to train this brain network to operate
      more efficiently and to test the short and long term effects of this intervention. The
      investigators plan to engage this brain network using a traditional psychotherapy strategy
      (cognitive restructuring) and to enhance learning using repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS), a neuromodulation technique through which magnetic stimulation enhances
      the electrical activity in brain areas close to the scalp.

      The study team proposes to include 65 participants divided into 3 groups. All participants
      will be trained in emotion regulation by first being asked to remember an event where they
      experienced a negative emotion and then being instructed either to think differently about
      the event, or to wait. Participants will simultaneously undergo either real (left or right
      side of brain) or sham rTMS. The investigators will measure their regulation in the lab and
      during a-week long naturalistic assessment. Participants will return to rate feasibility,
      acceptability, and to provide feedback. If successful, this proof of concept study can open
      new frontiers for neuroscience informed treatment development.

    <textblock>
      Despite significant advancements in psychiatric research, the majority of adults with mental
      health disorders do not benefit from current evidence-based treatments, especially if they
      have difficulties managing negative emotions. One solution to this unmet clinical need is to
      take a neuroscience-informed approach to treatment development in order to radically change
      patient care. Despite an explosion of research on the neurobiological underpinnings of
      emotion, emotion regulation, and psychopathology, there have been few attempts to use such
      findings to advance behavioral treatments. Neuroscience-informed treatment development could
      optimize psychotherapy gains and reduce burden on therapists and clients. Therefore, we
      propose to build a fundamentally novel approach to treating difficulties managing negative
      emotions (or emotion dysregulation) that builds on the strength of current therapies, but
      that also accelerates and enhances gains.

      Adults with several different psychiatric disorders have difficulty managing negative
      emotions, a problem that has been traced back to impairments in the fronto-limbic brain
      circuitry. In healthy samples this neural network is activated in response to tasks
      requiring regulation of emotional arousal and disrupting this circuit leads to psychiatric
      symptoms. In psychiatric samples, this circuit is underperforming as evidenced by (1)
      hyperactivity in the amygdala (the brain structure that signals emotional arousal), (2) slow
      return to baseline after amygdala activation, (3) hypoactivity in frontal regions
      (responsible for regulation), and (3) insufficient cross-talk between these regions when
      patients experience negative emotional arousal. Evidence-based cognitive-behavioral
      psychotherapy and neurostimulation are two different interventions that can remediate
      function in impaired brain circuits. Both interventions have evidence of success in changing
      the fronto-limbic network but also need improvement. Therefore, the investigators plan to
      combine magnetic brain stimulation and cognitive restructuring (an evidence-based behavioral
      treatment for difficulties managing emotions) in a one-session intervention.

      The investigators propose to recruit 65 transdiagnostic adults (i.e., who meet criteria for
      any DSM 5 disorder) who engage in cognitive restructuring with low frequency as measured by
      an established questionnaire and to randomly assign them to either real or sham repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). All included participants will practice reducing
      negative emotions (induced with standardized autobiographical stressors) using cognitive
      restructuring while undergoing high frequency or sham rTMS to the right dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex. Standardized, established procedures will be used to teach cognitive
      restructuring, to generate personalized stressors, to induce negative emotional arousal, and
      to implement the one session of rTMS. Immediate effects will be evaluated using measures of
      emotional arousal and regulation during the intervention and for one week afterwards using 8
      daily automated mobile phone calls. Long-term effects in emotion regulation, functional and
      psychiatric impairment will be examined at 1-week and 1-month follow-up interviews. The
      investigators hypothesize that rTMS will enhance cognitive restructuring by yielding a
      quicker reduction in emotional arousal when compared to sham TMS, and will lead to more
      frequent use of the cognitive restructuring in the natural environment. If successful, this
      study may be the first in a series of investigations using innovative paradigms to optimize
      treatment for psychiatric disorders and it could lead to the next generation of
      neuroscience-informed behavioral interventions.
