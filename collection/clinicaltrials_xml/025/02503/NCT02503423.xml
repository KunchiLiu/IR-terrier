  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1/2 study to assess the safety of ASTX660,
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and recommended
      dosing regimen, and to obtain preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and target
      engagement data, in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma for whom standard
      life-prolonging measures are not available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASTX660 is a synthetic small molecule dual antagonist of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
      protein (cIAP) 1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) that has been shown to
      have potent proapoptotic and tumor growth inhibitory activity in nonclinical models. ASTX660
      has not been previously evaluated in human subjects. The Phase 1 portion of the study will
      determine the MTD, RP2D, and recommended dosing regimen. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate
      activity in selected tumor types.

      Subjects will continue to receive their assigned treatment throughout the study until the
      occurrence of disease progression, death, or unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, or
      until the study is closed by the sponsor.

      Tolerability and safety of study treatment will be evaluated throughout the study by
      collection of clinical and laboratory data. In Phase 2, antitumor response will be assessed
      according to standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) using
      computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or assessed using another
      reliable method of disease evaluation appropriate for the tumor type.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Dose-escalation stage to identify the MTD and the RP2D, defined as either the MTD or a dose below the MTD that the Data and Safety Review Committee (DSRC) agree shows adequate pharmacological evidence of target engagement and/or clinical activity. Subjects will receive ASTX660 once a day for 7 consecutive days every other week of each 28-day cycle (ie, [7 days on/ 7 days off] ×2; daily dosing on Days 1-7 and 15-21). The starting dose will be escalated stepwise in successive cohorts of 3 to 6 evaluable subjects each (standard 3+3 study design), until the RP2D is determined.</description>

If Part 3 is conducted, the plan is to enroll up to 18 evaluable subjects in 1 or more cohorts using a standard 3+3 study design.</description>
