      The purpose of this study is to evaluate programming options in spinal cord stimulation for
      the management of chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and limbs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, open-label study evaluating programming options in spinal cord
      stimulation on pain relief. All eligible subjects will undergo a Spinal Cord Stimulation
      (SCS) device trial that includes an intraoperative programming trial. Subjects experiencing
      a positive response to the programming parameters (improvement in average overall pain
      relief) during the trial from baseline will move forward with a permanent implant. Those not
      reporting a positive response to the programming parameters will be exited from the study.

      The subjects will complete a number of assessment worksheets to characterize their Quality
      of Life and function and the level of pain they are experiencing from the baseline to 3
      months post neurostimulation trial.

    <description>Self reported daily average overall pain score 5 days prior to baseline and at 3 months post device activation in subjects receiving programming options in spinal cord stimulation. The question is scored 0-10 (0=no pain; 10=pain as bad as can be).</description>

    <description>Evaluate study subject impression of change as measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change questionnaire. The questionnaire encompasses change in ACTIVITY LIMITATIONS, SYMPTOMS, EMOTIONS, and OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, scored on a scale of 1-7 (1=no change or the condition has gotten worse: 7=A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference).</description>
