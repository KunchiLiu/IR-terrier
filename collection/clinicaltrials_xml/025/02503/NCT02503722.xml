  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of transducer of regulated CREB
      activity 1/2 (TORC1/2) inhibitor INK128 when given together with epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) inhibitor AZD9291in treating patients with advanced EGFR mutation positive
      non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) and has
      progressed after treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128
      and EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MLN0128 (TORC1/2
      inhibitor INK128) in combination with AZD9291 (EGFR inhibitor AZD9291) in patients with
      advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive (EGFRm) non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). (Dose escalation phase) II. To evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy
      of MLN0128 in combination with AZD9291 in patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC that is
      negative for the resistance mutation T790M (T790M negative [-]). (Dose expansion phase)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pharmacokinetic profiles of MLN0128 in combination with AZD9291. II. To
      evaluate the response rate, disease control rate and progression free survival of the
      combination.

      III. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination by studying
      baseline biopsies, resistance biopsies, and serial plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128.

      Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 3, 5, 8,
      10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26 (day 1 is omitted in course 1). Patients also receive
      EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 8
      weeks thereafter.
