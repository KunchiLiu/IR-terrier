      This is a multicenter, open label, single arm study of Toca 511 and Toca FC. Based on their
      cancer diagnosis (brain metastases from non small cell lung cancer or breast cancer;
      colorectal cancer with liver metastases; metastatic renal cell carcinoma; locally advanced
      or recurrent melanoma; locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer or breast cancer
      [ie, other than resectable brain metastases]) subjects will receive Toca 511 either
      intravenously (IV) or intralesionally (IL). Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled for each
      disease group. In all but the melanoma group, Toca 511 will be administered by IV injection
      for 3 consecutive days (14 mL per day); in the melanoma group, at least 3 subjects may
      receive Toca 511 by IV injection (same dosing regimen as the other 3 groups), and at least 3
      subjects will receive Toca 511 by IL injection (approximately 0.1 mL to 4 mL for 5
      consecutive days). Based on the disease group, subjects will have either multiple core
      biopsies or a resection of a metastatic lesion (primary for subjects with renal cell
      carcinoma undergoing debulking nephrectomy), approximately 14 to 28 days after Toca 511
      administration. A portion of the resected or biopsied tumor sample will be evaluated for the
      presence of Toca 511 vector sequences and markers for disease characteristics. After
      recovery from the biopsy or surgery (approximately 4-6 weeks from Toca 511 treatment start),
      subjects will begin the first cycle of oral Toca FC (ie, a 7 day course of 220 mg/kg/day;
      thereafter, cycles of 7-day courses of Toca FC will be repeated approximately every 6
      weeks). Toca FC may be continued alone or in conjunction with standard therapy (other
      investigational treatments prohibited). One or more disease groups may be expanded to allow
      replacement of subjects or to provide a better assessment of efficacy. Subjects will be
      followed for safety for up to 15 years as required by regulatory authorities. In addition,
      subjects will be followed for efficacy (objective response and survival).
