    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell
      lymphoma (rrPMBCL) or relapsed or refractory Richter Syndrome (rrRS) will receive
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475). The efficacy of pembrolizumab in the treatment of rrPMBCL and rrRS
      will be evaluated.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue for a maximum of 35 administrations
      (approximately 2 years) or until documented disease progression by investigator assessment,
      unacceptable adverse event(s) (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further
      administration of treatment, participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant,
      noncompliance with study treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons.
