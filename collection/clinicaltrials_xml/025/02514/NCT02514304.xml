    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter, two component observational and standardized case-control
      study is to evaluate risk factors of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with a prospective
      3-month and 12-month follow-up to examine outcomes and their possible causes.

    <textblock>
      Antithrombotic therapies are effective for prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events but
      cause bleeding. Emerging evidence indicates that extra-cranial bleeding is just as important
      as myocardial infarction as a marker of risk for subsequent non-fatal and fatal CV events,
      but this issue has not been prospectively studied. If the association between bleeding and
      CV events is causal, prevention of bleeding, by targeting the risk factors, and prevention
      of the complications of bleeding, by targeting the causal pathways, could substantially
      reduce the burden of bleeding-related CV events. Progress in developing these approaches has
      been limited by a knowledge gap. Known risk factors do not fully explain bleeding risk and
      the investigators do not understand the mechanisms linking bleeding with adverse outcome and
      whether the association is causal.

      One-half of bleeds that lead to CV events in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy arise
      in the GI tract. INTERBLEED- Pilot Hamilton Ontario plans to explore risk factors for GI
      bleeding, and outcomes after GI bleeding, in this well-circumscribed and important group
      using a case-control design with prospective 3 month and 12 month follow-up.

      Specific objectives are to: (1) identify risk factors for GI bleeding and estimate their
      population attributable risk; (2) determine the risk of non-fatal and fatal CV events and
      functional outcomes after GI bleeding; and (3) explore the possible mechanisms linking GI
      bleeding with CV outcome 300 case-control pairs from 4 centres in Hamilton, Ontario in
      Canada will be recruited over a 24-month period. Data will be collected on patient
      characteristics, medical history and, in cases, the work-up, management and outcomes after
      bleeding. Data from the INTERBLEED-Pilot Hamilton Ontario will inform the design of the
      larger study that ultimately will help to develop new approaches to reducing the burden of
      bleeding-related CV events.
