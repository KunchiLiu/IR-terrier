    <textblock>
      The primary objective of part A of this open label phase I dose escalation study is to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 836909 administered by continuous i.v.
      infusion in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.

      The primary objective of this of part B of this open label, phase I, dose escalation study
      is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 836909 given as daily subcutaneous
      injection in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.

      The secondary objectives are for both parts of the study:

        1. Recommended doses for further development in Phase II

        2. To provide preliminary findings on the safety profiles and assess pharmacokinetic
           profile of BI 836909

        3. To assess pharmacodynamic and anti-tumoral activity of BI 836909...

          -  Relapse or progression of disease with an indication for therapy as per
             investigator´s judgement at time of screening
