    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antineoplastic activity of
      BLU-285, administered orally (PO), in adult patients with unresectable GIST or other
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors. The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part
      (Part 1) and an expansion part (Part 2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Part 1: Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of unresectable GIST
             or another advanced solid tumor. Patients with unresectable GIST must have disease
             that has progressed following imatinib and at least 1 of the following: sunitinib,
             regorafenib, sorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib or an experimental agent that targets
             KIT, or disease with a D842 mutation in the PDGFRα gene. Patients with an advanced
             solid tumor other than GIST must have relapsed or refractory disease without an
             available effective therapy.

        OR For Part 2:

          -  Group 1: Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of unresectable GIST that has
             progressed following imatinib and at least 1 of the following: sunitinib,
             regorafenib, sorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib, or an experimental agent that targets
             KIT, and the patient does not have a D842V mutation in PDGFRα.

          -  Group 2: Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of unresectable GIST with a D842V
             mutation in the PDGFRα gene. The PDGFRα mutation will be identified by local or
             central assessment, either in an archival tissue sample or a new tumor biopsy
             obtained prior to treatment with BLU-285.

          -  Groups 1 and 2: A tumor sample (archival tissue or a new tumor biopsy) has been
             submitted for mutational testing.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;450 milliseconds

          -  Platelet count &lt;90,000/mL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mL

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3 x the upper
             limit of normal (ULN) if no hepatic metastases are present; &gt;5 × ULN if hepatic
             metastases are present

          -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 × ULN; &gt;3 × ULN with direct bilirubin, &gt;1.5 × ULN in the
             presence of Gilbert's Disease

          -  Estimated (Cockroft-Gault formula) or measured creatinine clearance &lt;40 mL/min Brain
             malignancy or metastases to the brain

          -  History of a seizure disorder or requirement for anti-seizure medication
