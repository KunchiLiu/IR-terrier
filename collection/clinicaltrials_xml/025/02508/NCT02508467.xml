    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antineoplastic
      activity of BLU- 554 administered orally in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and an expansion part (Part
      2) exploring both a once daily (qd) and twice daily (bid) dosing schedule.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of HCC by histological examination or by non-invasive criteria
             according to European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) or American
             Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines. Patient has
             unresectable disease and has been previously treated with sorafenib, has declined
             treatment with sorafenib, or does not have access to sorafenib.

        OR

          -  In Part 1 only, confirmed diagnosis of a relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumor
             other than HCC that has evidence of aberrant FGF19/FGFR4 pathway activity [e.g. tumor
             or blood/plasma alterations including, but not limited to, 11q13.1 locus (FGF19/CCND1
