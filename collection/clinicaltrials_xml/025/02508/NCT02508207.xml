    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical mechanisms of action in lung and extrapulmonary systems of VX-661
      in combination with ivacaftor (IVA) (VX-661/IVA) in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who
      are homozygous for the F508del mutation on the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
      gene.
