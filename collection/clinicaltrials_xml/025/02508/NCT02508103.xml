    <textblock>
      This research study will look at differences among women with severe premenstrual mood
      symptoms. One goal of this study is to look at how the brains of two groups of these women
      respond to emotional information. The two groups are women who were abused early in life and
      women who were not. The study will use a brain scan to look at how certain areas of the
      brain respond to the viewing of words and pictures. Another goal of this study is to look at
      the effects of taking a nasal spray containing oxytocin (a hormone made in the brain) on
      those same brain areas during the viewing of words and pictures. Also, the investigators
      will look at whether oxytocin given in the nose improves premenstrual mood symptoms.

      Purpose: The primary objective of this pilot study is to begin to identify the central
      networks using functional neuroimaging techniques that may contribute to the greater
      impairment in emotion regulation, interpersonal relationships, and marital and family
      function in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) who also have a history of
      early life abuse (ELA).

      Based on the evidence that the mammalian neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), best known for its role
      in lactation and parturition, plays a seminal role in social affiliation, emotion
      regulation, attachment, maternal behavior, trust, and protection against stress; and because
      OT neural pathways and receptors are prominently expressed in brain regions involved in
      emotion regulation and maternal/affiliative behavior; the study will: 1) use intranasal OT
      administration as a probe to assess whether it modifies activation of central regions
      involved in emotion regulation in response to cognitive emotional tasks; and 2) whether
      daily intranasal OT administration during the premenstrual phase improves symptoms in women
      with PMDD with or without a history of ELA.
