  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first assessment of the efficacy of MEDI7510 for the prevention of
      RSV disease. It will also provide estimates of vaccine efficacy and of endpoint incidence in
      the placebo arm. It will also assess the safety and immunogenicity of concurrent dosing of
      MEDI7510 and IIV to expand on the observations made in the Phase 1b study of MEDI7510. It
      will also expand the safety database of subjects dosed with MEDI7510. The study will also
      assess the immune response to MEDI7510 in Season 1 and Season 2.

    <textblock>
      A Phase 2b, double-blind, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of MEDI7510
      in approximately 1,900 adult subjects, globally, 60 years or older. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular dose of each of 2 study vaccines
      in contralateral arms: MEDI7510 + IIV or placebo + IIV in Season 1.

      Subjects who receive MEDI7510 in the Northern Hemisphere will be re-randomized and blinded
      in Season 2 to receive either MEDI7510 + IIV or placebo + IIV in a 1:1 ratio. Clinical
      efficacy will not be assessed in Season 2; however the safety of revaccination will be
      assessed in Season 2.
