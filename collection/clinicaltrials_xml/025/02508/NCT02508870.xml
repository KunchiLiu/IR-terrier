  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, Phase 1 study of atezolizumab (anti programmed
      death-ligand 1 [anti-PD-L1] monoclonal antibody) in intermediate/high/very high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) participants, as evaluated by the International Prognostic
      Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R). Eligible participants will either have never received
      treatment with hypomethylating agent(s) (HMAs) or have relapsed or are refractory (R/R) to
      prior HMA therapy. The primary objectives of this study are to determine the safety and
      feasibility of atezolizumab therapy in these participant populations, including treatment in
      combination with azacitidine.
