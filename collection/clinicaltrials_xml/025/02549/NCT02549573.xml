      &quot;end-of-dose-off&quot; motor state during the PT Intervention Visit in subjects with PD.

    <textblock>
      Multicenter, outpatient trial to evaluate PT outcomes in subjects diagnosed with PD and
      currently using APOKYN. Those subjects who satisfy all eligibility criteria will be
      randomized to 2 treatment groups:

        1. &quot;APO+&quot; (APOKYN treatment before the PT Intervention Visit) and;

        2. &quot;APO-&quot; (APOKYN treatment withheld before the PT Intervention Visit).

      The study will have:

        -  Baseline Assessment Visit(s) - 1 day at Investigator's clinic and PT clinic

        -  APOKYN Response Verification Visit - 1 day

        -  PT Intervention Visits - for 6 weeks

        -  End-of-study Assessment Visit(s) - 1 day at Investigator's clinic and PT clinic All
           subjects will participate in a standardized PT intervention. In both treatment groups,
           ALL subjects will arrive for the PT Intervention Visit in an &quot;end-of-dose-off&quot; motor
           state. The &quot;end-of-dose-off&quot; motor state will be achieved by the subject withholding
           his/her carbidopa/levodopa dose and APOKYN dose for at least 3 hours before the PT
           Intervention Visit. It is hypothesized that the outcome of PT will be improved when
           subjects are in the &quot;on&quot; motor state during PT Intervention visits compared with being
           in the &quot;end-of-dose-off&quot; motor state during PT Intervention visits.

          -  Has orthostatic hypotension (defined as &gt;30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure
