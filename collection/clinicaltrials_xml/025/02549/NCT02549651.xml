      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MEDI4736
      alone and in combination with either tremelimumab or AZD9150 in adult subjects with relapsed
      or refractory dIffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of MEDI4736 as
      monotherapy or in combination with either tremelimumab or AZD9150. The objectives are to
      describe any dose-limiting toxicities, determine the maximum tolerated dose, and evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, efficacy, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics
      of MEDI4736 as monotherapy or in combination with either tremelimumab or AZD9150 in adult
      subjects with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
