  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct an effectiveness trial of the SafeCare model for
      parents with substantiated maltreatment. SafeCare, a behavioral parenting program will be
      compared to supportive case management (SCM), which is a process oriented service aimed at
      building rapport, providing family support, crisis management, and provision of referrals to
      additional services. The SafeCare model is a promising intervention for child maltreatment,
      but has not been broadly compared to usual services across a variety of service setting, and
      it has not been evaluated with respect to client outcomes of well-being, or service delivery
      burden, satisfaction, and perceived effectiveness. The study aims are as follows:

      (1) Compare SafeCare to SCM on parent and child outcomes including parenting skill,
      parenting stress and emotional well-being, parent-child relationship, parent and child
      well-being, and child adaptive behavior. (2) Compare SafeCare to SCM on how families and
      providers perceive each intervention, specifically with regard to burden, satisfaction, and
      program impact. (3) Compare SafeCare to SCM on ability to reduce child welfare re-reports.
      (4) Examine variability in SafeCare effects across sites and client characteristics.
