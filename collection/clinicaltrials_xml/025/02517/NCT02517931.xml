    <textblock>
      This study evaluates sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) for the treatment of postdural
      puncture headache (PDPH) in the emergency department (ED). Half of the patients will receive
      a true nerve block with lidocaine and bupivacaine. The other half will receive a placebo
      nerve block.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postdural puncture headaches (PDPH) are a common consequence of diagnostic lumbar puncture.
      The gold standard treatment for a PDPH is currently an autologous epidural blood patch
      (AEBP), which involves placing a needle into the epidural space of the spine and then
      injecting 20 ml of the patients own blood through the needle and into the epidural space to
      form a clot over the tear in the tissue layer that causes the headache. This is an invasive
      procedure that carries risks of pain, bleeding, infection, and in rare cases, neurological
      complications. We want to test the efficacy of using a less invasive procedure, called a
      sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB), for treatment of PDPH. SPGB has been used for many
      years in the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches, and there are several case
      reports of its use to successfully treat PDPH as well. SPGB simply involves applying a local
      anesthetic to the mucosa in the back of each nostril to numb the nerves that cause the
      headache. We hope that the SPGB will reduce the number of PDPH patients that require an
      AEBP.

    <description>Subjects will be asked to blow out each nostril. They will then be laid supine with a small shoulder roll and intranasal phenylephrine 0.25% (RhinallⓇ) will be sprayed once into each nostril to preemptively minimize bleeding. Sphenopalatine ganglion block will be performed by inserting long cotton tipped applicators saturated in 2% viscous lidocaine into nostril until properly seated in the posterior nasopharynx. These will be left in place for 10 minutes and then 1 mililiter of 0.5% bupivacaine will be administered down the plastic hollow shaft of each applicator via an 18g angiocatheter. The applicators will remain in place for 10 more minutes and then be removed.</description>
