    <textblock>
      Background: Pediatric asthma is the most common chronic illness among children and is
      associated with poor quality of life, activity restriction, school absences, and thousands
      of physician visits annually. The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness of
      using an innovative tracking system (CareTRx) for the self-management of asthma, including
      daily and rescue medication use, among children and adolescents with pediatric asthma.

      The primary study objective is to measure the effectiveness of using an innovative tracking
      system (CareTRx) for the self-management of asthma, including daily and rescue medication
      use, among children with asthma. The study objectives will be achieved using a pre-post
      design for the participants. The investigators aim to enroll at least 26 participants for a
      3-month intervention period. With this pilot study, the investigators hope to examine the
      impact of self-management behaviors on health outcomes including asthma symptoms and quality
      of life measures.
