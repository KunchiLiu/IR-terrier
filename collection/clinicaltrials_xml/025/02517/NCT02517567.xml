  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tear film evaporation of symptomatic soft
      contact lens wearers in the absence of contact lens wear and after at least 8 hours of
      contact lens wear.

      This study will consist of 5 visits (1 screening, 4 assessment) with a maximum of 6 days
      between assessment visits with at least 24 hours of no lens wear the day prior to the visit.
      Each subject will be randomized to wear 3 different study lenses for at least 8 hours each
      and one 8 hour day of no lens wear in a specific sequence. This study will be conducted in
      Australia.

          -  Can be successfully fitted with study lenses;

          -  Willing to wear lenses for a minimum of 8 hours prior to each study visit;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular anterior segment infection, inflammation, abnormality, or active disease that
             would contraindicate contact lens wear;

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated as determined by the investigator;
