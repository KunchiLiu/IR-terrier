  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in four deaths in the United States is due to cancer, and one in three women will
      develop cancer in her lifetime. Despite improvements in survival among other forms of
      cancer, ovarian cancer prognosis remains poor. Eighty percent of women with ovarian cancer
      will present with advanced disease (stage 3 or 4) where 5-year survival ranges from 18-34%.2
      Among patients with stage III and IV epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), recurrence rates are
      high.4 Therefore, interventions focused on preventing recurrence or slowing progression of
      EOC is a critical problem in the field. The investigators have submitted an R21 to NCI for a
      dose response exercise intervention trial to examine the dose response effects of aerobic
      exercise on biomarkers relevant to ovarian cancer progression and recurrence. The reviewers
      would like assurance that the investigators can recruit ovarian cancer patients into an
      exercise study and that these women will do the exercise protocol we plan to prescribe in
      our high dose of exercise.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of stage III-IV EOC, completed surgery,

          -  &gt; 12 months life expectancy (physician estimate),

             pulmonary, or

          -  orthopedic history that would prohibit a program of walking for exercise;
