      The purpose of the SI Joint Fusion and Decortication Using the SImmetry System study is to
      evaluate the SImmetry Sacroiliac Joint Fusion System for fusion of the SI joint and relief
      of SI joint pain symptoms.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized post market study designed to collect data on SI joint
      fusion and subject back pain following implant of the SImmetry device. The study will be
      conducted at a single site and 25 subjects will be implanted and followed through 24 months.
      Data will be collected pre-operatively, implant, and at specified follow-up time points
      through 24 months.

    <description>SImmetry
The SImmetry device is commercially available. The implanted devices consist of a range of threaded, self-tapping, cannulated implants designed to transfix the sacrum and ilium, providing stability for intra-articular fusion.
The SImmetry Surgical Instruments include standard manual surgical instruments used to access and prepare the sacroiliac joint space for intra-articular fusion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be indicated for the SImmetry device according to the approved SImmetry
             labeling

          -  Subject has two (2) positive (experiences pain) Provocative Tests for SIJ pain; for
             example, Compression, Thigh Thrust, FABER, Distraction or Gaenslen's

          -  Subject has documentation of failed, non-operative management of SIJ pain for ≥ 6
             months prior to surgery; for example, use of medications, braces, SI belts,
             orthotics, physical therapy or manual manipulation

          -  The subject has two (2) diagnostic SIJ injection at least one (1) resulting in a ≥50%
             decrease in pain in the joint(s) from the anesthetic portion of the injection

          -  The subject has VAS back pain score of ≥ 50 mm

          -  The subject is at least 18 years of age and skeletally mature

          -  The subject agrees and is able to comply with study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

             in the study

          -  The subject has pelvic soft tissue or bony tumors

          -  The subject has had any trauma causing fracture of the sacrum or iliac bones or has
             had spinal trauma leading to a neurological deficit

          -  The subject has a history of a central nervous system (CNS) disorder(s)

          -  The subject is indicated for or awaiting other spine surgery

             an interview

          -  The subject is receiving or seeking worker's compensation, disability remuneration,
             and/or involved in litigation related to low back or SIJ pain

          -  The subject has a history of significant emotional or psychosocial disturbance
             (untreated or uncontrolled anxiety attacks, obsessive/compulsive disorders,
