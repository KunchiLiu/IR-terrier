      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of HORIZANT 300 mg and 600
      mg, compared to placebo, at 12 weeks of treatment, for the treatment of Restless Legs
      Syndrome (RLS) in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female adolescent patients, aged 13 to 17 years, diagnosed with RLS based on
             the IRLSSG consensus criteria (Allen RP 2014) (Appendix 2).

          2. Total RLS severity score of 15 or greater on the IRLS rating scale at Visit 1
             (screening) and at Visit 2 (baseline) (Appendix 8).

          3. RLS symptoms for at least 4 of 7 consecutive evenings/nights during the screening
             period.

          4. Body weight greater than 33.4 kg and a healthy weight using age-based body mass index
             (BMI) range 5th-85th percentile at screening and baseline. Appendix 3 contains
             BMI-for-age charts that can be consulted.

          5. Estimated creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault
             equation) at screening only.

          6. Signed patient and parent Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed
             consent/assent form (as applicable) before any study-related procedures are
             performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of a primary sleep disorder other than RLS that may significantly affect the
             symptoms of RLS.

          2. Serum ferritin level &lt; 20 ng/mL at screening.

          3. History of allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to HORIZANT or any other
             gabapentin products (eg, Neurontin®, Gralise®).

          4. Suffering from a movement disorder that could mimic or confound the accurate
             diagnosis of RLS (eg, Tourette's syndrome, tic disorder, periodic limb movement
             disorder [PLMD], sleep disorders).

          5. Currently meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fifth Edition
             (DSM-5) criteria for substance use disorder, or history thereof, within 12 months
             before dosing.

          6. Current or past history of any significant psychiatric disorder including, but not
             limited to, depression (treatment with antidepressants), bipolar disorder, or
             schizophrenia.

          7. Diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is allowed, provided the
             patient is not receiving medication(s) known to affect the assessment of RLS.

          8. History of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation as indicated by the C-SSRS,
             administered at screening (the questionnaire is provided in Appendix 4), and as per
             investigator's judgment.

          9. History of seizure disorder or at increased risk for development of a seizure
             disorder including, but not limited to, complicated febrile seizure and history of
             significant head injury.

         10. Medical condition or disorder that would interfere with the action, absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of gabapentin enacarbil, or, in the
             investigator's judgment is considered to be clinically significant and may pose a
             safety concern, or, could interfere with the accurate assessment of safety or
             efficacy, or could potentially affect a patient's safety or study outcome.

         11. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory result or physical examination finding not
             resolved by the time of baseline assessments.
