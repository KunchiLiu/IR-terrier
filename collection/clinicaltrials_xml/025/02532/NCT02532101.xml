      Diabetes Mellitus is a global health issue causing significant mortality and morbidity.
      According to Diabetes Atlas, the Middle East region currently leads with the highest number
      of diabetic patients, while Malaysia is rapidly catching up with an estimated prevalence of
      12.2% (~3.3 million patients) by 2035. In Malaysia, the First National Health and Morbidity
      Survey (NHMS I) conducted in 1986 reported a prevalence of diabetes mellitus of 6.3%, which
      increased to 8.2% in the Second National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS II) conducted 10
      years later, in 1996. By 2006, the prevalence of diabetes among Malaysian population aged 18
      years and above had risen to 11.6% (NHMS III) and this figure rose further to 15.2% in year
      2011 (NHMS IV).

      Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance, impaired
      insulin signalling and β-cell dysfunction, abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism,
      sub-clinical inflammation and increased oxidative stress; these metabolic disorders lead to
      long-term pathogenic conditions including micro- and macro-vascular complications such as
      neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, stroke, myocardial infarction and a consequent
      decrease in quality of life and increase in the rate of mortality.

      Based on the current understanding of pathophysiology of insulin resistance and type 2
      diabetes, multiple pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been developed
      with the aim of improving glycemic control and prevention of diabetes complications,
      including the use of functional foods and their bioactive components.

      Recent studies suggest the potential of polyphenols as a supplementary treatment for
      diabetes mellitus owing to their biological properties. Polyphenols are natural
      phytochemical compounds found in fruits and vegetables. The most common group of phenolic
      compounds in our diet are phenolic acids and flavonoids. The two main classes are
      hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives.

      Polyphenols are gaining popularity due to their various health-promoting effects including
      blood glucose modulation. The potential efficacy of polyphenols on glucose homeostasis and
      carbohydrate metabolism is being aggressively investigated in in vitro, animal models and
      clinical trials. The anti-hyperglycemic property of polyphenols is mainly contributed by the
      reduction of dietary carbohydrate absorption through intestines, improvement of β-cell
      function and insulin action, stimulation of insulin secretion, modulation of the enzymes
      involved in glucose metabolism, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.

      The key enzymes responsible for the digestion of dietary carbohydrates to glucose are
      α-glucosidase and α-amylase. One of the most well-known properties of polyphenols especially
      phenolic acids on carbohydrate metabolism is the inhibition of these enzymes. Some
      investigations have shown that polyphenols are also able to regulate postprandial glycemia
      and inhibit the development of glucose intolerance by a facilitated insulin response and
      increased secretion of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagonlike
      polypeptide-1 (GLP-1).

      In addition, polyphenols are able to regulate the key pathways involved in carbohydrate
      metabolism and hepatic glucose homeostasis. These include glycolysis, glycogenesis and
      gluconeogenesis, which are usually impaired in diabetes. In a study using diabetic rats,
      ferulic acid, a hydroxycinnamic acid derivate, has been found to effectively increase plasma
      insulin and suppress blood glucose level by elevating glucokinase activity and production of
      glycogen in the liver. Supplementation of diabetic rats with citrus bioflavonoids, was
      accompanied with increased hepatic glucokinase activity and glycogen content, attenuated
      hepatic gluconeogenesis via decrease the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase and
      phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and subsequent improvement of glycemic control.
      Green tea polyphenols have been shown to attenuate hyperglycemia and hepatic glucose output
      via down regulation the expression of liver glucokinase and upregulation of PEPCK. In an in
      vitro study, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), one of the most abundant catechins in green
      tea, activated the AMP-activated protein kinase as a required pathway for the inhibition of
      gluconeogenic enzymes expression.

      Dietary polyphenols also influence the peripheral glucose uptake in both insulin sensitive
      and non-insulin sensitive tissues. One study showed that phenolic acids stimulated glucose
      uptake as effective as metformin and thiazolidinediones, the main common oral hypoglycemic
      drugs used in diabetic patients. Other in-vitro studies showed that some polyphenols such as
      quercetin, resveratrol and epigalocatechin gallate improved insulin-dependent glucose uptake
      in muscle cells and adipocytes by translocation of glucose transporter to plasma membrane
      mainly through induction of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. AMPK has a key
      role in metabolic control as it is an important sensor of cellular energy status. The
      activation of this pathway is considered as a new treatment for obesity, type 2 diabetes,
      metabolic syndrome and a main target for anti-diabetic drugs including metformin.
      Interestingly, the effect of polyphenols in activation of AMPK was reported to be 50-200
      times more than metformin.

      Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in pancreatic β-cells plays a pivotal role in the
      development of diabetes. It is believed that some polyphenols are able to protect β-cells
      from damage secondary to hyperglycemia and oxidation. Oral administration of phenolic-rich
      chestnut extract in diabetic rats had favourable effects on serum glucose and viability of
      β-cell through attenuation of oxidative stress, enhancing the natural antioxidant system,
      and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Some protective effects of polyphenols on β-cells are
      related to the ability to modulate key cellular signalling pathways. The anthocyanin-rich
      Chinese bayberry extract showed protective effects for pancreatic β cells against oxidative
      damage through up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1, modulation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt
      signaling pathway and inhibition of β cell apoptosis.

      The current study focuses on the glucose-controlling properties of phenolic compounds
      extracted from oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), a high oil-producing tropical plant that also
      rich in phytochemicals. The technology for harvesting water-soluble antioxidants from the
      oil palm was recently developed enabling the recovery of oil palm phenolics (OPP) from the
      vegetation liquor of the palm oil milling process.. The major phenolic components in OPP are
      identified as caffeoylshikimic acid, protocatechuic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid. OPP has
      been found to exert various positive health effects parallel to the well-established
      physiological benefits of polyphenols. It has been shown that OPP protects against early
      type 2 diabetes and encouraging results suggest its role in modulating the development of
      diabetes. The current study aims to investigate and determine the effects of oil palm
      phenolics (OPP) on the blood glucose control in patients with uncontrolled insulin treated
      type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      A Phase I clinical trial (NMRR ID: NMRR-08-1618-3108) was conducted in 2011 with the aim of
      evaluating the health benefits of OPP and evaluate any adverse reaction to the OPP
      preparation in healthy volunteers. The study using dose up to 150 ml of 1500 ppm GAE, twice
      daily, i.e. 450 mg GAE per day, involved 25 healthy volunteers and showed no serious adverse
      effect.

      Study reported that providing OPP between 900 and 1800 mg/lGAE ad libitum to Nile rats
      blocked diabetes progression in this spontaneous diabetes model. Based on an average rat
      weight of 300 g and 30-35ml/day OPP consumption, the average equivalent consumption by a
      60kg human subject would be about 1000 ml, calculated based on the body surface area
      normalisation method. Thus, in order to exert clinically significant effect, the current
      study will apply up to 1000 mg GAE per day. Doses as high as 3000 mg/l GAE in rats (which
      translates to 3000mg GAE consumption per day by humans) showed no adverse effects.
