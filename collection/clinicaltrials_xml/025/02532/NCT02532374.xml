  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD,
      i.e., subjective effects) profiles, and the safety and tolerability of the
      nicotine-containing aerosol delivered by Platform 3 Liquid (P3L) system at three different
      nicotine levels in smoking healthy subjects in Relation to Nicorette®.
