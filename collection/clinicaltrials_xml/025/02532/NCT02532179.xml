  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label trial of mouse allergenic extract administered by subcutaneous
      injection in adults with asthma and mouse sensitivity. The study is designed to evaluate:

        -  the safety of this therapy when given by injection

        -  biomarkers of the immune response and

        -  whether the therapy would be effective in treating allergic asthma.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of the study is to assess if treatment with mouse subcutaneous
      immunotherapy (SCIT), using the per protocol allergenic extract doses, is safe. This will be
      done by determining the rate of related adverse events and serious adverse events in the
      course of treatment.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  determination of whether a 24 week treatment with mouse SCIT, using the per protocol
           allergenic extract doses, will induce a 3-fold increase in mouse-specific serum
           immunoglobulin E (IgE)

        -  determination of whether a 24 week treatment with mouse SCIT, using the per protocol
           allergenic extract doses, will induce changes in the serum levels of mouse-specific
           immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin subclass 4 (IgG4).

             NAEPP classification, as evidenced by at least one of the following:

               -  Requires a dose of greater than 500 mcg of fluticasone per day or the equivalent
                  of another inhaled corticosteroid;

               -  Have received more than 2 courses of oral or parenteral corticosteroids within
                  the last 12 months;

               -  Have been treated with depot steroids within the last 12 months;

               -  Have been hospitalized for asthma within the 6 months prior to recruitment;

               -  Have had a life-threatening asthma exacerbation that required intubation,
                  mechanical ventilation, or that resulted in a hypoxic seizure within 2 years
                  prior to recruitment.

          -  Do not have access to a phone (needed for scheduling appointments);

          -  Have received allergen immunotherapy (SLIT or SCIT) in the last 12 months prior to
