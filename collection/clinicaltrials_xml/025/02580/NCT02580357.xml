      The aim of this study was to compare two intensities of LLLT on wound healing process of the
      donor palatine area after CTG removal.

      This is a prospective, parallel and controlled clinical trial. The population evaluated in
      the study was selected at Science and Technology Institute - ICT- São José dos Campos,
      College of Dentistry.

      Patients were assigned to one of the three treatment groups:

        -  Group 60 (Test, n=18): Periodontal surgery for root coverage through connective tissue
           graft and LLLT application on donor site using a 60 J/cm² dose.

        -  Group 30 (Test, n=18): Periodontal surgery for root coverage through connective tissue
           graft and LLLT application on donor site using a 30 J/cm² dose.

        -  Group Sham (Control, n= 18): Periodontal surgery for root coverage through connective
           tissue graft and LLLT SHAM on donor site.

      All surgeries were performed by the same expert periodontist (MPS). Before the surgical
      procedure, all patients were enlightened about the causes and consequences of gingival
      recession and prevention techniques. Factors related to the origin of gingival recession,
      such as toothbrush trauma and inflammation caused by biofilm, were controlled through
      instruction on standardized brushing technique to avoid the influence of other hygiene
      methods capable of promoting trauma on soft tissues. Standardized dental floss and
      toothbrushes were given to patients. The surgical technique adopted in the recession defects
      was the trapezoidal-type of CAF and the connective tissue graft was removed from palate
      mucosa . Briefly, a first incision on the palate was performed perpendicularly to the long
      axis of the teeth, 2 to 3 mm apical to the gingival margin. The mesial-distal length of the
      incision was determined by the length of the graft required to cover the recession. Because
      the selected recessions were in maxillary canines and premolars, the lengths of the graft
      varied minimally (10-12mm). The second incision was made parallel to the first one (1-2 mm
      apically and parallel to the long axis of the teeth) to separate the subepithelium
      connective tissue from the epithelial layer. The incision is carried far enough apically to
      provide a 7- mm height of connective tissue to cover the denuded root surface. Afterward,
      another incision parallel to the long axis of the teeth starting from the first incision was
      performed to separate the subepithelium connective tissue from the periosteum. Then, the
      connective tissue graft was removed from the palate as atraumatically as possible. Single
      sutures were made on the palate (4-0 silk) and the graft was sutured on the receptor site.

      The evaluated parameters were wound remaining area (WRA), scar and tissue colorimetry (TC),
      tissue thickness (TT) and postoperative discomfort (D), evaluated at baseline and 7, 14, 45,
      60, and 90 days after surgery.

      Statistical Analysis: All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or expressed in
      percentages during the descriptive phase. Data were analyzed according to distribution by
      the Shapiro-Wilk test. For the remaining wound area, tissue colorimetry, tissue thickness,
      and postoperative discomfort parameter analysis, two way repeated measures ANOVA was
      performed for intra- and intergroup analysis. T test was used for intergroup comparison of
      the number of analgesics taken. The presence or absence of scars was measured by Q-square
      test. Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Plot 12.0. In all tests a significance
      level of 0.05 was chosen.

    <description>For this, standardized photographs were taken (brightness, distance and angle). A scale was used as a reference to measure this area.

    <time_frame>7, 14, 45, and 60 days after surgical procedure</time_frame>
    <description>After air jet application, patients were requested to score postoperative discomfort through on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 10 centimeters, in which 0 meant &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 meant &quot;extreme pain&quot;. After this, a postoperative discomfort average for all groups was obtained.</description>

    <description>Through four fixed points marked 5 and 7 mm from the gingival margin in the operated region, tissue thickness of palatine masticatory mucosa. One stent was made to standardize the points to be measured. The stent was positioned, and with a periodontal probe and the points were marked. Then the stent was removed and measurements were taken. For this, an endodontic spacer with a rubber cursor was put on the marked points for it to reach the palatine bone plate. Then the cursor was taken to the tissue carefully to not pressuring it. The distance between the spacer tip and the cursor was measured using a digital pachymeter and measured in millimeters (mm).</description>

    <description>The patients allocated to the control group received sham irradiation. For this, black rubber protection was placed at the tip of the laser device, which did not allow the light to reach the tissue. The applications were performed by a different operator (CAS) from the one who measured the study parameters. During irradiation, the tip of the laser probe was placed perpendicularly with slight contact on the area. Laser therapy was initiated in the immediate postoperative period (just after sutures) and was repeated by six more applications performed every other day, with a total of 7 laser applications.</description>

    <description>The irradiation was performed with a GaAlAs diode laser that continuously emitted a wavelength of 660 nm with a power of 30 mW. The patients allocated for the group 60 received the following protocol for laser application: Two (2) points of irradiation were performed using a total energy density (fluence) of 60 J/cm2 and a time of 60 seconds (30 J/cm2 per point and an application time of 30 seconds per point). During irradiation, the tip of the laser probe was placed perpendicularly with slight contact on the area. Laser therapy was initiated in the immediate postoperative period (just after sutures) and was repeated by six more applications performed every other day, with a total of 7 laser applications. The power of the equipment was calibrated prior to each application.</description>
