    <textblock>
      This study investigates the use of remimazolam as a sedative/hypnotic in general anesthesia.
      Remimazolam or propofol will be administered together with fentanyl/sufentanil/remifentanil
      as opioid analgesics and a neuromuscular blocker.

      In total, 530 patients will be randomized. This group of 530 patients will be split randomly
      into 2 groups as follows:

      • 106 patients will be randomized to induction with propofol plus fentanyl or sufentanil or
      remifentanil and a neuromuscular blocker. Throughout maintenance, the patients will receive
      propofol and remifentanil until weaning from the mechanical ventilation on the ICU or PACU
      within 24 hours after induction.

      Afterwards, sedation with propofol as study medication has to be ended. If necessary, the
      sedation is to be continued with the hospital's own supplies (propofol or other sedative).

      • 424 patients will be randomized to induction with remimazolam 6.0 mg/kg/hr together with
      fentanyl or sufentanil or remifentanil and a neuromuscular blocker. Throughout maintenance,
      the patients will receive remimazolam and remifentanil until weaning from the mechanical
      ventilation on the ICU or PACU within 24 hours after induction.

      The primary endpoint is successful sedation is defined as a Narcotrend index of 60 or less
      during at least 85% of the maintenance time and no rescue sedative medication administered.
      The maintenance starts at arrival at the operation theater and ends with the completion of
      the last skin suture.

    <description>Propofol for induction will be given as a bolus administered manually at 2.0-2.5 mg/kg slowly over approximately 1 minute.

    <description>Remimazolam for induction will be given at 6.0 mg/kg/hr, which can be increased to 12.0 mg/kg/hr for one minute if loss of consciousness is not reached after 3 minutes. Immediately after the remimazolam dose for induction has been given, remimazolam maintenance will be given at 1.0 mg/kg/hr and adjusted by down-titration or up-titration to a maximum of 3.0 mg/kg/hr.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients scheduled for major non-emergency cardiac surgery assumed to require more
             than 2 hours of maintenance of general anesthesia and to require the use of
             extracorporeal circulation, including coronary bypass(es), valve replacement(s) and
             associated procedures and on-pump minimal invasive surgery
