  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical incompetence complicates approximately 1 in 500 pregnancies . Those women with
      cervical incompetence are at risk for second trimester spontaneous abortion and preterm
      labor. Cervical cerclage reduces these risks but must be performed under general or
      neuraxial anesthesia. Some anesthesiologists prefer neuraxial anesthesia, as it reduces
      fetal exposure to medications and avoids the risks associated with loss of maternal airway
      reflexes under general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia, in particular, has the added advantage
      of being technically simple while still providing a rapid, dense sensory block. For cerclage
      placement, patients require a sensory block from the T10 to S4 dermatome in order to cover
      sensation from the cervix as well as the vagina and perineum. Patients presenting for
      cerclage under spinal anesthesia pose a dosing challenge given the physiologic changes
      associated with pregnancy. As women progress with their pregnancy, they require lower doses
      of intrathecal local anesthetic to achieve similar block level. Multiple studies have
      demonstrated that these changes start during the second trimester. Inadequate sensory
      coverage with a spinal anesthetic typically necessitates conversion to general anesthesia,
      causing additional time wasted and added risk to the patient and fetus. Anecdotally, this is
      the reason why some anesthesiologists choose general anesthesia for patients undergoing
      cerclage over a spinal anesthetic. As there is currently no literature determining the
      correct dosage for these patients, we propose a dose-response study to determine the ED90 of
      intrathecal lidocaine for adequate anesthesia for elective cervical cerclage placement.The
      findings of this study will help determine the minimum dose of intrathecal lidocaine
      necessary to provide adequate spinal anesthesia for cervical cerclage for 90% of women. This
      will help decrease the frequency of inadequate anesthesia for cervical cerclage.

    <description>Dose-response data will be evaluated by fitting a 2-parameter log-logistic function given by the expression f(x) = 1/(1 + exp(b(log(x) − log (e)))) and the ED90 estimates from the fitted equations using the delta method. Confidence intervals (CIs) of the differences in ED90 estimates will be calculated using a bootstrap method with 9999 replications.
Characteristics of patients with successful vs. failed anesthetics will be compared. Categorical data will be compared with the chi-squared test; continuous data will be compared with a two-tailed t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test.</description>

    <description>Spinal anesthesia will be induced with isobaric 2% lidocaine and 15 μg fentanyl.
The study lidocaine dose will be determined using a 9:1 biased-coin sequential allocation method. For the first participant, the starting dose will be 32 mg of 2% isobaric lidocaine (1.6 mL). If the lidocaine dose provides an unsatisfactory anesthetic, the case will be categorized as a failure. After a failed case, the next participant will receive a lidocaine dose increased by 4 mg. If the lidocaine dose provides satisfactory anesthesia, the next participant's lidocaine dose will determined by a biased allocation method with a 90% chance of maintaining the dose and a 10% chance of decreasing the dose by 4 mg.</description>
