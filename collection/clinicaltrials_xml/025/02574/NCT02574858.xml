      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of orally administered QRH-882260, a
      topically administered Cy5-labeled heptapeptide specific for epithelial growth factor
      receptor (EGFR).

      This is a Phase IA study of the safety of an orally administered QRH-882260 heptapeptide for
      detection of neoplastic tissues in multiple areas of the gastrointestinal tract in humans.
      The investigators intend to enroll 10 evaluable subjects. The investigators expect to be
      able to enroll about 1-2 subjects per week, so the study should take about 1-2 months to
      complete.

      Interested, healthy subjects ages 25-100 who respond to recruitment advertising and appear
      to be eligible based on a screening questionnaire will be scheduled for a study visit at
      MCRU. At the study visit, the subjects will review and sign the informed consent and
      eligibility will be confirmed. If eligible, subjects will provide a blood sample for
      clinical labs and a urine sample for urinalysis. A baseline EKG will be recorded. A negative
      urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential is required to be eligible.
      Eligible subjects will consume the reconstituted QRH-882260 heptapeptide. After 5 minutes,
      subjects will drink a minimum 4-8 ounces of tap water. Subjects will remain in MCRU for
      observation for 30 minutes. Vital signs and an EKG will be recorded after 30 minutes.
      Subjects are required to have repeat blood draw for clinical labs and urinalysis within 24
      to 48 hours after QRH-882260 heptapeptide ingestion. The study team will conduct a follow up
      phone call to verbally assess toxicity after post-ingestion labs (within 7 days).

    <description>The first three subjects will squirt via syringe into their mouths (po) 4.2 mg (2.1ml) mg of reconstituted (with 5 ml of 0.9% saline) QRH-882260 heptapeptide (~100 µM concentration). They will be asked to wait 5 minutes and then drink at least 4-8oz of tap water. The remaining seven subjects will receive (squirted via syringe into their mouths) 1mg (5ml) of reconstituted (with 5ml of 0.9% saline) QRH-882260 heptapeptide (~100 µM concentration).</description>
