      The purpose of this study is to determine whether BCG vaccination shortly after birth can
      reduce early infant mortality in a rural setting.

  <detailed_description>

      Background: BCG and oral polio vaccines (OPV) at birth are associated with beneficial
      non-specific effects, reducing neonatal mortality by more than what can be explained by
      prevention of the target diseases. BCG is recommended at birth, but is often given much
      later, especially in rural areas. In two RCTs in Guinea-Bissau, BCG-at-birth reduced
      neonatal mortality in low birthweight (&lt;2500g; LBW) children by 48% (95%CI: 18-67%) and in
      children with a birthweight &gt;2500g (NBW), OPV+BCG vs BCG was associated with a 32% (95%CI:
      0-55%) lower mortality.

      WHO recommends home visits shortly after birth to reduce mortality, but vaccinations are not
      normally provided. If the vaccines indeed have profound effects on innate immunity and
      neonatal mortality in both LBW and NBW children many lives could be saved if BCG and OPV was
      provided earlier. We will cluster randomise villages to home visits with and without
      vaccinations. All children participating in the study will be offered routine vaccines at
      village visits by the BHP team. Thereby the study will provide earlier vaccination for all
      children.

      Hypothesis: BCG+OPV at birth provided at village visits shortly after birth will reduce
      early infant mortality by 40%.

      Methods: The study will be conducted in Biombo, Oio and Cacheu in Guinea-Bissau, where home
      visits are not yet implemented. At two-monthly visits by the BHP team all registered
      pregnant women will be offered to participate in the study. Community key informants will
      communicate information on births in the village to the BHP study team, and the study nurse
      will visit every new-born child shortly after a CKI calls, if possible on the same day.
      Villages will be randomised to receive immediate vaccination of their children shortly after
      birth or at the first visit by the BHP team.

      Statistical analyses: All children registered during pregnancy will enter the study when
      they are visited at home or at 24 hours after birth whichever comes last, thereby excluding
      deaths on the day of birth. In the main analysis, survival of vaccinated children and
      unvaccinated children will be compared in Cox proportional hazards models with age as
      underlying time and censoring of follow-up on the date of the first visit by the BHP team
      when children in the control group will also be vaccinated.

      Similar to mortality, the incidence of consultations and hospital admissions will be
      compared in survival analysis with age as underlying time scale.

      All analyses will investigate whether the effect of BCG differs by sex. We will investigate
      whether the effect differs by scar status of the mother. In addition stratified analysis by
      age and weight at enrolment will be conducted. Guinea-Bissau has two distinct seasons, a dry
      season from December to May and a rainy season from June to November. We will assess whether
      the effect in the dry season (December-May) is stronger than the effect during the rest of
      the year.

      Nutritional status will be assessed by weight at the first home visit shortly after birth
      and the first visit after 6 weeks. We will compare the obtained weight at the different ages
      to the WHO growth reference to derive a z-score for weight-for-age[18] and evaluate the
      effect on early BCG on the weight-for-age during the first 6 weeks of life in linear
      regression models.

      The effect of BCG-at-birth on BCG scar formation and scar size will be assessed in logistic
      and linear regression models. All analysis will be adjusted for clustering.

      Sample size: In the rural areas in which the current study will be conducted, mortality
      between day 1 and day 42 is 2.9%. A recent trial in Ghana indicated that three home visits
      during the first week of life to promote essential new-born care practices and to weigh and
      assess children for danger signs was associated with an 8% (-12 to 25%) reduction in
      neonatal mortality. Assuming that our single home visit reduces the neonatal mortality by a
      maximum of 10%, and the effect of BCG+OPV is at least a 40% reduction in mortality we need
      to follow 4926 new-borns (power 80%; significance level 5%; one-sided; cluster design effect
      1.1). We expect a 3% censoring due to migration, and we therefore need to enrol 5079
      new-borns. In the study villages, the annual number of births is 2300 and 65% are vaccinated
      by BHP nurses.
