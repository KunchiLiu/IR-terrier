  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric variceal obturation is the current endoscopic therapy of choice for gastric variceal
      bleeding but is associated with a high rebleeding rate. Carvedilol is a potent non-selective
      β-blocker. The role of carvedilol in the prevention of recurrent gastric variceal bleeding
      is not studied. This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of carvedilol as an adjunct to
      gastric variceal obturation in the secondary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric variceal bleeding is a lethal complication of portal hypertension. The rebleeding
      rate ranged between 30% to 50% in patients after initial hemostasis. Endoscopic
      cyanoacrylate injection is currently the choice of endoscopic therapy of acute gastric
      variceal bleeding and prevention of recurrent bleeding. However, the rebleeding rate is
      still high in the patients undergoing repeated endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection.

      Non-selective β-blockers are frequently used for the secondary prophylaxis of variceal
      bleeding. In the case of esophageal varices, combination of non-selective β-blockers and
      endoscopic therapy significantly lowers the rebleeding rate compared with endoscopic therapy
      alone. However, propranolol failed to decrease the rebleeding rate as an adjunct to
      endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection and was associated with a higher incidence of adverse
      effects in gastric variceal bleeding patients. A more potent non-selective β-blocker than
      propranolol might further decrease portal pressure and decrease the rebleeding rate.

      Carvedilol is a potent non-selective β-blocker with both beta and alpha-1 blocker effect. It
      significantly lowers portal pressure even in propranolol non-responders. However, it is
      unclear weather carvedilol will play a role in the prevention of recurrent gastric variceal
      bleeding. The investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy
      of carvedilol combined with endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection with endoscopic cyanoacrylate
      injection alone in secondary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding.
