      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of Armodafinil, CBT-I, or the combination
      of the two on the sleep continuity of persons suffering from sleep disordered breathing and
      their adherence to CBT-I and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Adults diagnosed
      with obstructive sleep apnea and who meet additional research and diagnostic criteria for
      insomnia will be recruited. Participants will submit daily sleep diaries and supplemental
      questionnaires as measures of study progress.

      Rationale:

      Insomnia and sleep disordered breathing are the most common sleep disorders and they tend to
      be highly comorbid. When they co‐occur, not only is there an increase in cumulative
      morbidity, but it is likely that these two diseases interact to: promote overall greater
      illness severity; reduce treatment adherence; and diminish treatment efficacy. The results
      from the proposed project will provide valuable information on how co‐treatment for these
      two disorders can promote improved sleep quantity, enhanced sleep quality, better compliance
      with Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy, and better daytime functioning.

      Background:

      There is now substantial evidence that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT‐I) is
      efficacious for Primary Insomnia (PI), that it is as potent as sedative hypnotic treatment,
      and better sustained over time. Further, there is now increasing evidence that CBT‐I can be
      applied to insomnias that are co‐morbid with medical and psychiatric disorders, and with
      equal efficacy. The evidence for an expanded indication, to date, has been for insomnia
      comorbid with depression, chronic pain, and cancer. Interestingly, there are very few
      studies on the efficacy of CBT‐I in insomnia comorbid with other intrinsic sleep disorders,
      including in patients with Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB). This is surprising given that
      insomnia frequently occurs comorbidly with SDB. It is estimated that 40‐60% of patients with
      SDB also suffer from insomnia. The lack of data regarding the applicability of CBT‐I to
      insomnia co‐morbid with SDB is likely due to the concern that CBT‐I will be difficult to
      tolerate in patients with insomnia co‐morbid with SDB given the treatment's tendency to
      produce acute increases in fatigue, sleepiness, and transient reductions in attention and
      performance. Accordingly, the investigators of this study propose to conduct a randomized,
      controlled trial on the effects of Armodafinil alone and in combination with CBT‐I in
      patients with Insomnia comorbid with SDB.

      Note: The choice to evaluate Armodafinil as both a monotherapy and an adjuvant therapy to
      CBT‐I for insomnia has a firm conceptual basis and is supported by preliminary data from our
      group. The choice to evaluate Armodafinil in patients with insomnia co‐morbid with SDB is
      further supported by the existing indication for sleepiness in patients with SDB.

    <description>Sleep diary attrition rates are assessed by weekly sleep continuity measures from subject's self-completed sleep diaries. Measures include: sleep latency (SL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST).
Two treatment groups will be compared for differences: 1) CBTI + armodafinil, 2) CBTI + placebo.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks of active study</time_frame>
    <description>Drop-out rates will be calculated by the number of protocol weeks the subject completed before withdrawing from the study.
Withdrawal indicates subjects who were either lost-to-follow-up (LTFU), chose to withdraw (self-withdrawn), or were withdrawn by the study's PI (withdrawn by investigator).</description>
