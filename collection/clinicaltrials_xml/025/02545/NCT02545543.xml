    <measure>The Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) ratio of each virus strain.</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after last vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Noninferiority of bioCSL QIV compared to comparator QIV will be assessed by the eight co-primary endpoints of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody geometric mean titer (GMT) and seroconversion rate (SCR) for each viral strain included in the vaccines. The GMT ratio is defined as the geometric mean of the postvaccination HI titer for the US-licensed comparator QIV over the geometric mean of the postvaccination HI titer for bioCSL QIV.</description>

    <measure>The difference in Seroconversion Rate (SCR) for each virus strain.</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days after last vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Noninferiority of bioCSL QIV compared to comparator QIV will be assessed by the eight co-primary endpoints of HI geometric mean titer (GMT) and seroconversion rate (SCR) for each viral strain. The rate of SCR is defined as the percentage of subjects with either a prevaccination HI titer &lt; 1:10 and a postvaccination HI titer ≥ 1:40, or a prevaccination HI titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥ 4-fold increase in postvaccination HI titer. For the SCR comparison, the difference between the SCR for each virus strain will be determined.</description>
