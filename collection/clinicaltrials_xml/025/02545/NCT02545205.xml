  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to establish the added value of training with the
      Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) exoskeleton system as part of regular rehabilitation
      intervention programs after stroke.

      The main specific aims are:

        -  to demonstrate the effect of training with HAL as part of current, best available,
           regular inpatient rehabilitation in comparison with the effect of current, best
           available regular inpatient rehabilitation programs only, in the post acute phase
           (starting 4-7 weeks) after stroke with regard to gait and cardio-vascular function,
           activity and participation;

        -  to explore factors that predict outcome/good responders to training with HAL;

        -  to estimate health care utilisation and cost effectiveness of using the HAL during the
           first year after stroke.

      The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of:

        -  training with HAL as part of regular inpatient rehabilitation starting 4-7 weeks after
           stroke

        -  regular inpatient rehabilitation only, on independence in ambulation after intervention
           by comparing the Functional Ambulation Category in each group.

      Secondary aims comprise the effectiveness of training with HAL on independence gait function
      and quality, cardiovascular function, activity of daily living and participation assessed at
      the end of intervention and at a 6 and 12 months follow-up. Effects on health care
      consumption during 12 months after the intervention will be explored and treatment related
      adverse events during the study will be documented. Further, associations between spasticity
      versus HAL mediated recovery will also be explored.

      Intensive gait training with HAL is performed, 1 session/day, 4 days/week during 4 weeks.
      Time for each session is individualised but does not exceed 60 minutes/session (effective
      walking time with HAL). During the 4 weeks the patients will also receive conventional gait
      training provided by regular staff at the clinic. After the intervention, conventional
      in-patient training continues until the patient is discharged to home-based rehabilitation.
      To standardize the training procedure, training with HAL is performed on a treadmill and to
      enable body weight support. Body weight support is used to prevent falls and to unburden the
      weight of the suit (9 kg). The training program is performed by physiotherapists, trained in
      the HAL method and the study procedures.

      The control group will receive conventional gait training, performed according to current
      best evidence based practice and may include over ground walking with assistance and/or
      assistant devices as well as the use of a treadmill and body weight support and training of
      gait function in activities of daily living.
