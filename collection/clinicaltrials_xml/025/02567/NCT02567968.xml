  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present clinicians have no way to reverse anesthesia. Patients wake when their bodies
      clear the anesthetic. Most people wake quickly, but some do not. All patients have memory
      and other cognitive problems after waking from anesthesia. In studies on animals, the
      investigators observed that caffeine caused rats and mice to wake much more rapidly from
      anesthesia. This was true for all the animals tested. The investigators would like to see if
      this holds true in humans. Will caffeine accelerate waking from anesthesia? Will it reverse
      the cognitive deficits associated with anesthesia, after waking?

      The investigators hope to start with a very modest pilot program. Each volunteer will be
      anesthetized twice. Each volunteer will be anesthetized one time and allowed to wake without
      the aid of any other drugs and the other time they volunteer will receive a relatively low
      dose of caffeine after anesthesia.

      If no adverse effects are observed in the Pilot program, the investigators will expand the
      study. At this dosage of caffeine, animal studies suggest approximately a dozen volunteers
      will be required to complete the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Waking Time - Time to Opening Eyes</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of the study is to determine whether caffeine speeds emergence from anesthesia. The time between terminating delivery of anesthetic and the subject opening his eyes will be measured.This measurement will constitute the &quot;waking&quot; time for each subject.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Test1 - Action Judgement Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. Half an hour after terminating anesthesia each subject will be asked to complete a series of psychomotor tests, that will assess his reaction times, his memory and his motor control (ability to move his limbs). In this test, test1, the subject will complete an action judgment test, similar to a driving test. Using a steering wheel subjects keep pointers on a track, displayed on a computer monitor. The number of mistakes made by the subject will be tracked. This will be converted into a &quot;degree of accuracy&quot; scored as percent from 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Test2 - Hand Eye Coordination Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. Half an hour after terminating anesthesia each subject will be asked to complete a series of psychomotor tests, that will assess his reaction times, his memory and his motor control (ability to move his limbs). Test2, another test for hand-eye coordination, involves tracking a randomly moving circle on a computer screen with a cross controlled by a mouse. The number of mistakes made by the subject will be tracked. This will be converted into a &quot;degree of accuracy&quot; scored as percent from 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Test3 - Reaction Time to respond to Sound Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. Half an hour after terminating anesthesia each subject will be asked to complete a series of psychomotor tests, that will assess his reaction times, his memory and his motor control (ability to move his limbs). Test3, a reaction time test, is completed by asking the subject to press a button when he hears a sound. In this test, the time between a sound taking place and the subject pushing a button in response will be measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Test4 - Word Recall Memory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. Half an hour after terminating anesthesia each subject will be asked to complete a series of psychomotor tests, that will assess his reaction times, his memory and his motor control (ability to move his limbs). Test4, a memory test, is completed by exposing subjects to 20 words, after which the subject will be asked to recall the words, order not being important. Two hours later the subject will be asked for the same words. The number of correct words remembered by the subject will be tracked. This will be converted into a &quot;degree of accuracy&quot; scored as percent from 0 to 100 by dividing the number of correct words by 20 (total number of words).</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Test5 - Digit Symbol Substitution Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. Half an hour after terminating anesthesia each subject will be asked to complete a series of psychomotor tests, that will assess his reaction times, his memory and his motor control (ability to move his limbs). Test5: The Digit Symbol Substitution Test asks subjects to substitute symbols for numbers for 60 seconds. Each time there will be different symbol number codes. This will be converted into a &quot;degree of accuracy&quot; scored as percent from 0 to 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Test6 - Time Estimation Test, Ability to estimate 30 seconds</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. Half an hour after terminating anesthesia each subject will be asked to complete a series of psychomotor tests, that will assess his reaction times, his memory and his motor control (ability to move his limbs). Test6: The subjects will also be asked to estimate a period of time, typically 30 seconds. In this test the times will be plotted directly.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Waking Time - Time To Respond to Spoken Command</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of the study is to determine whether caffeine speeds emergence from anesthesia. The time between terminating anesthetic and the subject being able to respond to a simple command (&quot;squeeze my hand&quot;) will be measured. This measurement will constitute a secondary &quot;waking&quot; time for each subject.</description>
