      The primary objective is to determine whether intralesional cidofovir is effective at
      bringing about the total or near-total resolution of warts that have already proven
      recalcitrant to standard therapy.

      The secondary objective is to determine the tolerability of this new mode of administration
      of cidofovir in the pediatric population

      This study includes pediatric patients with history of either primary or iatrogenic
      immune-suppression who are seeking treatment of warts that have already proven recalcitrant
      to standard therapy. The first cohort will include 4 patients ages 12 to 17. After all tests
      indicate treatment safety, the second cohort will be recruited and will include patients
      ages 8 to 17.
