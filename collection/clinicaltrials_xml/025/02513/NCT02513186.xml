      Primary Objective:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of isatuximab when
      administered in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone based on
      the dose-limiting toxicity(ies) (DLTs) observed in patients with newly diagnosed MM
      non-eligible for transplantation.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the overall safety profile of isatuximab in combination with
           bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone, including cumulative toxicities.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of isatuximab and combination
           components.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab in combination treatment.

        -  To evaluate the preliminary antitumoral activity of the combination.

      The duration of the study for an individual patient will include a period to assess
      eligibility (screening or baseline period) of up to 3 weeks, a treatment period including up
      to 12 induction treatment cycles (50-week duration), followed by a maintenance period of
      4-week cycles and an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last
      administration of treatment (or until the patient receives another anticancer therapy,
      whichever is earlier). Study treatment may continue until precluded by toxicity, disease
      progression, death, or upon the Investigator/patient's request.
