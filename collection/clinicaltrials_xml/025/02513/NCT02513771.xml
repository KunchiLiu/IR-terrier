      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether sitagliptin (Januvia is the brand name for
      sitagliptin) reduces inflammation and immune activation markers in HIV-infected men and
      women when compared to a placebo (inactive medication like a dummy pill). The study will
      evaluate whether taking 100 mg of sitagliptin by mouth daily for 16 weeks is safe and
      effective for HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who do not have diabetes.
      Sitagliptin is a medication that is used to treat people with diabetes (high blood sugar)
      but also may reduce inflammation in the body.

             protease inhibitor boosted with low dose ritonavir, an integrase inhibitor, or an
             NNRTI. (Other ART regimens may be acceptable. Sites must consult the protocol team
             for approval)
