      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of beclomethasone
      dipropionate administered via BAI at a dose strength of 40 or 80 mcg per oral inhalation
      (320 or 640 mcg/day, respectively) compared with placebo treatment in patients with
      persistent asthma as assessed by the standardized baseline-adjusted trough morning (pre-dose
      and pre-rescue bronchodilator) Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) area under the
      effect curve from time 0 to 6 weeks (AUEC[0-6wk]).

          -  The patient has a history of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years preceding SV.

          -  The patient has had an asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 1

          -  The patient has initiated immunotherapy (administered by any route) less than 90 days
             before the SV or had a dose escalation of immunotherapy less than 30 days before the
             SV.

          -  The patient is unable to tolerate or unwilling to comply with the required washout
             periods and withholding of all applicable medications.

             clinical investigational center.

          -  A member of the patient's household is participating in the study at the same time.
             (However, after the enrolled patient completes or discontinues participation in the
             study, another patient from the same household may be screened).

          -  The patient has a disease/condition that, in the medical judgment of the
             investigator, would put the safety of the patient at risk through participation or
             that could affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition worsened
             during the study.
