  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this vital study, the investigators will develop an innovative Opioid Safety (Op-Safe)
      Program for use in pain clinics. The Op-Safe Program consists of two key components:
      Educating patients with an informative brochure and video developed by the Institute for
      Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) Canada, and a screening algorithm to identify unrecognized
      sleep apnea in patients taking opioids for chronic non-cancer pain.

      This 2-year prospective multi-centre cohort study will be conducted at chronic pain clinics
      at Women's College Hospital (WCH), Toronto Western Hospital (TWH), Toronto Rehab Institute
      (TRI), Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) in Toronto, and St. Joseph's Hospital (SJH) in London,
      Ont.

      The primary aim is to develop and evaluate an Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) screening
      algorithm against the results of polysomnography.The research assistants will approach all
      patients visiting chronic pain clinics for eligibility. For recruited patients, a written
      informed consent will be obtained. All recruited patients will undergo polysomnography at
      the Toronto Rehab Institute Sleep Lab or Toronto Sleep and Pulmonary Centre. An overnight
      oximetry by an oximeter will be collected. The sleep physician will review the
      polysomnography results.

      All recruited patients will also complete the STOP-Bang questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale (ESS). The thyromental distance, Mallampati classification, Friedman staging,neck
      circumference and oxygen saturation will be measured. Demographic data, co-morbidities,
      medications and an overnight oximetry will be collected.

      Patients will be assessed on their opioid-related knowledge via the Patient Opioid Education
      Measure (POEM) at the first visit. They will be educated on knowledge of opioids via
      education sheet, pamphlet and video from ISMP-Canada, and then repeat Patient Opioid
      Education Measure (POEM) 6- 8 months later during pain clinic follow up visit.

        All adult patients who are taking opioid medication for &gt;3 months for chronic, non-cancer

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All adult patients (â‰¥18 years old) with cognitive capability to comprehend the
             educational intervention who are taking opioid medication for &gt;3 months for
             non-cancer pain.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with chronic pain secondary to a neoplasm or metastasis as goals of care are
             different in this patient population.

          2. Patients requiring urgent sleep physician referral (within four weeks) due to serious
             medical conditions or safety critical-occupations according to the 2011 Canadian
             Thoracic Society (CTS) guidelines[60] e.g. unstable ischemic heart disease, recent
             cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, refractory systemic hypertension,
             pulmonary hypertension, hypercapnic respiratory failure or pregnancy.

          3. Conditions potentially interfering with comprehension and delivery of informed
             consent or the educational intervention, such as neurological or psychiatric
             disorders.

          4. Patients with a prior diagnosis of sleep-related breathing disorder within the last 3
             years with treatment. Patients who may have had sleep studies 3 or more years earlier
             may be included, if they have been lost to follow-up by a sleep physician, are not on
             treatment or are non-compliant
