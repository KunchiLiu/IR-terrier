    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to develop and test aerosol furosemide, as a treatment that
      has the potential to significantly improve symptom management and enhance the quality of
      care for patients with intractable dyspnea.

    <textblock>
      This is the second study in a series of studies investigating the treatment effect of
      aerosolized furosemide on hospitalized patients and outpatients with intractable dyspnea.
      The study will focus on patients who experience intractable dyspnea at rest or with minimal
      activity, e.g., dressing, bathing, cooking, or walking stairs or short distances.

      There are two parts to this study: Study 2a is a pilot study on 5-10 patients. These trials
      are not blinded or placebo controlled; the investigators will use them to discover practical
      problems, and take the information back to the laboratory to develop solutions.

      Study 2b will a randomized, placebo - controlled, double- blind study on 25 - 40 patients.
      The two planned treatments will be aerosolized furosemide and aerosolized saline, and will
      be given to each patient on two separate days.

    <measure>Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile - composite questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10-20 minutes prior to and following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will fill out Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile, a composite questionnaire which has the subject rate their breathing discomfort (dyspnea) using a visual analog scale. The questionnaire will also ask the subjects to choose physical descriptors of their breathing discomfort, and rate those descriptions using visual analog scales. Lastly, the subjects will rate emotions they might have been feeling while they are short of breath using a visual analog scale.</description>

    <measure>Urine output - mL</measure>
    <time_frame>Repeated measures for 2 hours after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Diuresis is an expected effect of furosemide. To the extent that aerosol furosemide is absorbed in the blood, diuresis is an expected 'side effect' of this treatment.
Following intervention, study team will measure urine output (mL). Study team will then rehydrate subject with an equal amount of liquid to their output.</description>
