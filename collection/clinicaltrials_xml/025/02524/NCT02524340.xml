    <textblock>
      The best treatment plan for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is often complicated.
      Patients and clinicians often don't know what is the best treatment strategy for a given
      patient at a given time. The purpose of this study is to develop a method to analyze data in
      situations where the treatment and disease state change over time. The researchers will
      develop a web-based package that will use the methods developed in this study. The package
      will be easy to use and allow dissemination of the methods to the public.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During routine clinical care, patients and physicians are often confronted with the
      following questions: &quot;Given my (my child's) responses to the previous treatments, what is
      the best treatment option for me (my child)?&quot; (by a patient/parent) and &quot;What treatment
      should we recommend to patients who fail to respond to the first (or second) line of
      treatment?&quot; (by a physician). Both questions are at the heart of patient centered outcomes
      research and clinical care, yet answers to these questions are seriously hindered by the
      lack of adequate analytic methods that appropriately take into account the fact that
      treatments, as well as the determinants of a treatment decision, vary over time during the
      course of the disease. Case in point: despite many medication options, polyarticular
      Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA) is often refractory, and requires better adaptive
      treatment strategies (ATS). Three ATS were recommended by a panel of experts for pJIA
      patients, but they need adequate analysis methods to evaluate and identify better ATS using
      observational data. Motivated by our patient-centered questions, and rigorously designed to
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness of patient centered adaptive treatment strategies
      (PCATS), the proposed method development will directly address: &quot;development and
      dissemination of methods for adequate analysis of data in cases where the treatment/exposure
      varies over time&quot;, an area of interest identified by PCORI.

      Accomplishing the proposed study will provide much needed double robust Bayesian causal
      inference methods that take the challenges of analyzing large registry and electronic health
      records including model uncertainty, large dimensional covariates and the unmeasured
      confounders, into account. A web-based userfriendly analytic computational package will be
      developed to allow easy application of the proposed methods. These developments will: 1)
      immediately offer methods and computational tools for evaluating clinical effectiveness and
      informing optimal ATS, 2) in the near future, enable shared-decision making tools for
      identifying optimal PCATS at the point-of-care, and 3) eventually enable a rapid learning
      system that will facilitate optimal PCATS. This study will have an immediate impact to
      children and stakeholders of JIA and a long-term broad impact to many chronically ill
      patients. Successful completion of this project will significantly move PCORI closer to its
      mission of helping &quot;people make better informed healthcare decisions and improve healthcare
      delivery and outcomes&quot;.
