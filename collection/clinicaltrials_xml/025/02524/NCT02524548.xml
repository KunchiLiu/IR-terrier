      The purpose of this study is to determine whether weekly SMS reminders are effective in
      improving medication adherence of adjuvant aromatase inhibitors in women with breast cancer.

      This study is a prospective randomised controlled parallel trial of SMS reminder versus
      standard care to investigate whether SMS reminder improves adherence to oral aromatase
      inhibitor (AI) therapy amongst women with breast cancer at 1-year follow-up.

      All subjects will be randomised to receive either SMS reminder or standard care in a 1:1
      ratio. Balanced permuted block randomisation will be implemented with random varying of
      block sizes of 4 or 6.

      The sample size is estimated based on the primary endpoint of medication adherence (as
      measured via SMAQ) at 1-year. Assuming that the proportion of medication adherence in the
      intervention and control groups are 80% and 60% respectively, then based on a 5%
      significance level and a power of 90%, a minimum sample of 240 subjects (i.e. 120 per group)
      will be required. Further assuming an attrition rate of 10%, the anticipated trial size is
      280 overall.

      The assessment of medication adherence at 1-year (as measured via SMAQ) between the SMS
      reminder and control groups will be made using chi-square test, with treatment effect
      quantified using the odds ratio estimate and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Adjustment
      for potential confounders will be made using the logistic regression where appropriate.

      Other measures of adherence such as the 1-year medication possession ratio (MPR), proportion
      of days covered (PDC), and pill count will be compared between treatment arms via the t-
      test, with adjustment for confounders made via the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

      The assessment of multiple dependent secondary outcome variables involving estrone,
      estradiol and androstenedione levels will be made using the multivariate analysis of
      variance (MANOVA). The treatment effect will be quantified based on mean differences in
      hormone levels between groups and its 95% CI, adjusted for the respective baseline levels.

      The assessment of knowledge, attitude, behavior, as well as barrier and facilitating factors
      between the intervention and control groups will be made using chi-square test, with
      treatment effect quantified based on odds ratio estimate and its 95% CI. Further adjustment
      for baseline scores and other potential confounders will be made using the logistic
      regression where appropriate.

      Additionally, the investigators will compare the 4 different measures of adherence in a
      separate paper, to determine which of these provide a more meaningful or reliable
      information in the local context based on sensitivity analysis.

      All analyses will be performed according to intention-to-treat using STATA, assuming a
      two-sided test at the 5% level of significance.
