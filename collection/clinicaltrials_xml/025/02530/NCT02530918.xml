  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test DS-7080a, a monoclonal antibody, as a new treatment for
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The hypothesis of the study is that
      DS-7080a is safe and shows preliminary efficacy in patients with neovascular AMD either
      alone or in combination with ranibizumab. This study is organized into 2 parts: Part 1 Dose
      Escalation and Part 2 Dose Expansion. In Part 1, subjects will be enrolled into 3
      sequential, ascending dose-level cohorts in non-randomized uncontrolled manner. In Part 2,
      subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms of either monotherapy with DS-7080a or
      monotherapy with ranibizumab, which is an active control, or combination therapy of DS-7080a
      plus ranibizumab (ranibizumab will be administered 30 minutes prior to DS-7080a).
