      The purpose of this study is to determine whether embryo mechanical properties measured
      after in vitro fertilization can predict clinical pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the current practice of in vitro fertilization (IVF), clinicians often transfer multiple
      embryos to the patient at once in an effort to maximize chances of pregnancy. This practice
      results in a high rate of multiple births which increase the risks of complications for
      mothers and children.

      The investigators in this study have developed a novel, noninvasive marker of embryo
      viability which is based on measuring embryo mechanical properties at the 1-cell stage. The
      investigators would like to test whether human embryo mechanical properties are predictive
      of clinical pregnancy, and compare their predictive power to that of a morphological
      assessment (the current gold standard). Using this approach, clinicians could more
      confidently move toward single embryo transfer as well as improve pregnancy rates after IVF.

      This is a pilot observational study. Although investigators will measure the mechanical
      properties of all participant embryos, no prediction of embryo viability will be made, and
      there will be no intervention in choosing which embryos to transfer to participants. The
      data from this study will eventually be used to find a range of embryo mechanical parameters
      which are predictive of high developmental potential, and will serve as the basis for an
      interventional study in the future.

    <description>This group contains embryos which have their mechanical properties (elasticity and viscosity) measured within 24 hours after fertilization. The investigators are calling this mechanical measurement the &quot;EmbryoHug.&quot; All participants in the study will have their embryos in this group. Outcomes will be evaluated after 5 days, at the time of pregnancy test, at 5-6 weeks, and at 8-10 weeks, and correlated with EmbryoHug parameters.</description>

    <intervention_name>EmbryoHug</intervention_name>
    <description>An embryo will be gently held by a micropipette, and a small inward pressure will be applied to the edge of the embryo. The response of the embryo to this pulling force will allow the investigators to measure its stiffness and viscosity. The term &quot;micropipette aspiration&quot; refers to the pressure applied to the edge of the embryo -- this procedure is not invasive and does not involve any sort of puncture or removal of material from the embryo.</description>
