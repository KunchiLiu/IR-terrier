      The CORRONA Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis Registry is designed to create a
      national cohort of Spondyloarthritis patients cared for by rheumatologists to better
      understand the epidemiology and natural history of the disease, comorbidities, current
      treatment practices, response to therapy and outcomes related to medication therapy.

    <textblock>
      The epidemiology of SpA is less certain than that of RA, partly related to a lack of
      understanding in the general medical community of the varied clinical presentations of the
      various SpA subsets, as well as evolving criteria for disease classification. A recent
      estimate of the prevalence of all forms of SpA in the US is between 0.3 and 1.3% of the
      general population.1 A more recent NHANES study suggests though a potentially higher
      prevalence with up to 1.4% having axial spondyloarthritis. 2 Given that the high estimate
      for axial SpA of 1.4% could even be an underestimate and given the known prolonged delay of
      diagnosis and misdiagnosis, it is all the more important to learn about the disease and its
      management via registry data in order to educate potential stakeholders. Data from the SPARK
      survey, conducted by Abbott in rheumatology practices in North America and Europe, suggested
      that SpA represents 40% of inflammatory arthritis managed in surveyed rheumatology practices
      in the US. Of these patients, 36% had PsA, 23% AS, 18% &quot;Undifferentiated SpA&quot;, and 12% each
      Reactive and Inflammatory Bowel-Related SpA.3 It is likely that those patients classified as
      &quot;undifferentiated&quot; will be classified as either &quot;axialSpA&quot; or &quot;peripheral SpA&quot; by the new
      ASAS criteria for these conditions.4,5

      There is a significant unmet need to develop clinical registry data on the presentation,
      natural history, management, and outcomes of SpA. There is no large clinical registry of SpA
      patients seen in general rheumatology practices. It is anticipated that CORRONA's registry
      will supplement information gathered in other programs and potentially represent a more
      general rheumatology spectrum of SpA patients representative of the general population.

      Corrona's objective is to create a national cohort of Spondyloarthritis patients cared for
      by rheumatologists to better understand the epidemiology and natural history of the disease,
      comorbidities, current treatment practices, response to therapy and outcomes related to
      medication therapy.

      The primary goal of the registry is to systematically collect and analyze longitudinal
      outcomes associated with spondyloarthritis. This includes assessing baseline
      characteristics, and trends in patient characteristics and treatment patterns. Corrona will
      evaluate prevalence rates of comorbidities and the burden of disease in the population.

      The registry is designed as a prospective, multicenter, observational registry for patients
      with spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis. It will obtain longitudinal follow-up
      information via data collected from both patients and their treating rheumatologists every 6
      months. The registry will gather data on disease duration, prognosis, disease severity and
      activity, medical comorbidities, surgeries, hospitalizations, use of medications and
      laboratory and imaging data.

      After the enrollment visit, SpA patients and physicians will complete follow-up
      questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical encounters. The goal is to collect data
      from patients and providers at six month intervals, not to exceed 2 visits in any 12 month
      period.

      Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or be discovered as a result
      of general questioning by the Principal Investigator. During all CORRONA related visits with
      the Principal Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse
      events.

        Patients are enrolled in the Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis Registry during
        regularly-scheduled office visits. Selected rheumatologists are invited to participate as
        investigators in the Registry. Physicians are selected carefully in an effort to ensure
        enrollment of subjects that represent a reasonable representation of a cross-section of
        the population throughout the country with rheumatic diseases. All potential sites are
        screened for clinical research experience and adherence to GCP (Good Clinical Practice)
        guidelines.

             Modified New York Criteria for Ankylosing Spondylitis, the 2009 ASAS Criteria for
             Azial Spondyloarthritis, the 2010 ASAS Criteria for Peripheral Arthritis or the
             CASPAR for psoriatic arthritis. Patients with other forms of overlapping
             non-autoimmune arthritis, such as osteoarthritis or gout, will be allowed, but will
             have these forms of arthritis clearly distinguished from their SpA manifestations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged less than 18 at the time of enrollment into the registry.

          -  Patients unable or unwilling to consent to participation in the registry.

          -  Patients with RA, SLE, or other forms of autoimmune inflammatory arthritis.
