      To investigate the risk of major bleeding (including gastrointestinal and intracranial
      bleeding episodes) among new users of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in clinical
      practice

      These will be based on population-based cohorts using data from a primary care database in
      the UK: The Health Improvement Network (THIN) and will serve to make a clinically meaningful
      benefit-risk assessment regarding major bleeding consequences of ASA exposure in general
      population.

        THIN is a computerized medical research database that contains systematically recorded
        data on more than 3 million UK primary care patients. It is representative of this
        population with regard to age, sex, and geographic distribution, and has been validated
        for use in pharmacoepidemiological and epidemiological research in multiple studies 13.
        Participating Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) record prospectively data as part of their
        routine patient care, including demographics and life style factors (e.g. alcohol use,
        body mass index (BMI) and smoking status), consultation rates, referrals, hospital
        admissions, laboratory test results, diagnoses, prescriptions ordered by the PCPs, and a
        free text section, and send their data anonymously to THIN for use in research projects.
