    <textblock>
      Recent data suggests that melatonin, a supplement available over the counter, may help
      prevent delirium in hospitalized patients. The investigators are hypothesizing that
      melatonin may help in delirium prevention by improving sleep quality and possibly circadian
      rhythm cycling in patients who are given the supplement. This pilot study involves a
      randomized placebo-controlled design in which participants will be randomized to receive
      either melatonin 3mg orally or placebo orally. Participants in both groups will be fitted
      with wireless actigraphy devices to obtain objective sleep quality, and will also receive a
      sleep questionnaire each morning to obtain subjective data on their sleep quality overnight.
      Delirium will be assessed by floor nurses twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method
      (CAM).

    <measure>Delirium as measured by CAM Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Delirium assessments will be made twice daily (am and pm measurements) throughout the course of the patient's admission, or to the end of a 2 week period of enrollment - whichever comes first.</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome is whether patients become delirious, as measured by CAM during their hospital admission.</description>

    <time_frame>nightly, throughout the course of the patient's admission, or to the end of a 2 week period of enrollment - whichever comes first.</time_frame>
    <description>Nocturnal sleep duration will be measured by wireless actigraphy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective sleep quality, measured by number of nighttime wakenings</measure>
    <time_frame>nightly, throughout the course of the patient's admission, or to the end of a 2 week period of enrollment - whichever comes first.</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the number of nighttime wakenings using wireless actigraphy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective sleep quality, measured by sleep latency</measure>
    <time_frame>nightly, throughout the course of the patient's admission, or to the end of a 2 week period of enrollment - whichever comes first.</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure sleep latency (time to fall asleep) using wireless actigraphy.</description>

    <time_frame>once daily, throughout the course of the patient's admission, or to the end of a 2 week period of enrollment - whichever comes first.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to fill out the Richards-Campbell sleep question, which uses a visual analog scale for 5 questions that are designed to assess a patient's perceived sleep quality.</description>
