  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypospadias is one of the most common congenital malformations of the genitalia in boys, and
      is typically managed by surgical intervention. During pediatric urological surgery, caudal
      anesthesia is one of the most common regional anesthetic techniques used. Also known as
      caudal block, it has been shown to be a safe and effective anesthetic technique in children
      with a low incidence of anesthesia-related complications.While the reported incidence of
      complications directly associated with caudal block is low, there is scarce and inconclusive
      evidence on the impact of caudal anesthesia on the incidence of surgical complications. As a
      result, the objective of this superiority, randomized controlled trial is to assess whether
      the use of caudal anesthesia, when compared to dorsal penile block, is associated with a
      higher rate of urethrocutaneous fistulas and glans dehiscence post hypospadias repair.
