  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for cancer or blood disorders
      frequently develop gastrointestinal, metabolic and infectious complications related to
      preparative high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation-related toxicity. Parenteral nutrition
      (PN) with lipid emulsion is commonly required while gastrointestinal complications preclude
      adequate oral or enteral intake. PN and lipids may increase the risk of metabolic and
      infectious complications in HCT patients who are inherently immune compromised.

      Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has been linked to improvements in outcomes in
      several populations. Provision of fish oil lipid emulsion (FOLE), rich in omega-3 fatty
      acids, to children undergoing HCT is an innovative nutritional strategy that could mitigate
      the metabolic and inflammatory side effects of HCT and its treatment. With its potential to
      safely maintain essential fatty acid status, normalize blood lipids and alleviate the
      inflammatory response to illness, the use of FOLE may reduce the risk of infections,
      regimen-related toxicity, and other morbidities after HCT.

      A randomized, controlled pilot study is proposed to test the safety and tolerability of
      FOLE, compared to standard lipid emulsion, in 20 children during hospitalization for HCT.
      Results of this study will provide the preliminary data needed for a larger clinical trial
      examining the effect of FOLE on important clinical outcomes in this population. This novel
      approach to nutritional care of this high-risk group will advance clinical knowledge of the
      impact of FOLE, and will support further investigation into nutritional adjuncts to
      pediatric cancer treatment.
