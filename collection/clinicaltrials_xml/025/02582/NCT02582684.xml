  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if the combination of two anti-HIV medicines, dolutegravir
      (DTG, Tivicay) and lamivudine (3TC, Epivir) taken once a day, will provide a safe,
      effective, and well-tolerated treatment for HIV. DTG is a type of HIV medicine called an
      integrase inhibitor; 3TC is a type of HIV medicine called a reverse transcriptase inhibitor.
      DTG works by blocking integrase and 3TC works by blocking reverse transcriptase, two HIV
      proteins (enzymes). This prevents HIV from multiplying and lowers the viral load (amount of
      HIV in the blood). Both DTG and 3TC are currently part of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      recommended regimens along with a third active drug. Since some HIV medicines have side
      effects and are costly, there is interest in whether HIV can be successfully controlled with
      fewer than three HIV drugs.

    <description>Participants are evaluated for virologic failure regardless of whether on study treatment.
Confirmation will be determined based on any two consecutive evaluations meeting the virologic failure definition regardless of the time between them.
Participants discontinuing the study (for any reason, including death and lost to follow-up) will be considered a virologic failure if their last measurement meets the definition of virologic failure but no confirmatory measurement was obtained. All other participants' follow-up will be censored immediately after the last available plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit, which is required for all IND
        studies.

        WHO and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that
        confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one
        used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by
        either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen
        preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a
        Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL and &lt;500,000 copies/mL obtained within 90 days prior
             to study entry using any FDA-approved assay by any US laboratory that has a CLIA
             certification or its equivalent.

          -  No evidence of any RT, any integrase, or major protease resistance mutation
             (according to the 2014 IAS-USA drug resistance mutations list, available at
             https://www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/22-3-642.pdf) based on pre-ARV
             treatment genotype performed any time prior to study entry.

        NOTE: Integrase genotyping must be performed at screening and is provided by the study. RT
        and PR genotyping should be performed at screening as part of routine clinical care if not
        previously performed.

          -  ARV treatment drug-naive (defined as no previous ARV treatment at any time prior to
             study entry, with the exception of successful post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or
             pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

        NOTE: Participants who were diagnosed with HIV while on PrEP or within a year of PrEP
        (unless documented seronegative in the interim) are not eligible.

          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to study entry by any
             US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent:

               -  ANC ≥750/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥10.0 g/dL

               -  Platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥50 mL/min, as estimated by the
                  Cockcroft-Gault equation

               -  AST &lt;5 x ULN (upper limit of normal)

               -  ALT &lt;5x ULN

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen negative within 45 days prior to study entry performed by
             a CLIA-certified laboratory.

          -  For women with reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test at
             screening and within 48 hours prior to study entry (by any US clinic or laboratory
             that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or is using a point of care
             (POC)/CLIA-waived test). Reproductive potential is defined as women who have not been
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., who have had menses within
             the preceding 24 months, or have not undergone surgical sterilization (e.g.,
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy, tubal ligation or tubal
             micro-inserts). The urine test must have a sensitivity of ≤50 mIU/mL.

        NOTE: Women who report 12 months of amenorrhea and have a follicle-stimulating hormone
        (FSH) level in the menopausal range should be considered as NOT having reproductive
        potential.

          -  If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, female participants
             with reproductive potential must use one form of contraceptive as listed below while
             receiving protocol-specified medications and for 30 days after stopping the
             medications. At least one of the following methods must be used appropriately:

               1. Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent. Condoms are
                  recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method
                  effective for preventing HIV transmission.

                  NOTE: In the setting of condom failure, emergency contraception (plan B) is an
                  appropriate backup method of contraception.

               2. Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide.

               3. Intrauterine device.

               4. Hormone-based contraceptive.

          -  Ability and willingness of participant or legal representative to provide informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization NOTE: Participant
             is eligible if the participant completes therapy 7 days prior to study entry or is
             clinically stable on therapy in the opinion of the site investigator for 7 days prior
             to study entry.

        NOTE: Participants with oral candidiasis, vaginal candidiasis, mucocutaneous herpes
        simplex, and other minor illnesses (as judged by the site investigator) are eligible.

          -  Treatment within 30 days prior to study entry with immune modulators such as systemic
             steroids, interleukins, interferons, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),
             erythropoietin, or any investigational therapy.

        NOTE: Participants receiving stable physiologic glucocorticoid doses (defined as
        prednisone ≤15 mg/day or equivalent as a stable or tapering dose) are eligible.
        Participants receiving corticosteroids for acute therapy for PCP or asthma exacerbation,
        or receiving a short course (defined as ≤2 weeks of pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy)
        are eligible.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding.

          -  The following are prohibited while the participant is on study drugs:

               -  Systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy NOTE: Topical 5FU and treatments for human
                  papilloma virus disease are allowed.

               -  Dofetilide is prohibited with DTG as DTG may inhibit its renal tubular secretion
                  resulting in increased dofetilide concentrations and potential for toxicity.

               -  There are no prohibited medications with 3TC

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity to any of the study drugs or their formulations.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that may interfere with adherence to study
             requirements, in the opinion of the site investigator.

          -  Active hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment or anticipated need for treatment within
             study period.

        NOTE: HCV infection alone is not exclusionary.

          -  Unstable liver disease (as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or persistent
             jaundice), known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  Severe hepatic impairment (Class C) as determined by Child-Pugh classification.
