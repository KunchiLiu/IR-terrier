  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two arms parallel cluster-randomized trial will evaluate the impact of monitoring
      surgical outcomes using Shewhart control chart (intervention) on the occurence of major
      adverse events, among a large sample of French surgical departments. Trends in surgical
      outcomes before and after the intervention will be compared between arms.
