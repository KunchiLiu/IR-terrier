  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether treatment with JNJ-54861911 slows cognitive
      decline compared with placebo treatment, as measured by a composite cognitive measure, the
      Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC), in amyloid-positive participants who are
      asymptomatic at risk for developing Alzheimer's dementia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the researchers
      nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), multi-center (more
      than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study),
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in participants who are asymptomatic and at risk
      for developing Alzheimer's dementia. The study will consist of a Screening Phase
      (approximately 90 days), treatment Phase (54 months) and follow-up Phase (7 to 28 days). In
      treatment Phase eligible Participants will be randomized to receive study drug or placebo
      once daily for up to 4.5 years. The maximum study duration for a participant will be 58
      months. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) to Month 54</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 54</time_frame>
    <description>The PACC is composed of 4 measures [Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Delayed Paragraph Recall, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-IV Coding and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Total Score] that are weighted towards episodic memory and includes a timed executive function test and a global cognitive screening test. Each component score will be transformed into z scores. These z-scores will then be summed to form the composite. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Cognitive Function Index (CFI) to Month 54</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 54</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive Function Index (CFI) is a 15 point rating scale that assess the Participants perceived ability to perform high-level functional tasks in daily-life and sense of overall cognitive functional ability. The higher scores indicates greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living - Prevention Instrument (ADCS-ADLPI) Total Score to Month 54</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 54</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living - Prevention Instrument (ADCS-ADLPI) is a questionnaire related to activities of daily living and to physical functioning. The scores range from 0 to 45 with higher scores indicating less impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Total Scale Score to Month 51</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 51</time_frame>
    <description>The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) rating scale is used to assess the cognitive assessment, detection, and characterization of dementia. The scores range from 40 to 160, and are normalized to a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. Higher scores indicating less impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score to Month 54</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 54</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores ranging from 0 to 18. The CDR assesses 3 domains of cognition (memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving) and 3 domains of function (community affairs, home/hobbies, personal care) using semistructured interviews of both the study participant and an informant carried out by a trained rater. The Higher CDR-SB scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

Index scores can range from less than or equal to (&lt; =) 55 to greater than or equal to (&gt; =) 145, and are normalized to a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
