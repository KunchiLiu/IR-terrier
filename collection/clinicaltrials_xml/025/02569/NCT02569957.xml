    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the effects of acetylcysteine and topotecan
      hydrochloride on the tumor microenvironment, or cells that make up a tumor, compared to
      topotecan hydrochloride alone in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer that has not responded to treatment (persistent) or has returned after a
      period of improvement (recurrent) and is high grade (likely to grow and spread quickly).
      Research has shown that cancer cells may be able to convert nearby normal cells into cancer
      cells. Acetylcysteine may stop this from happening. Topotecan hydrochloride is a
      chemotherapy drug used to treat ovarian cancer, and may help acetylcysteine work better.
      This trial studies the effect of acetylcysteine and topotecan hydrochloride on the tumor
      microenvironment to see if they can help make it more difficult for tumor cells to grow.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of subjects with persistent or recurrent high grade
      endometrioid or serous ovarian carcinoma who demonstrate a downregulation of monocarboxylate
      transporter 4 (MCT4) in the ovarian stroma in response to exposure to topotecan (topotecan
      hydrochloride) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (acetylcysteine) as compared to topotecan alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the expression levels of caveolin 1 (Cav-1), solute carrier family 16
      (monocarboxylate transporter), member 1 (MCT1), translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane
      20 homolog (yeast) (TOMM20), fatty acid binding protein 4, adipocyte (FABP4), hypoxia
      inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (HIF-1 alpha) and NF kappaB activating protein (NFκB) in
      pathological samples of tumors after therapy with NAC relative to samples taken at time of
      initial diagnosis.

      II. To assess the potential impact of NAC on progression free survival, overall survival,
      objective tumor response- complete or partial, and duration of response.

      III. To estimate the proportion of subjects who survive progression free for at least 6
      months and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response, complete or partial
      in response to therapy IV. To assess safety and tolerability of NAC plus topotecan treatment
      in subjects with endometrioid or serous ovarian carcinoma by Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0 criteria.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15 (+/- 1 day window for each treatment day). Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride as in Arm I. Patients also receive
      acetylcysteine IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (+/- 1 day window for each
      treatment day) and acetylcysteine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 2-7, 9-14, 16-21,
      and 23-28, unless administration window was utilized. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must have persistent or recurrent high grade endometrioid or serous ovarian,
             primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma. Histologic documentation of the
             original primary tumor is required via the pathology report.

          2. All patients must have measurable disease that is amenable to biopsy. Measurable
             disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least
             one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be ≥20 mm when
             measured by conventional techniques including palpation, plain film x-ray, CT, and
             MRI, or ≥ 10 mm when measured by high resolution CT.

          3. Patient must have at least one target lesion to be used to assess response on this
             protocol as defined by RECIST 1.1. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will
             be designated as non-target lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is
             obtained to confirm persistent disease at least 90 days following completion of
             radiation therapy.

          4. Patients must have a GOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          7. Any other prior therapy directed at the tumor, including immunologic agents, must be
             discontinued at least 3 weeks prior to initiation of therapy.

          8. Patients must have had at least one prior platinum/taxane combination
             chemotherapeutic regimen for management of primary disease containing carboplatin,
             cisplatin, or another organoplatin compound. This initial treatment may include
             intraperitoneal therapy, high dose therapy, consolidation, noncytotoxic agents, or
             extended therapy.

          9. Patients must be platinum resistant- defined as progressive disease while receiving
             platinum therapy or within 6 months of completing first line platinum therapy or
             patients who have progressive disease after two lines of platinum based treatment.

               1. Cytotoxic regimens are any that include agents that target the genetic and/or
                  mitotic apparatus of the dividing cells, resulting in dose limiting toxicity to
                  the bone marrow or gastrointestinal mucosa

               2. Patients are allowed to receive, but not required to receive biologic

               2. Renal Function: creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal,
                  CTCAE v 4.0 grade 1.

               3. Hepatic Function: bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal,
                  CTCAE v 4.0 grade 1. Asparate transaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase less

                  CTCAE v 4.0 grade 1 except for patients on therapeutic anticoagulation.

               5. Neurologic Function: neuropathy (sensory and motor) less than or equal to CTCAE
                  v 4.0 grade 1.

             patients must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to
             initiating protocol therapy and be practicing an effective form of contraception
             during protocol therapy and for at least 4 weeks following completion of protocol
             therapy.

         14. Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

             evidence of other malignancy being present within the last 3 years.

          5. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor other
             than for treatment of ovarian carcinoma within the last 3 years are excluded.
             Patients may have received prior chemotherapy for localized breast cancer, provided
             that it was completed more than three years prior to registration and the patient
             remains free of recurrent of metastatic disease.
