      This study of the tolerance and acceptability of an amino acid based feed will assess
      gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance, product intake and acceptability in relation to taste,
      smell, texture in 20 patients between 1-10 years currently using or requiring an amino acid
      based feed for the dietary management of Cows' Milk Allergy and food-allergy-associated
      conditions, over 4 weeks.

    <description>Each child will receive the amino acid based feed for a period of up to 4 weeks (28 days). The feed prescription will be determined on an individual basis by the Dietitian responsible for the child's nutritional management. The child will take the feed orally or via a pre-existing naso-gastric, gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube.</description>
