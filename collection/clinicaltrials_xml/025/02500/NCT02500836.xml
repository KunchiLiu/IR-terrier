      Eligible subjects will undergo either an office-based or operating room-based procedure or
      surgery. The approximately 620 subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 fashion to one of the
      three treatment groups (248 subjects randomized to the Cocaine HCl 4% solution, 248 subjects
      randomized to the Cocaine HCl 10%, and 124 subjects randomized to the placebo solution)
      pre-procedure and given one application of the assigned test product with Von Frey filament
      testing occurring after application.

    <time_frame>One Day, Single office based diagnostic procedure or surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for this trial is anesthesia success immediately after application of study drug and sustained throughout the diagnostic procedure or surgery. A subject will be considered a treatment success if they meet the following for each nostril that received study drug application: Prior to the diagnostic procedure or surgery, based on the Von Frey filament challenge after application of the assigned study drug solution (Cocaine HCl 4% Topical Solution or Cocaine HCl 10% Topical Solution or Placebo Topical Solution), the subject response is a 0 (zero) pain score on the 10 point pain scale (0 = no pain, 10 = unbearable pain) compared to the Von Frey filament test right before study drug application. And,during the diagnostic procedure or surgery, no further analgesic treatment is required (only 4% and 10% Cocaine HCl subjects who receive a diagnostic procedure or surgery). Otherwise, the subject will be considered a treatment failure.</description>

             on or through the nasal mucous membranes which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would compromise the safety of the subject, the quality of the data, or the normal
             wound healing process.

          -  Use of any analgesic 2 days prior to screening or has a need to use these drugs
             during the screening period. This includes NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, diclofenac,

             codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, aspirin, or acetaminophen.

          -  Subjects who have experienced a seizure while taking isoniazid (INH), phenothiazines,
             chlorpromazine, thioridazine, theophylline, or tricyclic antidepressants such as
             amitriptyline.

          -  Has previously received study drug during this study. Subjects who fail screening may
             rescreen if eligibility requirements are met, but only if the subject has not
             received any study drug during this study.

          -  Has a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, congestive heart
             failure, irregular heart rhythm (as fully defined in sections 7.9.4, 7.9.5 and 7.9.6)
             or uncontrolled hypertension or is taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (6).
             Uncontrolled hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal
             to 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg (43)(44).

          -  Has a known personal or family history of hereditary pseudocholinesterase deficiency.
             (2) Study participants will be screened by asking about personal or family history of

             deficiency in a relative or personally. Subjects identified with pseudocholinesterase
             deficiency are at risk for delayed recovery with certain anesthetics (e.g.
             succinylcholine and ester-based anesthetics). (14)

          -  Has a known personal or family history of pheochromocytoma. (2) Study participants
             will be specifically asked if they have been treated for a pheochromocytoma
             previously or if they have a family member who has been diagnosed with
             pheochromocytoma (since 10% of these are familial). (14)

          -  Has a known personal or family history of an adrenal tumor.

          -  Use of amphetamines in the 2 days prior to screening or has a need to use these drugs

             products such as catecholamines (norepinephrine or epinephrine), ephedrine,
             pseudoephedrine and any other amphetamines in the 48 hours prior to screening or has
             a need to use these drugs during the course of the study. All herbal products except
             coffee, tea, or herbal tea are also prohibited within 48 hours prior to screening or
             if the subject has a need to use these drugs during the course of the study. Coffee,
             Tea, and Herbal Tea are not exclusionary criteria or prohibited medications as they
             are food products not prescription or nonprescription products.

          -  Has screening 12-lead ECG findings of any abnormalities as listed in section 7.9.4,
             7.9.5, and 7.9.6. Generally, these are current or prior myocardial ischemia or
             infarction, dysrhythmia, or risk of serious dysrhythmia (such as prolonged QT
             interval) and include any other clinically significant abnormal ECG finding that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor, may
             potentially result in this trial being unsafe for the subject.

          -  An exception to this would be 7.9.5.11 (resting sinus bradycardia or resting sinus
             tachycardia to a limit of 110 beats per minute) as these represent normal variants
             that may be found in younger or older healthy adults. (36)

          -  Cardiac enzymes above the range of normal

          -  Coagulation studies that in the opinion of the investigator would be cause for the
             subject to be excluded from the study.

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test at screening or Day 1

          -  Positive urine drug test at screening or Day 1 without prior medically-necessary use
             of controlled substances (for example, benzodiazepines for anxiety)

          -  Subjects is a member of the Investigational Team, including Investigators or
             Sub-Investigators, or their immediate family.
