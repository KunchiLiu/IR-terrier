  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of BTCT4465A when
      administered as a single agent by intravenous (IV) infusion to participants with relapsed or
      refractory B-cell NHL and CLL. The study will consist of a dose-escalation stage and an
      expansion stage where participants will be enrolled into indication-specific cohorts.
