    <textblock>
      Due to sustained military conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade, there are
      an increasing number of U.S. military personnel and Veterans returning home with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid alcohol use disorders (AUD). If left
      untreated, Veterans with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders are at increased risk
      for developing other mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety), suicidal ideation
      and attempts, physical health problems, reduced resiliency and military readiness,
      employment problems, violence, and family/relationship impairment. While mental health
      services are in place for U.S. service members, substantial gaps in the treatment of
      co-occurring PTSD and AUD exist and there is little scientific evidence available to guide
      the provision of care. As part of the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD (CAP), the proposed study
      directly addresses this critical knowledge gap by testing the efficacy of doxazosin, a
      long-acting and selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, as compared to placebo in reducing
      PTSD and AUD severity among U.S. military personnel. The most common substance use disorder
      among Veterans is alcohol use disorder (AUD); thus the proposed study targets Veterans with
      co-occurring PTSD and AUD. The medication to be investigated (doxazosin XL) represents a
      novel treatment approach for PTSD/AUD. While prazosin, also an alpha-1 adrenergic
      antagonist, has been shown to improve sleep and nightmares in military personnel with PTSD
      and may help reduce substance use severity, it has a short half-life of 2-3 hours and
      requires multiple doses each day, which is a significant limitation. In several pilot
      studies, doxazosin has shown promise in significantly reducing symptoms of PTSD and AUD and,
      in contrast to prazosin, it requires once per day dosing which confers a significant
      advantage in terms of translating positive findings into routine clinical practice. In this
      Stage II study, the investigators will (1) employ a two-arm randomized, double-blind,
      between-groups experimental design that will consist of 12 weeks of treatment with doxazosin
      XL or placebo medication; (2) use standardized, repeated dependent measures to rigorously
      assess PTSD symptomatology and AUD severity at 5 time points (baseline, week 4, week 8, week
      12 and 6-week follow-up); (3) measure impairment in associated mental and behavioral health
      problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep, risky behaviors, family/social functioning); and
      (4) use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the underlying
      pathophysiology of comorbid PTSD/AUD and identify prognostic indicators of treatment
      outcome. To achieve these aims, the investigators have assembled a multidisciplinary team of
      investigators with nationally-recognized expertise in combat-related PTSD, substance use
      disorders and neuroimaging who have successfully collaborated in the past and are uniquely
      qualified to implement this type of investigation. The investigators represent a
      collaboration of faculty at the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center and
      the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, SC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female; any race or ethnicity; age 21 to 70 years old.

          2. Served in U.S. Military - any branch or operation.

          3. Subjects must be able to comprehend English.

          4. Meet criteria for current (i.e., last 6 months) alcohol use disorder (AUD) using a
             modified version of the MINI 7.0 (i.e., must meet DSM-5 criteria for AUD in the past
             6 months instead of 12 months).

          5. Meet DSM-5 criteria for current (i.e., last month) PTSD.

          6. Enrolled in the VAMC Substance Abuse Treatment Clinic (SATC) program.

          7. Subjects taking psychotropic medications will be required to be maintained on a
             stable dose for at least four weeks before treatment initiation. This is because
             initiation or change of medications during the course of the trial may interfere with
             interpretation of results.

          8. Must consent to random assignment to doxazosin or placebo.

          9. Must consent to complete all treatment and follow-up visits.

         10. Must live within 50 miles (one hour) of the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC in Charleston, SC.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for a history of or current bipolar affective
             disorders, as the study protocol may be therapeutically insufficient.

          2. Subjects experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, as evidence by a score of 10
             or above on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol (CIWA).These
             subject will be referred for clinical detoxification and may be re-assessed for study
             eligibility after medically supervised detoxification has been completed.

          3. Individuals considered an immediate suicide risk or who are likely to require
             hospitalization during the course of the study.

          4. Previous treatment with doxazosin.

          5. Subjects on maintenance anxiolytic, antidepressant, or mood stabilizing medications
             which have been initiated during the past four weeks. If it is determined, based on
             clinical criteria, that a subject needs to be started on maintenance medications for
             anxiety, mood or psychotic symptoms during the course of the study, they will be
             discontinued from the treatment trial.

          6. Women who are pregnant, nursing or not practicing an effective form of birth control.

          7. Individuals with a history of or current medical illness including unstable angina,
             myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or other cardiac condition,

             of SGOT or SGPT greater than two times normal.

          9. Subjects with a history of adverse reactions to quinazolines or other
             alpha-1-antagonists (such as allergic reactions, priapism, hepatitis, angioedema, or
             intraoperative floppy iris syndrome).
