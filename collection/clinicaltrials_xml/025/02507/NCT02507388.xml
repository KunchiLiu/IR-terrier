  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of RTH258 in
      subjects (Japanese and non-Japanese ethnicity) with neovascular Age-Related Macular
      Degeneration (AMD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has 2 arms with a 1:1 randomization. Randomization will be stratified by Japanese
      ethnicity. Half of the subjects in each arm will be of Japanese ethnicity. The other half of
      the subjects in each arm will be non-Japanese. Subjects in both arms will have visits
      through Day 84.
