    <textblock>
      This exploratory study is designed to help develop a clinical model to measure the earlier
      stages of dietary acid medicated enamel loss. The study will use fluoride as positive
      control to explore the validity of this design.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from pre-acid challenge (baseline) tooth impression grading score immediately following an acid challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 minutes post dietary acid challenge</time_frame>
    <description>The impressions of the tooth surface were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate changes in the enamel surface topography to determine degree of early stage enamel erosion. Interrogation of the tooth surface via impressions using SEM followed by visual image analysis was used to investigate the enamel surface topography.
The Images were graded as follows:
- No signs of surface erosive wear (no evidence of the &quot;lock and key&quot; structure)
- Early signs of erosive surface changes
- Mild signs of erosive surface changes (early signs of the &quot;lock and key&quot; structure).
- Moderate signs of erosive surface changes
- Severe signs of erosive surface changes (&quot;lock and key&quot; structure and enamel &quot;pits&quot;) X - Not evaluable</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from pre-acid challenge (baseline) tooth impression grading score following 2, 4, and 7 hours post acid challenge</measure>
