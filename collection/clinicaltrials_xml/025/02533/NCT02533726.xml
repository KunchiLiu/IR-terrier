  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether optimal patient turning, strictly every 2 hours
      with at least 15 minutes of tissue decompression, reduces the occurrence of hospital
      acquired pressure ulcers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single site, open label, two arm randomized control trial aims to evaluate whether
      optimal patient turning, strictly every 2 hours with at least 15 minutes of tissue
      decompression, reduces the occurrence of hospital acquired pressure ulcers. Optimal turning
      procedures will be obtained with the use of a patient monitoring system (Leaf Healthcare,
      Inc.) and compared to standard preventative care practices.
