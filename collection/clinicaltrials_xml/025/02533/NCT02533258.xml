    <textblock>
      This is a post-marketing Surveillance study to observe INLYTA® treatment dosing pattern,
      safety and effectiveness in Taiwan real world routine practice. The primary objective of
      this registry is to monitor the dose adjustment of INLYTA® in real world routine practice.
      The secondary objectives include safety profile, objective response rate, and
      progression-free rate in real world routine practice.

      This is a multi-center chart review registry on mRCC patients treated with axitinib. Primary
      objective is the dose adjustment. Secondary objectives are safety profile, objective
      response rate and progression free survival. Efficacy assessment will be based on
      investigators' judgment. Patients treated with 1st dose of axitinib between May 7, 2013 and
      June 30, 2015 will be enrolled. The follow-up time is 12 months. Prior therapies should
      include sunitinib or interferon alpha.
