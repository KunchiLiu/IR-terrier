  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the real-world safety/effectiveness of Eliquis in Korean venous thromboembolism
      (VTE) patients and patient characteristics that are associated with bleeding among patients
      taking Eliquis. To identify factors that might be associated with the safety and
      effectiveness profile in Korean VTE patients.
