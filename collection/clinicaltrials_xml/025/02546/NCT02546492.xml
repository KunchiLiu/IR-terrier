  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label safety and feasibility trial using Acthar® in addition to the
      investigators center-specific standard therapy, which could include increase in maintenance
      immunosuppression, high dose IVIG (2 g/Kg), and/or Rituximab, in patients with CAMR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive Acthar® 40 units twice a week subcutaneously for 2 weeks. If the drug
      is well tolerated the dose will be increased to 80 units twice a week for another 22 weeks.
      The patients will be maintained on their center-specific standard maintenance regimen,
      typically consisting of Tacrolimus, mycephenolate mofetil/Sodium, and prednisone.

      After screening for the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the patients will be consented and
      enrolled in the study. The initial visit and subsequent study-related visits at 4, 8, 12,
      24, 36 and 52 weeks will include routine evaluation and physical examination and laboratory
      studies including CBC, electrolyte panel, eGFR, albumin, liver enzymes, and CNI/sirulimus
      drug level, according to the center's standard of care. DSA will be tested at week 24, and
      52 and patients will undergo a biopsy at week 52, as a part of the investigators standard of
      care. The biopsies will be evaluated by light and electron microscopy using standard
      histological Banff criteria, and staining for CD68.
