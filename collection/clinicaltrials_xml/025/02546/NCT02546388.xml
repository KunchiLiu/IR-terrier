  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study to find out if a drug called OctreoScan can help doctors
      diagnose people with cardiac sarcoidosis better.

      OctreoScan is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to diagnose certain
      tumors.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate if patients with clinically suspected cardiac sarcoidosis exhibit a myocardial OctreoScan signal high enough (heart-to-blood pool ratio â‰¥ 2.0) to be visually detected compared to a control group of individuals (expected heart-to-blood pool ratio of ~ 1.0).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early versus delayed imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate whether 4-hour (early) compared to 24-hour (delayed) post-OctreoScan injection imaging yields similar lesion detection performance.</description>

    <description>Patients with biopsy-proven extra-cardiac sarcoidosis, and clinical suspicion of cardiac sarcoidosis, including an abnormal FDG-PET scan, will be recruited to receive an injection of the FDA-approved radiotracer Indium-111 Pentreotide (OctreoScan). The imaging protocol will consist of imaging at 4 and 24 hours after OctreoScan injection.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals aged 18 or older

          -  Documentation of biopsy-proven sarcoidosis in the lungs and/or lymph nodes

          -  Clinical suspicion of cardiac involvement defined as the presence of any of the
             following: high-degree A-V nodal block, complete bundle branch block, reduced left or
             right ventricular systolic function, any cardiac arrhythmia, and/or unexplained chest
             pain, dyspnea or syncope

          -  PET/CT imaging demonstrating abnormal myocardial FDG uptake consistent with active
             inflammatory myocardium.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current use of oral steroids or any other immunosuppressive medication, as they may,
             in theory, suppress OctreoScan uptake in the heart.

          -  Patients with history of neuroendocrine tumors (specially insulinomas)

          -  Patients taking the medication Octreotide

          -  Patients on total parenteral nutrition (TPN)

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
