  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer increases the possibility of
      complete resection and anal sphincter preservation. However, a treatment period of from 5 to
      6 weeks is an obstacle of proper surgical intervention. Also, radiotherapy itself is
      confronting challenges for maximizing the therapeutic effect and minimizing the side
      effects. Electro-hyperthermia is appropriate treatment method to solve these kinds of
      problems. In this clinical trial, therapeutic effect of the high-frequency
      electro-hyperthermia is to be verified during preoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced
      rectal cancer. The ultimate goal is to establish a safe and effective treatment protocol.

      regression to conventional schedule of preoperative radiotherapy.
