    <textblock>
      Investigators will assess the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium in patients
      ≥60 years old undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), with/without valve surgery
      (aortic and/or mitral) based on different regimens for postoperative sedation and analgesia.
      Patients will receive either intravenous (IV) dexmedetomidine and IV acetaminophen or
      standard postoperative management using IV propofol with morphine or hydromorphine. The
      Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) will be used to assess delirium in these patients.
      Investigators also seek to compare overall postoperative analgesic requirements in patients
      with or without IV acetaminophen. Investigators will finally assess postoperative cognition
      in post-surgical patients up to one year post-discharge using a cognitive assessment scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, factorial design
      study consisting of 120 patients. Intravenous dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen will be
      compared to the standard sedation/analgesic propofol and opioid regimen.

      After obtaining informed consent, study subjects will be randomized by an unblinded
      investigator and receive a specific combination of both sedatives and analgesic medications.
      Sedatives will include either IV propofol or IV dexmedetomidine, and analgesics IV
      acetaminophen or placebo (100 mL 0.9% NaCl equivalent to the administered volume of IV
      acetaminophen). Subjects will be allocated in a 1:1:1:1 fashion into the following four
      treatment arms: 1. IV acetaminophen with IV propofol, 2. IV acetaminophen with IV
      dexmedetomidine, 3. IV propofol with placebo, or 4. IV dexmedetomidine with placebo.
      Sedation and analgesia protocols will begin once patients are transferred to the
      Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU). The medications for sedation will be weight
      based (loading infusion of 0.5 - 1 µg/kg given over 10 minutes followed by a maintenance
      infusion of 0.1-1.4 µg/kg/hr for IV dexmedetomidine, or 20-100 µg/kg/min for IV propofol).
      Postoperative sedation is administrated 4-6 hours before patients are woken up in the CVICU.
      IV Acetaminophen (1g or 100mL) will be given every 6 hours for 48 hours to patients
      randomized to this drug. The volume of the placebo will be administered in respective groups
      in the same timeframe. Oral acetaminophen will be continued until discharge in all patients.
      All groups will also receive bolus doses of opioids (IV morphine or hydromorphone) as needed
      for breakthrough pain.

      Patients will be administered a preoperative (baseline) and a series of post-operative
      evaluations to assess delirium by a blinded investigator. Baseline assessments will include
      the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), days of the week (DOW), months of the year (MOY),
      Delirium Symptom Interview (DSI), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Confusion
      Assessment Method (CAM). Daily cognitive assessments will include the DSI, CAM, and a
      standard cognitive assessment. At discharge, the MoCA, DOW, MOY, DSI, and CAM will be given.
      Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 1 month and 1 year post-discharge and will
      include the telephonic MoCA, DSI, GDS and CAM. The delirium research assessments will not be
      provided to the treating clinicians. Treating clinicians will assess and treat delirium as
      usual, including assessment and correction of reversible causes, behavioral management, and
      use of IV haloperidol as needed for agitation. Rescue doses of haloperidol will be recorded
      in the study.

      Blood will be collected from all subjects at the time of the baseline assessment,
      post-operation day 1 (POD1) while in ICU, POD 2 in the ICU, and within 48 hours of
      discharge. Two sets of 10 mL will be collected at each time point, with a total of 80mL of
      blood per patient. Efforts will be made to efficiently draw blood through the patient's
      arterial line at baseline or add onto to scheduled draws with phlebotomy. The plasma and
      buffy coat will be separated from the blood, aliquotted into labeled vials, and stored in a
      biomarker bank at -80°C for future use.
