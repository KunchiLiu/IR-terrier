  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 3 multi-center, open-label extension study is to evaluate the
      long-term safety of ACTIMMUNE® (interferon-γ 1b) in subjects with Friedreich's Ataxia (FA).

    <textblock>
      Subjects who complete 26 weeks of blinded treatment in HZNP-ACT-301, (NCT02415127) will be
      eligible to enter this 6-month study. All subjects who choose to participate will receive
      ACTIMMUNE three times a week (TIW) for 26 weeks. In order to maintain the study blind in
      HZNP-ACT-301, all subjects in this open-label extension study will undergo ACTIMMUNE
      titration, regardless if they received ACTIMMUNE or placebo in HZNP-ACT-301.The Week 26
      Visit from HZNP-ACT-301 will serve as the Baseline Visit (Day 1) for this study. The study
      drug dose is planned to be escalated on a weekly basis over the first 4 weeks of treatment
      (from 10 µg/m2 to 100 µg/m2), however, the dose may be reduced, interrupted, or held based
      on tolerability. During the treatment period, additional clinic visits are scheduled at
      Weeks 4, 13, and 26; in between clinic visits, subjects (and/or caregivers) will be
      monitored via emails/phone calls on a weekly basis until subjects reach their maximum
      tolerated dose and on a monthly basis thereafter.

    <description>Approximately 90 subjects will receive subcutaneous (SC) doses of ACTIMMUNE® three times a week (TIW) for a total of 26 weeks. The study drug dose is planned to be escalated on a weekly basis over the first 4 weeks of treatment (from 10 µg/m² to 25, 50, and 100 µg/m²). The dose may be reduced, interrupted, or held based on tolerability. By week 13, all subjects are to be on a stable tolerated dose of study drug in order to continue study participation; the dose may not be further increased after week 13, however, it may be reduced on a case-by-case basis to manage drug-related AEs.</description>

          -  If female, the subject is not pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant
             during the study, or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Female
             subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result

             of contraception throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study
             drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be ineligible if, in the opinion of the Investigator, they are unlikely
             to comply with the study protocol or have a concomitant disease or condition that
             could interfere with the conduct of the study or potentially put the subject at
             unacceptable risk.
