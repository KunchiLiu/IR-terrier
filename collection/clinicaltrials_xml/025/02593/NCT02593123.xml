      Determine the relapse-free, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)-free survival in patients
      receiving the investigational regimen.This is a randomized phase II clinical trial,
      comparing two different dosing schedules of mycophyenolate mofetil for graft versus host
      disease (GVHD) prevention following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Risk for relapse,
      GVHD and non-relapse mortality will be assessed. Adaptive randomization between two study
      arms will be performed based on T cell counts at day 60.

      In this study, the investigators will utilize a regimen combining low dose total body
      irradiation and rabbit ATG to facilitate stem cell transplantation (SCT) with HLA matched
      related and unrelated donors. Based on the hypothesis that early treatment interventions
      have significant late effects in allogeneic SCT, a simple intervention, varying the duration
      of intense immunosuppression following SCT, will be investigated in this study. This may
      allow more robust recovery of donor immune system cells in the first two months following
      transplantation and eventually result in lower risk of cancer relapse, while maintaining
      effective graft versus host disease (GVHD) control. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive GVHD prevention therapy using one of two different immunosuppressive regimens with
      tacrolimus &amp; mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Patients assigned to the investigational group
      will receive MMF for 15 days following SCT with growth factor support using granulocyte
      macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) beginning on post-transplant day 4. Patients
      randomized to the standard treatment group will receive MMF for 30 days following SCT with
      cytokine support using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) beginning on
      post-transplant day 4. If one of these treatment groups demonstrates an improvement in donor
      immune cell recovery, there may be a slow increase in the likelihood of patients being
      assigned to that more successful treatment group. Eventually the two groups will be compared
      with respect to the likelihood of either relapse or GVHD developing.

          -  Active meningeal or central nervous system disease

          -  Previous therapy with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG); previous treatment with
             equine ATG is allowed if more than 3 months ago

             *Note: Previous myeloablative autologous transplant is permitted but not required.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Medical, psychological, or social condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the patient's risk or limit the patient's adherence with study
