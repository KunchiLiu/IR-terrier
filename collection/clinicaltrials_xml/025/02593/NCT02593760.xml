  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of vismodegib plus (+) ruxolitinib versus placebo + ruxolitinib in
      participants with intermediate- or high-risk MF. The study will be divided into 2
      components. The Phase 1b portion of the study will be started with 6-week safety run-in
      period with 10 participants who will receive vismodegib (150 milligrams [mg] orally [PO]
      once daily [QD]) + ruxolitinib (PO twice daily [BID]) for the assessment of acute safety
      events associated with this combined therapy. After getting confirmation about the safety
      and toxicity of this combination, the Phase 3 randomization portion of the study will begin
      during which approximately 84 participants will randomly assign in 1:1 ratio to receive
      either vismodegib (150 mg PO QD) plus ruxolitinib (PO BID) or placebo (PO QD) plus
      ruxolitinib (PO BID) for up to 48 weeks or until withdrawal or discontinuation, whichever
      occurs first.
