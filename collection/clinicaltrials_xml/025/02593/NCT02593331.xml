  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of BFKB8488A following
      subcutaneous (SC) administration in overweight and obese subjects (body mass index [BMI]
      27-40 kg/m^2) with markers of insulin resistance. Single ascending fixed doses of BFKB8488A
      will be evaluated. Participants will be randomized into 7 sequential ascending fixed-dose
      cohorts of BFKB8488A SC or placebo and safety reviews will be performed before escalation to
      higher dose cohorts.
