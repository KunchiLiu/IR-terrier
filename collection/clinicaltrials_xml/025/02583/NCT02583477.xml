  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib and II open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in combination with
      chemotherapy and novel anticancer agents in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
      (PDAC). This study will consist of 2 independent cohorts.
