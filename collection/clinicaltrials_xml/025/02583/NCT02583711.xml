  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study, which aims to assess how physical activity levels following
      surgical procedures correlate with patient recovery and length of hospital stay, as well as
      the utility of this physical activity data to the postoperative surgical team. Surgical
      teams frequently enquire about their patients' physical activity levels on postoperative
      ward rounds. Although this information is often provided anecdotally by nursing staff and
      junior doctors, there are no objective data made available to the clinician. Such data has
      the potential to supplement other observations (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure,
      temperature) to help gain an impression of a patient's recovery and physical status, this in
      turn could provide evidence to help facilitate early discharge as well as to predict medium
      to longterm outcomes. Advances in wearable technology allow the investigators to collect
      detailed information with regard to activity with minimal disruption.

      Recent literature has shown that these wristworn sensors can feasibly be worn in hospital
      pre and postoperatively, with evidence of a correlation between the amount of steps taken
      postoperatively and the length of hospital stay. This study will provide further evidence
      for the usability and utility of wearable sensors in the inpatient surgical setting. It will
      provide supporting evidence for surgeons to confidently analyse and assess patients in
      hospital, allowing for safe and expedient discharge home as well as identify highrisk
      patients who are likely to require extra support and surveillance in the community setting.
