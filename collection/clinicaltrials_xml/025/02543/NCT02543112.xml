      This is a Long-term Access Programme (LAP) which aims to support provision of mepolizumab,
      until it is commercially available, to eligible subjects with severe asthma who participated
      in a GSK-sponsored mepolizumab clinical study 200862 and 200363. Eligible subjects will
      initiate mepolizumab within a 6-month period following the individual subject's last
      scheduled visit in their preceding clinical study. For each subject benefit versus risk will
      be assessed throughout the study to support continued treatment with mepolizumab.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject participated in GSK-sponsored asthma clinical study with mepolizumab as
             specified in Study 200862 and 200363

          -  Subject has either: completed the treatment period in the mepolizumab asthma clinical
             study to which they were originally enrolled or if the subject was withdrawn from
             study treatment prematurely during the mepolizumab asthma clinical study to which
             they were originally enrolled but the subject has completed the study assessments at
             the study visit that would have been the end of the respective treatment period.

          -  The treating physician requesting mepolizumab under this Long-term Access Programme
             considers the benefits of treatment with mepolizumab outweigh the risks for the
             individual subject.

          -  To be eligible for mepolizumab treatment under this Long-term Access Programme,
             females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must commit to consistent and correct use of
             an acceptable method of birth control, beginning with consent, for the duration of
             the treatment with mepolizumab and for 4 months after the last mepolizumab
             administration.

          -  The subject consents to receiving treatment with mepolizumab under this Long-term
             Access Programme. In the case of a paediatric subject being eligible a
             parent(s)/guardian will give written informed consent prior to the child's
             participation in the study. If applicable, the subject must be able and willing to
             give assent to take part in the study according to the local requirement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A current malignancy or history of cancer in remission for less than 12 months
             (Subjects who had localized carcinoma (i.e., basal or squamous cell) of the skin
             which was resected for cure will not be excluded).

          -  Subject has other clinically significant medical conditions uncontrolled with
             standard-of-care therapy not associated with asthma, e.g., unstable liver disease,
             uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, ongoing active infectious disease requiring
             systemic treatment.

          -  Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Subjects should not be considered for continued
             treatment if they plan to become pregnant during the course of treatment with
             mepolizumab.

          -  Subject has a known allergy or intolerance to a monoclonal antibody or biologic
             therapy including mepolizumab.

          -  Subject had an adverse event (serious or non-serious) considered related to study
             treatment whilst participating in a clinical study with mepolizumab which resulted in
             permanent withdrawal of study treatment.

          -  Subject is receiving treatment with another biological therapy such as a monoclonal
             antibody therapy or intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy.

          -  Subjects who have received treatment with an investigational drug within the past 30
             days or 5 terminal phase half-lives of the drug whichever is longer, prior to
             initiation of mepolizumab treatment under this Long-term Access Programme (this also
             includes investigational formulations of marketed products).

          -  Subject is currently participating in any other interventional clinical study.
