    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-masked, bilateral, dispensing,
      parallel-group clinical trial design. All subjects will participate in a 2-week daily
      disposable contact lens adaptation period prior to being randomized into one of the four
      extended wear lenses. The study has a total of 9 scheduled study visits and a total duration
      of ~197 days. The lenses will be replaced with a fresh pair after 6 nights / 7 days of wear.

             this clinical protocol.

          -  The subject must be at least 18 and no more than 39 years of age.

          -  The subject's spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range of -1.00
             to -5.50 diopters in each eye.

          -  The subject's refractive cylinder must be less than 1.00 diopters in each eye.

          -  The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye.

          -  The subject must be without history of contact lens use in the past 12 months.

          -  The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous experience wearing contact lenses on an overnight or extended wear basis
             (at least 1 night per month)

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating (self reported) (subjects who become pregnant during
             the study will be discontinued).

          -  Currently a regular smoker (1 or more times per month).

          -  Current routine swimmer (1 or more times per month).

          -  Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          -  Any systemic disease (ex. Sj√∂gren's Syndrome), autoimmune disease (ex. rheumatoid
             arthritis), or use of medication (ex. chronic steroid use), which may interfere with
             contact lens wear.

          -  Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion by
             keratometry.

          -  Any previous or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
             photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), etc.).

          -  Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Any ocular infection.

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          -  Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 7 days
             prior to study enrollment.

          -  History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus.

          -  Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g., HIV) by self report).

          -  Employee of investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).
