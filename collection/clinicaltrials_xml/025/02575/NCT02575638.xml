  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non-randomized feasibility and Phase I trial of 20(S) Camptothecin
      Propionate administered orally. CZ48 will be administered in successive cohorts of 1 patient
      per participating site until hints of toxicity (grade 2 or worse adverse events related to
      the drug) are observed. Then cohorts of 3+3 patients will be treated. CZ48 will be
      administered orally daily (1 course = 4 weeks). No pre-medications will be administered.
      Patients will be asked to drink up to one gallon of fluid daily if possible to flush the
      bladder to mitigate cystitis. Cystitis is an anticipated toxicity as CZ48 is a pro-drug of
      CPT (Camptothecin)

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      â€¢ To describe the dose limiting toxicities and adverse event profile of
      Camptothecin-20-O-Propionate hydrate (CZ48) administered orally every day for 4 weeks (1
      course).

      SECONDARYOBJECTIVE

        -  To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Camptothecin-20-O-Propionate hydrate
           (CZ48).

        -  To determine the blood plasma levels (PK study) of orally administered CZ48.

        -  To assess responses by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria
           when applicable.

        -  To follow patients for survival.

    <description>The study drug, CZ48, is administered orally in capsule form t.i.d. Capsules in 30mg and 50mg of drug are available for dosing. This is a dose escalation study so dosage has not yet been determined. Study drug is take on day 1 - 5 and then no drug on day 6 and 7. This is repeated for 4 weeks, or one course.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a Performance Status (Zubrod) performance status of 0-1

          -  Patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined by an absolute peripheral
             granulocyte count of &gt; 1,500 /mm3 and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3 along with an
