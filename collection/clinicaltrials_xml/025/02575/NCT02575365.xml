    <textblock>
      This is a 24-month, open-label, multicenter study with a single treatment arm design.

      Primary objective of this study is:

      -To investigate the effects of Fingolimod on cognitive performance in highly active
      relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients

      Secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To investigate the correlation between the effect of fingolimod on cognitive
           performances and MRI data.

        -  To evaluate the effect of fingolimod on biomarkers (24 hydroxy cholesterol, osteopontin
           and matrix metalloproteinases) related to neurodegeneration

        -  To investigate the effect of fingolimod on brain gray matter atrophy and thalamic
           atrophy.

      Polulation We will recruit a minimum of 80 relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients according
      to the McDonald criteria.
