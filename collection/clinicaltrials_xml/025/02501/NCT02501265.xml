  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test an adaptive pharmacotherapy algorithm within the Duke Smoking
      Cessation Program (DSCP). The investigators hypothesize that patients treated in the DSCP
      with Algorithm-based pharmacotherapy vs. Varenicline will show significantly higher 12-week
      post-quit 30-day continuous abstinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a cross-randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate an
      algorithm-based pharmacotherapy approach to treating tobacco use ('Algorithm') and the
      efficacy of a high intensity behavioral treatment in comparison to the standard of care. The
      Algorithm is designed to assist clinicians in identifying the appropriate pharmacotherapy
      and behavioral interventions to treat tobacco use and to provide additional medications to
      individuals who do not decrease tobacco use following two weeks of pre-quit pharmacotherapy
      ('Non-Responders'). The population group is recruited from patients being seen at the Duke
      Smoking Cessation Program. Outcomes of abstinence variables will be analyzed using general
      regression models using an ANOVA-based design; randomization status to both pharmacotherapy
      and behavioral groups will be denoted using a proxy variable to test primary study effects.
      An alpha criterion of 0.05 (two-tailed) will be used in all comparisons. Risk for the study
      is low as all pharmacotherapies being evaluated are FDA-approved for tobacco use treatment.

    <description>High-Intensity Behavioral Treatment (HIT) is a video-based intensive group-therapy intervention that integrates motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral skills training, mindfulness training, and group therapy techniques. HIT is comprised of seven weekly meetings (2 ½ hours each) with a 6½-hour meeting on the quit day (24 total hours), and is taught by DSCP Instructors (typically therapists). Intervention participants are provided with web-based access to the Instructional Video, Course Manual and a Guided Audio Recording to practice relapse prevention skills.</description>

      <textblock>
        Participants being screened are being treated at the Translational Smoking Cessation
        Program (TSCP). Practically speaking, however, the TSCP will only be treating patients who
        have self-reported as smokers, who are 18 years of age or older, and who would like to
        quit smoking.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient being treated at DSCP for tobacco use

          2. Age 18 years or older

          3. Actively smoking 5 or more cigarettes per day for at least one year

          4. Fluency in spoken and written English

          5. Willing to set a quit date within 6 weeks

          6. Access to a telephone

          7. Willingness to attend 7 weeks (24 hours) of group therapy on specific offered dates.

          8. Willingness to take Varenicline, Bupropion and Nicotine Patch.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. CO test under 7 ppm

          2. 8 or above on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-10)

          3. 6 or above on Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10)

          4. 3 or above on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) Depression Scale

          5. Daily use of a second form of tobacco or nicotine (e.g. e-cigarettes, cigars, chewing
             tobacco, snuff)

          6. Current use of a smoking cessation medication (e.g. nicotine replacement,
             Varenicline, Bupropion)

          7. Intolerable side effects related to, refusal to take, or medical contraindication to
             the use of Varenicline, nicotine patch, or Bupropion.

          8. Symptomatic cognitive or emotive disorder such as untreated schizophrenia, severe
             untreated depression, anxiety. This is determined by clinical assessment.

          9. Disruptive behavior toward staff. Because subjects are requested to engage in group
             behavioral treatment, this criterion is for the protection of other participants
             within group treatment.

         10. Report of pregnancy, attempting to get pregnant, or actively breast feeding.

         11. Positive urine pregnancy test (only given to females with child bearing potential)
