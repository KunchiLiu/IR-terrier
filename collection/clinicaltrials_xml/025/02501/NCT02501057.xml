      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of interventions for drinking-reduction
      and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among HIV-positive primary care patients. The
      interventions consist of brief meetings to discuss drinking and ART adherence enhanced with
      daily self-monitoring through the use of a smart phone application that tracks drinking and
      other aspects of health. These meetings will either be based on the Clinician's Guide, a
      brief intervention for heavy drinking in primary care settings advocated by the National
      Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or Motivational Interviewing. Participants will
      be assessed at baseline, 30, 60, 90 days, 6 and 12 months after baseline. By the end of
      treatment (60 days) and throughout the follow-up period, alcohol use is expected to highest
      among participants who receive the Clinician's Guide alone, intermediate among participants
      who receive the enhanced Clinician's Guide, and lowest among participants who receive
      enhanced Motivational Interviewing.

    <textblock>
      HIV infection is a widespread health problem in the U.S. Antiretroviral (ART) therapy has
      increased longevity and changed the nature of risk factors for morbidity and mortality.
      Alcohol consumption has become an increasingly serious health issue among HIV primary care
      patients. Drinking is a key factor in progression to severe liver damage (especially those
      co-infected with hepatitis), and liver disease is now one of the most common causes of death
      among those with HIV. Excess drinking is also associated with medication noncompliance,
      reduces the effect of antiretroviral treatment, and is linked to other health problems.
      Therefore, helping HIV patients reduce unsafe drinking is crucial to their long-term health.
      This study aims to evaluate two evidence-based approaches when combined with an innovative
      smart phone application designed to help users track drinking and other aspects of health.
      An effective, easily implemented alcohol-reduction intervention could be incorporated into
      standard care in HIV clinics to help prevent or slow the progress of some medical problems
      in HIV-infected individuals, improve medication compliance, prolong lifespan and decrease
      risk behavior associated with alcohol use.
