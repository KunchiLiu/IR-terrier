  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drawing on a vertical surface, such as a blackboard (rather than a horizontal surface) is
      often used by occupational therapists as a way of developing fine motor control and visual
      motor integration in children. While there is anecdotal evidence to support this
      intervention, preliminary results in healthy children showed no differences in graphical
      quality while drawing on vertical or horizontal surfaces. This however was not investigated
      in children with graphomotor impairments.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether movements produced on a vertical surface
      differ in their performance level and muscle activation patterns compared to movements
      produced on a horizontal surface. The investigators predict that the level of performance on
      the vertical surface will exceed the level of performance on the horizontal surface.
      Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that the proximal muscles will be more activated
      and fatigued (in longer tasks) while drawing on the vertical surface, while the distal
      muscle will be more activated and fatigued while drawing on the horizontal surface.

    <description>The MVC value for each muscle will be computed as the average of three peaks of the sEMG data, which differed by no more than 10% from one another. The mean root mean square (RMS) values of the sEMG data will be normalized by the MVC value for each muscle.
Also, frequency analysis will be performed on the EMG data collected during paths trailing, separately for each inclination. Median power frequency (MDF) will be computed following short-time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrogram calculation using a Hanning sliding 500ms window. Fatigue is associated with a compression of the power spectral density of the EMG towards the lower frequencies, so that a decrease in MDF corresponds to an increase in fatigue</description>

    <description>As the tablet only records when the stylus touches the tablet, movement start and end will be determined from the first and last time the stylus touched the tablet. The movement time will be computed as the amount of time the stylus contacted the surface of the tablet. For each of the four copying tasks, the closest ideal curve was found, defined as the having the same shape as the prototype being copied, but potentially with a different scale and location (relative to the bounding box). This ideal curve was found by minimizing the sum of the squared distance between the curve drawn and a parameterized version of the shape. The minimization was achieved using the simplex algorithm.
Mean error is defined as the mean squared distance between the drawn shape and the ideal shape</description>

    <description>After the parents sign an informed consent form, they will fill out a demographic questionnaire. Than if the Beery VMI test was not yet administered, it would be performed, as well as the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCD-Q). Surface electromyography electrodes will be placed on the Upper Trapezius, Extensor Carpi Radialis, and Biceps brachii of the child's dominant hand.
The subject will perform 4 copying tasks and 2 tracing tasks on a tablet placed once on a horizontal surface (while sitting) and once on a vertical surface (while standing).</description>
