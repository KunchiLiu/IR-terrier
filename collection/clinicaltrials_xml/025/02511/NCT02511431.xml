      Background:

      - Chronic hepatitis D is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis D virus. It can be severe
      and progressive. Most people with hepatitis D will develop scarring and damage to the liver.
      There is no FDA approved drug to treat chronic hepatitis D. Researchers want to know if the
      drugs lonafarnib and ritonavir can help people with chronic hepatitis D.

      Objective:

      - To find out if treatment of hepatitis D with lonafarnib and ritonavir is safe and
      effective.

      Eligibility:

      - People 18 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis D. They must not have HIV or other
      major illnesses.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exams, and blood tests.

        -  Participants will have 24 weeks of treatment. They will then have 24 weeks of
           follow-up.

        -  Participants will be in 1 of 6 treatment groups. Those in each group will receive
           different doses of the study drugs. Some groups will start with placebo but will
           receive treatment after 3 months of placebo.

        -  Participants will also take drugs to treat hepatitis B.

        -  Participants will have many visits. These will include:

        -  One three-day stay at the Clinical Center

        -  Physical exams

        -  EKG: small sticky patches will be put on the chest, arms, and legs to trace heart
           rhythm

        -  Ultrasounds of the abdomen

        -  Urine and blood tests

        -  Stool samples

        -  Eye exams

        -  Evaluations by a reproductive endocrinologist (women) or urologist (men). Men may
           provide a sperm sample (optional).

    <textblock>
      Chronic delta hepatitis is a serious form of chronic liver disease caused by infection with
      the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a small RNA virus that requires farnesylation of its major
      structural protein (HDV antigen) for replication. We propose to treat 21 adult patients with
      chronic delta hepatitis using the combination of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI)
      lonafarnib (LNF) and the protease inhibitor ritonavir (RTV). LNF has been shown to decrease
      serum quantitative HDV RNA in patients with chronic delta hepatitis infection, but dosing is
      limited by its side effects. RTV inhibits one of the cytochrome P-450 systems that
      metabolizes LNF leading to higher serum levels of LNF with minimal side effects. In this
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, there will be six groups of patients;
      Group 1(4 patients) will receive LNF/RTV 50/100 mg daily for 24 weeks, Group 2 (4 patients)
      will receive LNF/RTV 75/100mg daily for 24 weeks, Group 3 (4 patients) will receive LNF/RTV
      100/100mg daily for 24 weeks, Group 4, 5 and 6 (3 patients for each group) will initially
      receive placebo for 12 weeks followed by either LNF/RTV 50/100 mg daily (3 patients) or
      LNF/RTV 75/100mg daily (3 patients) or LNF/RTV 100/100 mg daily (3 patients) for 12 weeks.
      After dosing, all patients will be monitored for 24 weeks off therapy. Nucleos(t)ide
      analogue therapy will be instituted during this study to prevent the possibility of HBV
      reactivation/flare; Patients on pre-existing nucleos(t)ide analogues will be continued and
      patients not on pre-existing therapy will receive either entecavir or tenofovir for 48
      weeks. Patients with quantifiable HDV RNA in serum and elevated aminotransferases will be
      enrolled. Before receiving therapy, patients will be evaluated for at least 3 visits with
      regular testing for HDV RNA quantitation and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and will
      undergo Clinical Center admission for medical evaluation, timed blood draws and to start
      therapy. At each clinic visit, patients will be questioned about side effects, symptoms and
      quality of life, undergo focused physical examination, and have blood drawn for complete
      blood counts, HDV RNA, and routine liver tests (including ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase,
      direct and total bilirubin, and albumin). At the end of the treatment, patients will undergo
      repeat physical examination, assessment of symptoms (using a symptom scale questionnaire),
      complete blood counts, routine liver tests, and hepatitis B and D viral markers. The primary
      therapeutic endpoint will be a decline of HDV RNA viral titer of 2 logs at the end of
      therapy. The primary safety endpoint will be the ability to tolerate the drugs at the
      prescribed dose for the full course of therapy. Several secondary endpoints will be
      measured, including side effects, ALT levels, maintained virological response, undetectable
      HDV RNA in the serum, loss of HBsAg and symptoms. Therapy will be stopped for intolerance to
      lonafarnib and/or ritonavir (which will be carefully defined). This clinical trial is
      designed as a phase 2a study assessing the antiviral activity, safety and tolerance of three
      different doses of lonafarnib and ritonavir.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Age 18 years or above, male or female.

               2. Serum alanine or aspartate aminotransferase activities above the upper limit of
                  normal (ALT greater than or equal to 20 or AST greater than or equal to 20 U/L
                  in females and ALT greater than or equal to 30 or AST greater than or equal to
                  30 U/L in males) on an average of three determinations taken during the previous
                  6 months at the NIH clinical center. The mean of the three determinations will
                  be defined as baseline levels.

               3. Presence of anti-HDV in serum.

               4. Presence of quantifiable HDV RNA in serum.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Decompensated liver disease, defined by bilirubin &gt;4mg/dL, albumin &lt;3.0 gm/dL,
             prothrombin time &gt;2 sec prolonged, or history of bleeding esophageal varices, ascites
             or hepatic encephalopathy. Laboratory abnormalities that are not thought to be due to
             liver disease may not necessarily require exclusion. Patients with ALT levels greater
             than 1000 U/L (&gt;25 times ULN) will not be enrolled but may be followed until three
             determinations are below this level.

          2. Pregnancy, active breast-feeding, or inability to practice adequate contraception, in
             women of childbearing potential or in spouses of such women. Adequate contraception
             is defined as vasectomy in men, tubal ligation in women, or use of two barrier
             methods such as condoms and spermicide combination, birth control pills, an
             intrauterine device, Depo-Provera, or Norplant. In total, the participant and their
             partner must utilize two forms of contraception and one method must include a barrier
             method.

          3. Significant systemic or major illnesses other than liver disease, including, but not
             limited to, congestive heart failure, renal failure (eGFR &lt;50 ml/min), organ
             transplantation, serious psychiatric disease or depression (only if felt to be at
             high risk by the NIH psychiatric consultation service), and active coronary artery
             disease.

          4. Systemic immunosuppressive therapy within the previous 2 months.

          5. Evidence of another form of liver disease in addition to viral hepatitis (for example
             autoimmune liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis,
             Wilson disease, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (but not
             steatosis), hemochromatosis, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency).

          6. Active substance abuse, such as alcohol, inhaled or injection drugs within the
             previous year.

          7. Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.

          8. Evidence of concurrent hepatitis C infection with positive serum HCV RNA.

          9. Any experimental therapy or pegylated interferon therapy within 6 months prior to
             enrollment.

         10. Diagnosis of malignancy in the five years prior to the enrollment with exception
             granted to superficial dermatologic malignancies.

         11. Evidence of HIV co-infection; HIV 1/2 viral RNA or antigen on serum testing.

         12. Concurrent usage of statins as these drugs inhibits mevalonate synthesis, which
             reduces protein prenylation.

         13. Concurrent usage of moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers.

         14. Use of any prescription, nonprescription or natural medicine (herbal) medications
             unless the use of medication is medically necessary with appropriate monitoring.

         15. Concurrent usage of alpha 1 adrenoreceptor antagonist, antiarrhythmic, pimozide,
             sildenafil, sedative and hypnotics, ergot and St. John s Wort due to possible effect
             of ritonavir on hepatic metabolism of these drugs resulting in potentially life
             threatening side effects.

         16. Clinically significant baseline EKG abnormalities.

         17. Uncontrolled elevated triglycerides.

         18. History of pancreatitis as a result of hypertriglyceridemia.

         19. Inability to understand or sign informed consent.

         20. Any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigators would impede the
             patient s participation or compliance in the study.
