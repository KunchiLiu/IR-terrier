  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure local inflammatory responses in patients undergoing an
      allogeneic stem cell transplant and attempt to define any set of biomarkers that are
      significantly altered in acute or chronic skin graft versus host disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute skin graft versus host disease is a significant complication following allogeneic stem
      cell transplant. To date, there are no specific dermal biomarkers that predict or define the
      onset of acute skin graft versus host disease. The primary objective of this study is to
      observe the changes in the inflammatory environment of the skin during the process of acute
      and chronic skin graft versus host disease. This will be accomplished by using a
      non-invasive transdermal patch called D-Squame to analyze inflammatory cytokines and key
      epidermal proteins. Patients will be enrolled prior to receiving a stem cell transplant and
      followed weekly after stem cell infusion until day 99. If acute skin graft versus host
      disease develops, they will be followed weekly until resolution of acute graft versus host
      disease or development of chronic graft versus host disease, whichever occurs first.
      Patients with a diagnosis of chronic skin graft versus host disease will be enrolled and
      followed weekly until 4 weeks, irrespective of clinical course. In addition, healthy
      controls will be enrolled and used as comparators. The relevance of this study is to provide
      a better understanding of the local inflammatory environment induced by acute or chronic
      skin graft versus host disease. This is likely to enable the investigators to define a
      biomarker panel that predicts the onset of acute graft versus host disease rapidly and
      non-invasively.

    <description>This study arm includes patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation at CCHMC and develop acute graft versus host disease. Skin cell samples will be collected using the D-SQUAME Skin Sampling Discs. The first baseline skin sample will be obtained prior to the preparative regimen for stem cell transplant. Samples will be collected weekly after stem cell infusion until 8 weeks, if acute GVHD does not develop. If acute GVHD does develop, weekly samples will continue to be collected until resolution of acute GVHD or development of chronic GVHD, whichever occurs first. Blood samples will be collected at these same time points.</description>

    <description>This study arm includes healthy age matched controls as comparisons to study participants who develop graft versus host disease. These controls may be either healthy age matched siblings of patients who develop acute graft versus host disease or healthy age matched siblings of patients that are seen in the bone marrow transplant, oncology, or hematology clinics. A one-time single skin cell sample will be collected using a D-SQUAME Skin Sampling Disc. Blood samples will not be collected from the healthy controls.</description>

    <description>A D-SQUAME Skin Sampling Disc is a noninvasive patch that collects skin cell samples when affixed to the superficial stratum corneum (top layer of skin). The patch is applied with gentle pressure to the desired quadrant of the forearm and removed 2 minutes after application.</description>
