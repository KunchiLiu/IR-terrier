      The purpose of this Phase 1b, multi-centre, dose escalation study is to find the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of AZD1775 combined with olaparib in patients with refractory solid
      tumours

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, multi-centre study of AZD1775 combined with olaparib administered orally
      in patients with refractory solid tumours, or as first-line sequential combination therapy
      for extensive disease (ED) small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). There are 3 parts to the study
      design:

      Part A: Dose Escalation Part B: Dose Expansion Part C: Expansion in first-line ED SCLC

      In Part A, patients with refractory solid tumours will be assessed for safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD 1775 when combined with olaparib. Different dose levels
      will be administered to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D).

      The dose expansion part (Part B) will further explore the safety, PK, and efficacy of the
      MTD/RP2D and dosing schedule, through cohorts organized by tumour type with molecular
      biomarkers of interest in the following treatment cohorts:

      Ovarian Cancer

        -  Twenty patients with confirmed BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation. Patients must have
           exhausted all standard treatment options, however must not have received prior
           treatment with a PARP-inhibitor.

        -  Twenty patients with confirmed BRCA wild-type status. Patients must have exhausted all
           standard treatment options for advanced disease (recurrent or metastatic).

      Triple Negative Breast Cancer

        -  Patients must have previously been treated with at least 1 chemotherapy-containing
           regimen for advanced disease (recurrent or metastatic).

        -  Approximately 15 biomarker positive (amplification of at least one of the following
           genes: CCNE1, MYC, MYCL, or MYCN) and 15 biomarker negative patients will be treated,
           with the potential to recruit up to an additional 20 patients.

      Second-Line Small Cell Lung Cancer

        -  Patients must have previously been treated with no more than one
           chemotherapy-containing regimen for advanced disease (recurrent or metastatic), and
           relapsed at least 90 days following completion of that treatment.

        -  Approximately 15 biomarker positive (amplification of at least one of the following
           genes: CCNE1, MYC, MYCL, or MYCN) and 15 biomarker negative patients will be treated,
           with the potential to recruit up to an additional 20 patients.

      Part C is a dose expansion arm in first-line SCLC patients with ED who have demonstrated an
      objective complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease with measurable
      tumour shrinkage following two cycles of a Standard of Care chemotherapy regimen containing
      etoposide and platinum. The combination of AZD 1775 and olaparib will be evaluated as a
      first-line sequential combination therapy.

      An olaparib pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study will precede the combined treatment with AZD1775
      and olaparib for all patients. In the PK sub-study olaparib will be taken orally BID for 3
      days and venous blood samples will be collected on Day 3 for assessment of the multiple dose
      pharmacokinetics of single agent olaparib. Patients will experience a short gap in treatment
      (approximately 4-5 days) between Day 3 of the olaparib PK sub-study and Cycle 1 Day 1 of the
      combination treatment.

      Patients will continue to receive treatment with AZD1775 and Olaparib until disease
      progression, intolerable toxicity, or discontinuation criteria have been met.

             Conduction abnormality not controlled with pacemaker or medication Significant

             atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac abnormalities are eligible)

         15. Patient with mean resting corrected QT interval (specifically QTc calculated using
             the Fridericia formula [QTcF]) ≥470 msec for female patients and ≥450 msec for male
             patients from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) performed within 5 minutes apart at study
             entry or congenital long QT syndrome. For patients in Part C, the ECG assessments
             will be obtained at the beginning of the Stage 2 screening.

         16. Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

         17. Serious known active infection at the time of enrolment, or another serious
             underlying medical condition that would impair the ability of the patient to receive

         18. Presence of other known active invasive cancers.

         19. Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood

             collection

             compliance with protocol.

         22. Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within
             3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric
             disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

         23. Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive
