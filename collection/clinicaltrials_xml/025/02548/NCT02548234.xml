  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to compare the efficacy of mirror therapy and bilateral arm training on
      movement strategies of the affected upper extremity and functional outcome in chronic stroke
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study background: Approximately 80% of stroke survivors have an upper and/or lower limb
      impairment (Barker 1997), and impairment of the arm explains up to 50% of the variance in
      functional limitation after stroke. Brain imaging research using magnetoencephalography
      found that mirror therapy combined with bilateral arm training could potentially aid stroke
      rehabilitation by normalizing an asymmetrical pattern of movement-related beta
      desynchronization in primary motor cortex. However, different neural mechanisms may cause
      different effect of motor control recovery after the two different approaches, which have
      yet to be studied. Study purpose：To compare the efficacy of mirror therapy and bilateral arm
      training on movement strategies of the affected upper extremity and functional outcome in
      chronic stroke patients. Study method: This was a single-blind, randomized, comparative
      efficacy research. Sixty participants with chronic stroke will be recruited in China medical
      university hospital and randomly assigned to the mirror therapy and bilateral arm training
      groups. The intervention will consist of 1.5 hrs/day, 5 days/wk for 4 wks, including 3 days
      of hospital-based therapy and 5 days of home treatments. Primary outcomes were muscular
      properties (muscle tone and stiffness) and sensorimotor measurements. Secondary outcomes
      included measures of daily functions and acceleration to gain insight about movement
      capabilities. The validity and reliability of all measurements have been proposed. Finally,
      Chi-square test, Analysis of variance and Analysis of covariance will be used to compare the
      significant differences in mean values between the two approaches. Partial η2 will be
      reported also for the effect size of dependent variables.
