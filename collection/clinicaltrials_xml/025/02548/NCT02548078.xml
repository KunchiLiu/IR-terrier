  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of a single IM dose of
      the ChAd3 EBO-Z vaccine, overall and in children aged 1 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 17 years,
      separately Considering the risk of exposure to Ebola and the potential (based on animal
      data) for the investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine to afford at least partial protection, all
      children in the study will receive the investigational ChAd3 EBO-Z vaccine. The children in
      the Group EBO-Z/ MENACWY-TT will receive the investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine at Day 0 of
      the study, whereas the children in the Group MENACWY-TT/ EBO-Z will receive Nimenrix at Day
      0 (as a control). At Month 6, the children in the Group MENACWY-TT/ EBO-Z will receive the
      investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine (provided that no safety concerns are raised), whereas
      the children in the Group EBO-Z/ MENACWY-TT will receive Nimenrix..
