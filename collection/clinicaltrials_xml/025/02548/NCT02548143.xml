  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study, PerSept 3, is to evaluate LR769 for the prevention of excessive
      bleeding and achievement of hemostasis in congenital hemophilia A or B patients who have
      inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX , are aged 6 months to 75 years, inclusive; and who
      are undergoing elective surgical or other invasive procedures. Administration of LR769 will
      be performed just prior to surgery/procedure and will be repeated during and after the
      surgery/procedure to achieve and maintain adequate hemostasis as determined by the
      investigator's judgment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an international, multicenter, single-arm, Phase 3 study. Patients aged 6
      months to 75 years, inclusive, who have congenital hemophilia A or B with inhibitors to
      Factor VIII or Factor IX and who are scheduled for an elective surgical or other invasive
      procedure will be enrolled. Both major and minor surgical or other invasive procedures are
      allowed in the study.

      Initial Treatment: Regardless of procedure, patients who meet all eligibility criteria will
      receive an initial intravenous (IV) bolus dose of 75 - 200 µg/kg of LR769 administered
      within ≤2 minutes before the surgical incision or start of the invasive procedure. The
      initial dose will be selected by the investigator in conjunction with the
      surgeon/practitioner based on the complexity of the procedure, the number of tissue planes
      to be traversed, the patient's previous responses to bypassing agents, and other factors
      deemed relevant by the investigator. Administration will be repeated no more frequently than
      every 2 hours (±5 minutes) during and after surgery or invasive procedure.

      Treatment for Major Surgical Procedures: The initial dose of LR769 will be followed by
      repeated administration of 75 µg/kg of LR769 every 2 hours (±5 minutes) for the first 48
      hours after completion of the procedure. The minimum duration of LR769 treatment for major
      procedures will be 5 days and dosing frequency will be followed according to the guidelines
      specified in the protocol.

      Treatment for Minor Surgical or Other Invasive Procedures: The initial dose of LR769 will be
      followed by repeated administration of 75 µg/kg of LR769 every 2 hours (±5 minutes) for the
      first 48 hours. The minimum duration of LR769 infusion for minor procedures will be 2 days,
      except for certain procedures that may not require this duration of treatment to achieve
      hemostasis as noted below.

          9. have a history of arterial and/or venous thromboembolic events (such as myocardial
             infarction, ischemic strokes, transient ischemic attacks, deep venous thrombosis
             (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)) within 2 years prior to the planned first dose of
             LR769, uncontrolled arrhythmia, or current New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             functional classification score of stages II - IV

         10. have an active malignancy (those with non-melanoma skin cancer are allowed)

         11. have any life-threatening disease or other disease or condition which, according to
             the investigator's judgment, could imply a potential hazard to the patient, or
