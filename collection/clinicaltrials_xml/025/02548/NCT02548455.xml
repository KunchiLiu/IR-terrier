    <textblock>
      The primary intent of this study is to assess the safety of the model 1457Q Quartet Left
      Ventricular (LV) lead at 3 months in a patient population indicated for cardiac
      resynchronization therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, IDE clinical study designed to evaluate the safety of
      the Model 1457Q Quartet LV lead.

      A minimum of 94 and a maximum of 430 subjects will be enrolled in this study at up to 40
      centers worldwide.

      All subjects successfully implanted with a Quartet 1457Q lead will be followed every 6
      months post implant until Pre Market Approval (PMA) is obtained or the study is closed.
      After completing participation in the IDE study, subjects will continue participation in a
      post-approval study, and return for follow up visits every 6 months post implant until 5
      years of follow up visits post implant are completed.
