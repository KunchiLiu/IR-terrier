      This study evaluates the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) for the treatment of anxiety in adults
      certified for medical marijuana. Participants will use a sublingual (under-the-tongue)
      tincture of whole plant derived CBD three times daily for four weeks in addition to their
      normal treatment regimen. Participants' clinical state will be assessed weekly during the
      treatment period. In addition, cognitive function and measures of quality of life, sleep,
      general health, and multimodal neuroimaging will be assessed at baseline and the
      post-treatment final visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis has been used for medicinal purposes across many cultures for a range of disorders
      dating as far back as 2700 B.C. The plant is comprised of a variety of components, including
      phytocannabinoids that act on CB1 and CB2 receptors. Numerous phytocannabinoids are present
      in cannabis, including the major psychoactive constituent of cannabis, delta-9
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which acts as a CB1 receptor agonist. Another phytocannabinoid,
      cannabidiol (CBD), is a major non-psychoactive constituent of cannabis and is only a partial
      agonist at CB1 receptors. Increasing evidence indicates that CBD in particular may have
      significant medicinal properties and benefits; experimental studies in both animals and
      humans have demonstrated that CBD can act as an anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, and muscle
      relaxant. CBD is often found in higher levels in products dispensed as medical marijuana
      relative to strains used primarily for recreational use. Several studies have demonstrated
      that CBD produces acute anxiolytic effects in animals and humans, although thus far no
      clinical trials of CBD have been conducted in patients with anxiety. As a growing number of
      states are legalizing medical marijuana, a gap exists in the scientific literature regarding
      the effects of CBD on anxiety.

      This investigation is composed of two phases. Phase 1 is comprised of a four-week, open
      label clinical trial of a high-CBD containing compound (22:1 CBD:THC) in individuals with
      anxiety. Participants will be pre-screened by phone in order to evaluate their eligibility
      for the study. If approved, participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening
      visit, and will complete a structured clinical interview, clinical and quality of life
      questionnaires, cognitive assessments, and an hour-long MRI scan. Enrolled participants will
      be given tincture to use for the duration of the study; participants will be instructed to
      self-administer 2 milliliters (ml) of the tincture under the tongue three times per day for
      four weeks. Throughout the treatment period, participants will return to the hospital on a
      weekly basis to complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants
      will also return to the hospital for a final visit after four weeks of treatment to complete
      additional questionnaires, cognitive assessments, and another hour-long MRI scan.

      Phase 2 of the study is a double-blind clinical trial of this tincture in patients with
      anxiety. This double-blind trial will begin after the open-label trial has been completed.
      In the same manner as the open-label trial, participants will be pre-screened by phone, and
      approved participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit to complete a
      structured clinical interview, questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Eligible
      participants will also have the option to complete an hour-long MRI scan at the baseline and
      final visits. Enrolled participants will receive either CBD tincture or placebo tincture to
      self-administer throughout the four week treatment period, as described above. Participants
      will return to the hospital weekly during the treatment period to complete questionnaires
      about their mood and quality of life. Participants in this phase of the study will also
      return for a final visit after four weeks of treatment to complete additional
      questionnaires, cognitive assessments, and an optional hour-long MRI scan.
