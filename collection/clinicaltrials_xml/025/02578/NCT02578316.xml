    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the metabolism and elimination of 14C-lenvatinib
      in participants with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas, who were unsuitable for, or had
      failed, existing therapies.

    <textblock>
      The study comprised of two phases, the Study Phase and Extension Phase. Participants
      received 14C-lenvatinib on Day 1 of the Study Phase. Thereafter participants were given
      daily oral doses of 24 mg of lenvatinib over a 28 day cycle. During the Study Phase,
      participants received an initial single dose of 14C-lenvatinib oral patient dosing solution
      containing 24 mg of lenvatinib as anhydrous free base and radioactivity of 100 mCi (3.7 MBq)
      on Day 1, followed by collection of blood, urine and feces samples for pharmacokinetic
      analysis between Day 1 and Day 8, with a discharge visit on Day 8. Participants then entered
      the Extension Phase of the study to continue to receive once daily oral administration of
      non-radiolabeled lenvatinib at a dose of 24 mg. Each 28-day dosing period will be considered
      one treatment cycle.
