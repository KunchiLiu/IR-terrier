  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized study will assess the effectiveness of externally applied micro current
      electrical stimulation on improving the visual acuity in subjects with vision loss from dry
      (non-neovascular) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) over a 6 week period.
