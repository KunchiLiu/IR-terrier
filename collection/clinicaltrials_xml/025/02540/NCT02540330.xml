    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized pharmacokinetic study of fulvestrant in women
      scheduled for mastectomy or lumpectomy. Eligible subjects will be identified with breast
      cancer or DCIS. The first subject of each of five groups will receive fulvestrant
      intramuscularly. The subsequent 5 subjects of each group will receive fulvestrant by
      intraductal instillation. All subjects will be monitored for systemic and local adverse
      events during the procedure, and following the procedure until mastectomy or lumpectomy.
      Subjects that receive fulvestrant will undergo serial blood draws to determine fulvestrant
      blood concentration levels.
