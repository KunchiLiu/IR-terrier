    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAX69 monotherapy
      given either as intraperitoneal (IP) infusion (Single-Route Arm); or as IP infusion after
      intravenous (IV) infusion (IV+IP) (Double-Route Arm), and to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for each Arm separately, in subjects with
      refractory ovarian cancer and recurrent malignant ascites. In both Arms, the plasma
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAX69 will be characterized, and pharmacodynamics (PD) markers will
      be explored in plasma and ascites. Two expansion cohorts will further assess the
      tolerability of the RP2D and explore clinical signs of efficacy.
