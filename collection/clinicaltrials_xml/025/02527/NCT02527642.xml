  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-center study in otherwise healthy infertile female
      subjects undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The subjects recruited for this study will
      be among those patients who have been diagnosed with infertility and are planning to undergo
      IVF at the centers where this study is being performed. The patients will have undergone the
      usual informed consent procedure at the center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval, IVF, and Intra Cytoplasmic
      Sperm Injection (ICSI) procedure following the center's usual procedures. The cohort of
      injected oocytes from each patient will be randomly divided between the one step and
      sequential medias: CRM (Cornell- Center for Reproductive Medicine) media (C1/C2 or C3) vs
      G-TL Time Lapse media or G-1/G-2 media. Single step or sequential media are both buffered
      mediums for culture from oocyte fertilization to blastocyst stage. Sequential media is
      formulated according to the stages of embryo development and embryos are re-cultured in
      medias according to their stage of development. Single step (time lapse) media is formulated
      for continuous culture from D0 to Day 5/6.

      Mature oocytes will be randomized via a non-bias computer program into two to four of the
      study groups: G-TL commercial single step (Vitrolife), Vitrolife's sequential media,
      Cornell's single step , and Cornell's sequential media. Oocytes will be divided randomly
      among the various media dependent upon the number of mature oocytes. I.e.: 10 oocytes
      injected = 2 media groups; 15 oocytes injected = up to 3 media groups; 20 oocytes injected =
      up to 4 media groups.

      &quot;Best grade&quot; embryos will be transferred regardless of media source. If embryos are
      transferred from multi-source media and if researchers are unable to determine the media
      source after transfer, the subject will not be included in the outcome data portion of the
      study- e.g pregnancy outcome.

      The Time-Lapse monitoring system will be used as standard clinical practice to observe
      development and document timing of embryo cleavages and morphology dynamics.

      Endpoints will be Day 3 and Day 5/6 embryo development, implantation and pregnancy rate. The
      study is approximately 2 months, the estimated time it takes a physician to perform one
      IVF-ART IVF- Assisted Reproductive Technology) treatment cycle. If embryos are frozen, the
      patient may be in the study until the time they choose to thaw the embryos or up to 1 year
      if they become pregnant.
