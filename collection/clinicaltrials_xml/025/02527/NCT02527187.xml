      The main objective is to evaluate the concentration of allergen extract of Betula verrucosa
      that elicit a papule equivalent to that produced by a solution of histamine dihydrochloride
      10 mg / ml in size.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive clinical history or not of inhalation allergy (rhinitis I
             rhinoconjunctivitis I asthma) from Betula verrucosa

          -  Allergic subjects, must submit a prick-test positive (average of the papule &gt; 3 mm
             diameter) with a summary of the same allergen I presence against the allergen
             specific Immunoglobulin E.

          -  The average diameter of the papule obtained by histamine dihydrochloride to 10 mgml
             must be &gt;3mm

          -  Age: from 5 to 70 years.

          -  They must be capable of giving informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects outside of the age range.

          -  Subjects who have previously received immunotherapy in the last 5 years for the
             treatment of asthma or the allergic rhinoconjunctivitis induced by allergens that may
             interfere with the allergen from Betula extract verrucosa

          -  Subjects with important symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis I bronchial asthma in which
             the suspension of the antihistamine treatment for systemic is contraindicated.

             prick test diagnostic tests.

          -  Subjects treated with ss-blockers.

          -  Unstable subjects of clinical point of view (asthma acute, febrile, etc).

          -  Subjects with lesions of active hives, severe active dermographism, severe atopic
             dermatitis, sunburn, eczema, lesions of psoriasis in the area of realization of the
             prick test (risk of false positives).

          -  Subjects with viral infection activates the herpes simplex or herpes varicella-zoster
             in the area of realization of the prick test.

          -  Subjects that have some pathology in which the administration of adrenaline
             (hyperthyroidism, hypertension, heart disease, etc.) is contraindicated.
