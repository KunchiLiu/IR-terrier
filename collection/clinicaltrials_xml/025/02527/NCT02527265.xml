      Primary Objective:

      -To assess the safety and tolerability of Afrezza in children ages 4 to 17 years with type 1
      diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the ability to titrate the prandial and supplemental doses of Afrezza at each
           meal.

        -  To assess pharmacokinetics (PK) following a prandial dose of Afrezza in children ages 4
           to 17 years with T1DM.

      The patients are expected to participate in the study for approximately 6 to 8 weeks from
      Screening to final follow-up visit.

      Patients who completed 4 weeks of Afrezza treatment and have shown to be safe and well
      controlled with Afrezza + basal insulin will have the option to continue the extension
      treatment up to 1 year.
