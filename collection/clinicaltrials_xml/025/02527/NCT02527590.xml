  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stimuli used in the evoked potentials are electrical or laser. They are started and
      synchronized with the collection of the EEG by signals TTL (transistor-transistor logic).
      Investigators propose to validate a pneumatic stimulator delivering the compressed air sync
      with the EEG. It has two advantages over existing stimuli: Is capable of inducing in
      patients an allodynic response, excessive, painful, in response to a stimulation painless
      rarely obtained with laser or electrical stimuli. Therefore, the pneumatic stimulation is a
      means to study allodynic evoked potentials unknown to date.

      It must be possible with a single stimulator to explore non-painful sensations and allodynic
      sensation , compare them with one device. The differences are the abnormal responses. This
      validation assumes evoked potential recording 1. somatosensory (low stimulation) then 2.
      allodynic (only in patients). The study therefore provides for the registration 100
      potential for each of these two modalities in patients and only for the painless pneumatic
      modality in volunteers.

    <description>The latencies of allodynic evoked potentials (allodynic patients) and latencies of somesthetic evoked potentials (healthy volunteers). The mean of latencies somatosensory evoked potentials in healthy volunteers will be calculated with its confidence interval. Thus, for each patient allodynic if the latency of its response is not included in this confidence interval then his answer will be considered pathological.</description>
