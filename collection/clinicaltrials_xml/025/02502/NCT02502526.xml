  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the Centurion® Vision System used with the
      45° Balanced Tip will result in less Cumulative Dissipated Energy (CDE) than the lnfiniti®
      Vision System used with the 45° Mini-Flared Kelman (MFK) tip during cataract extraction
      surgery via phacoemulsification of cataract grades NII- NIV [Lens opacities classification
      system II (LOCSII)].

    <description>Cumulative Dissipated Energy (CDE) represents the energy dissipated of the u/s tip and infusion sleeve at the incision point (5.6mm back from the cutting edge of the tip) during the removal of cataractous lens. CDE will be reported on the Vision System interface and measured in percent-seconds. A lower CDE indicates that less energy was present at the incision site. This outcome measure is pre-specified for Centurion, Balanced Tip and Infiniti, MFK Tip.</description>

    <measure>Balanced Salt Solution (BSS) Fluid Used</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (operative day)</time_frame>
    <description>BSS Fluid will be measured by weighing the BSS bag after priming. BSS Used is Incision Leakage Fluid plus Aspiration Fluid Used. A reduction in BSS fluid used implies less induced trauma to tissues.</description>
