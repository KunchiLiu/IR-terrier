    <textblock>
      Opioid-dependent patients seeking maintenance treatment will be recruited. Each participant
      will be allocated to one of the two study groups with the equal chance of receiving either
      opium tincture or methadone. Participants, clinical and research staff will not be aware of
      the medication that each patient receives. This study aims to test whether opium tincture is
      equally effective as methadone at retaining participants with opioid dependence in
      substitution treatment.

      Purpose:

      To compare the efficacy and safety of opium tincture (OT) with methadone syrup for
      maintenance treatment of individuals with opioid-dependence.

      Justification:

      Currently, methadone is the gold standard for maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder.
      Opium tincture (OT) could be a potential new treatment alternative for opioid dependence
      disorder, and a promising solution to address the following issues:

        1. Alternative treatment option As no single treatment is effective for all individuals
           with opioid dependence, sufficiently diverse treatment options should be available.
           Currently, treatment options for opioid dependence is not always effective in
           addressing the addiction, neither after treatments which are offered based on clients'
           choice, nor even after the current gold standard substitution drug, methadone.

        2. Avoidance of overdose with methadone:

           The long-acting nature of methadone, its narrow therapeutic window, its high potency
           and associated lack of standard conversion ratio from and to other drugs, could result
           in fatal overdose. In contrast, OT has a shorter half-life and lower potency compared
           to methadone, which can account for a lower incidence of fatal overdose, especially in
           patients at higher risk of overdose with currently prescribed medications. Thus, OT
           could be an added treatment option to current available treatments such as
           Buprenorphine/ Naloxone for maintenance treatment of patients with higher risk of
           overdose.

        3. Prolonged QT syndrome of methadone:

           Maintenance treatment with methadone can cause serious, potentially fatal adverse
           effects on the cardiac electrical conduction system leading to a prolonged QT interval
           and predisposing patients to arrhythmias. As such, cardiac conduction co-morbidity is a
           (relative) contraindication for the use of methadone as a maintenance treatment. Thus,
           OT could be an added treatment option to current available treatments such as
           buprenorphine or levomethadone for maintenance treatment of patients with cardiac
           conduction defects.

        4. Opium dependence pattern of substance use To date, studies on maintenance treatment of
           opioid dependence have mostly been carried out on populations in which heroin is the
           predominant substance of use and there is comparatively fewer data on opium dependent
           patients. Opium tincture could be the treatment of choice in geographic areas with
           higher prevalence of opium dependence as the predominant pattern of substance use, such
           as Iran and some other Asian countries.

        5. Traditional medicine and cultural acceptance: Being a traditional herbal remedy for
           pain, opium tincture appears to be a more culturally acceptable alternative to
           methadone in some parts of Southeast Asia.

        6. Cost effectiveness: Possible cost effectiveness of OT for treatment of opioid use
           disorder can make it a potential treatment of choice if its efficacy and safety profile
           could be demonstrated through this RCT.

      Research methods:

      recruitment strategy: Following methods will be used to recruit participants: 1) Brochures
      and flyers will be distributed in community outreach, general and mental hospitals, NGO-run
      communities, colleges and universities, drop-in centers and specialized clinics for
      treatment of participants with HIV and hepatitis C 2) Posters (same content as a brochures
      and flyers) of the study will be stuck in the billboard of bus/subway, local stores,
      hospitals, NGO-run communities, colleges and universities, as well as any specialized
      health-care center for psychiatry or addiction treatments 3) there are two main NGO-run
      communities in Tehran for treating opiate dependent patients in Tehran. Investigators will
      use the initial contact letter to recruit from new patients attending these communities for
      receiving treatment.

      Sample size: Sample size calculation is based on non-inferiority design. In this study,
      investigators aim to evaluate if OT is no less effective in terms of retention (the primary
      outcome) than the gold standard, methadone. Previous clinical trials with methadone's 3-
      month retention rate as their primary outcome, demonstrated a rate of approximately 80%.
      Setting the type Ι error of 0.05 and power of 80% with clinically acceptable margin of 10%,
      the calculated sample size equals 100 participants in each treatment group. Considering a
      dropout rate of 20%, total sample size will be 240, 120 participants randomized to each
      group of the study. Statistical analysis plan: Retention in treatment will be compared
      between two groups using Fisher's exact test considering P value ≤ 0.05 as significant.
      Secondary outcomes will be compared between two groups using Fisher's exact test,
      independent samples T-test and One-way ANOVA test where applicable. Prediction of outcome
      variables will be based on generalized linear model and generalized estimating equations
      (GEE) model.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Opioid dependence as confirmed by DSM V diagnostic criteria

          -  Willingness and ability to adhere to study protocol and follow-up schedule as
             determined through the pre-randomization period

          -  Provide written informed consent.

          -  Females of childbearing capacity must agree to use an acceptable method of birth
             control approved by the study investigator throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active participant in another treatment program for opioid dependence within 14 days
             before inclusion in the study

          -  Severe hepatic impairment (decompensated liver disease), a contraindication for
             methadone and its potential to precipitate hepatic encephalopathy.

          -  Hypersensitivity to methadone syrup or other ingredients in the formulation

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Severe chronic respiratory disease

          -  Head injury and raised intracranial pressure: Respiratory depressant effects (with
             CO2 retention and secondary elevation of CSF pressure) may be markedly exaggerated in
             the presence of head injury, or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. May
             produce effects that obscure the clinical course in participants with head injuries.

          -  Biliary tract disease: may cause constriction of sphincter of Oddi.

          -  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors use within 14 days of the study
