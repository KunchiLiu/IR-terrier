    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of
      partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep, leading to pauses of
      breathing and arousals. Although previously considered as a local abnormality of the
      respiratory track, it is nowadays recognized as a systemic disease and an important cause of
      morbidity and mortality, since it is strongly associated with obesity (especially abdominal
      obesity) and cardiometabolic diseases, including the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular
      diseases and diabetes mellitus. The modification of lifestyle habits, e.g. in terms of diet
      and physical activity, is currently explored as a mean of managing the disease in
      combination with the first line treatment, i.e., the application of continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep. The available data support that weight loss, achieved
      through lifestyle modification, effectively reduces the severity of OSA and improves the
      associated cardiometabolic disorders in overweight or obese patients. However, studies
      exploring the potential effect of diet's quality or other lifestyle habits (such as physical
      activity) on OSA severity, besides weight loss, are currently lacking. Given that a
      Mediterranean dietary pattern as well as other lifestyle habits adopted by the populations
      in the Mediterranean region have been proven beneficial both for the prevention and the
      resolution of the metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiometabolic diseases, the aim of
      the present randomized, controlled, single-blind study is to implement an intensive 6-month
      intervention based on the Mediterranean lifestyle (hypocaloric diet and 7 group lifestyle
      counselling sessions) and to evaluate its potential benefits, compared with standard care
      (hypocaloric diet and written advice for healthy lifestyle), in a sample of patients with
      OSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent complete or
      partial interruptions of breathing during sleep due to obstruction of the upper airways,
      which leads to disturbances in gas exchange, hypoxia and consequent arousals. Beyond its
      adverse impact on sleep duration, sleep quality, as well as the functionality and cognitive
      function during the day (typical symptoms include fatigue, sleepiness, decreased reflexes,
      impaired memory, etc.). OSA is currently recognized as a major cause of morbidity and
      mortality due to its strong association with obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, including
      the metabolic syndrome (and its individual components, namely abdominal adiposity, impaired
      fasting glucose, dyslipidaemia and hypertension), cardiovascular diseases and diabetes
      mellitus. According to epidemiological data, its prevalence ranges from 2% to 7% in the
      general population (with a clear lead of obese middle-aged men), however it is estimated
      that a large proportion of patients (70-80%) remain undiagnosed making the disease a major
      public health challenge for the 21st century. Currently, the first line treatment for the
      management of moderate-to-severe OSA or mild OSA accompanied by symptoms (such as daytime
      sleepiness and cognitive disorders) and other diseases (such as hypertension and heart
      disease) is the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep,
      usually via a renal mask. CPAP has been proven effective in alleviating the symptoms of the
      disease (e.g. pauses of breathing during sleep and daytime sleepiness), however it is also
      characterized by high rates of non-compliance and its effectiveness in improving
      cardiometabolic indices has not yet been confirmed.

      Given the strong relationship of OSA with obesity and its concomitant metabolic disorders,
      as well as the aforementioned restrictions of the use of CPAP as the sole treatment for the
      disease, lifestyle changes have currently emerged as a promising treatment for OSA. Indeed,
      several interventional studies have investigated the effect of lifestyle changes on the
      treatment of OSA, focusing primarily on weight loss - achieved through a hypocaloric diet,
      either solely or in combination with exercise and lifestyle counselling - and the available
      data support its effectiveness in reducing the severity of the disease and improving its
      associated cardiometabolic disorders in overweight patients. However, studies exploring the
      potential effect of diet's quality or other lifestyle habits (such as physical activity) on
      OSA severity and associated disorders, besides weight loss, are currently lacking. Given
      that a Mediterranean dietary pattern as well as other lifestyle habits adopted by the
      populations in the Mediterranean region (e.g. consumption of seasonal, traditional and
      eco-friendly food products, regular physical activity, adequate rest during the day, etc.)
      have been proven beneficial both for the prevention and the resolution of the metabolic
      syndrome and its associated cardiometabolic diseases, the aim of the present study is to
      implement an intervention based on the Mediterranean lifestyle and to evaluate its potential
      beneficial effect on biochemical and clinical characteristics of a sample of patients with
      OSA, compared with standard care.

      This study will be a randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial. The study sample
      will consist of adult (18-65 year old), overweight or obese (Body Mass Index &gt; 25 kg/m2)
      patients with moderate or severe OSA (Apnea Hypopnea Index &gt; 15) confirmed through
      polysomnography at the Center of Sleep Disorders of the 1st Department of Critical Care and
      Pulmonary Services of &quot;Evaggelismos&quot; General Hospital of Athens. At baseline, patients will
      be informed in detail about the study and will give their written consent. Then, subjects
      will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: (a) the control group, receiving a hypocaloric
      diet (1500 kcal/d for women and 1800 kcal/d for men) and written general advice for a
      healthy lifestyle and (b) the Mediterranean lifestyle group, receiving a hypocaloric diet
      (1500 kcal/d for women and 1800 kcal/d for men) and attending a comprehensive lifestyle
      intervention, comprising 7 60-min group counselling sessions, conducted every two weeks for
      the first 2 months and every month for the following 4 months until the end of the 6-month
      intervention. In the Mediterranean lifestyle group, all food groups of the Mediterranean
      diet will be targeted according to the pattern proposed in the Mediterranean diet pyramid
      (e.g. increase in the consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, decrease in the
      consumption of red meat and sweets, preference in olive oil as the main source of dietary
      fat), while beneficial culinary practices, seasonality and locality of food products
      consumed, adequate rest during the day, as well as the adoption of a physically active
      lifestyle will be additionally addressed. Lifestyle counselling will be based on the goal
      setting theory, while motivational and behavioural strategies will also be used. The
      lifestyle intervention will also aim at achieving a 5-10% weight loss within the first 6
      months. The dietary intervention and monitoring will be carried out in the laboratory of
      Clinical Nutrition &amp; Dietetics at Harokopio University, where experienced clinical
      dietitians will conduct all consultations.

      The assessment of patients' clinical, laboratory and lifestyle characteristics will be
      performed at baseline, at the end of the 6-month intervention and 1 year after the study
      entry at the Center of Sleep Disorders of the 1st Department of Critical Care and Pulmonary
      Services of &quot;Evaggelismos&quot; General Hospital of Athens. The evaluation will include: 1) brief
      medical history assessment, 2) assessment of the severity of the disease through
      polysomnography, 3) evaluation of insomnia through the Athens Insomnia Scale, 4) assessment
      of daytime sleepiness through the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 5) evaluation of the quality of
      life through the SF-36 questionnaire, 6) dietary assessment through a semiquantitative food
      frequency questionnaire (data from the food frequency questionnaire will be used to evaluate
      participants' food group and individual food and beverage consumption, as well as their
      adherence to the Mediterranean diet through the Mediterranean Diet Score) and 24-hour
      dietary recalls (data from the 24-h dietary recalls will be analysed in terms of energy,
      macro- and micronutrient intake using the Nutritionist Pro, version 2.2 software, as well as
      of meal frequency and patterns), 7) physical activity assessment through the International
      Physical Activity Questionnaire, 8) anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and
      hip circumference), 9) blood pressure measurement and 10) fasting blood sample and urine
      sample collection for laboratory measurements (lipid profile, markers of glucose metabolism,
      markers of liver function, inflammatory markers, markers of oxidative stress, etc.) using
      automated analysers and/or commercial ELISA kits.
