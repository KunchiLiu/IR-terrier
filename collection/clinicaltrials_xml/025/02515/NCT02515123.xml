  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early enteral feeding is a key component of the management of critically ill patients
      receiving mechanical ventilation. However, enteral feeding has been associated with serious
      complications such as gastro-esophageal reflux, with both overt and micro pulmonary
      aspiration, which potentially increases the risk to nosocomial pneumonia. Many critically
      ill patients experience poor tolerance of early enteral nutrition because of impaired
      gastric motility, which leads to a sequence of delayed gastric emptying, increased gastric
      volume, gastro esophageal reflux, vomiting, aspiration, and VAP. Early and adequate enteral
      feeding in ICU patients is correlated with decreased overall infections rates, ventilator
      and intensive care unit (ICU) days, costs, and mortality.

      This study is intended to assess the efficacy and safety of the E-Motion System (i.e.
      E-Motion tubeTM and E-Motion EPG 1000TM) in improving tolerance to enteral nutrition by
      inducing esophageal motion by means of electrical stimulation in ICU patients.

    <textblock>
      Malnutrition in the ICU is a known cause for increased morbidity and mortality and providing
      artificial nutrition is part of standard care in ICUs worldwide. While malnutrition is a
      risk factor for adverse outcomes related to critical illness, what is more difficult to
      prove is the value of optimal amounts of nutrition. Nevertheless, large-scale observational
      studies of critically ill patients suggest that optimal amounts and timely provision of
      nutritional intake is associated with reduced infectious complications, duration of
      mechanical ventilation, and mortality, along with perceptions of faster physical recovery.
      Smaller RCTs demonstrate that greater nutrition intake is associated with improved weaning
      from mechanical ventilation while larger RCTs do suggest non-significant improvements in
      long-term physical functional performance (6 minute walk test at 12 months) and a
      significant improvement in 60-day quality of life. In contrast, there are large-scale RCTs
      that fail to demonstrate a positive treatment effect of enhanced nutritional intake.
      However, these trials have been criticized for study heterogeneous groups of low
      'nutritional-risk' patients. Patients who benefit the most from optimal nutritional
      supplementation are high-nutritional risk. Recent data suggests that tolerating 80% of the
      prescribed amounts of protein and calories is associated with improved clinical outcome and
      may serve as a quality indicator for ICU practice. Currently, around the world, more than
      75% of nutritionally-high risk patients are systematically underfed receiving less than 80%
      of prescribed amounts. Thus, the investigators conclude that greater efforts to improve
      nutrition intake in ICU patients are warranted.

      Early enteral nutrition (EN) is supported by mechanistic data delineating its physiologic
      effects, which provide both non-nutritional and nutritional benefits to the critically ill
      patient. EN should be started as soon as possible following admission to the ICU in order to
      achieve the non-nutritional benefits and minimize the development of a protein-calorie
      deficit that frequently occurs during the first week of critical illness. The
      non-nutritional benefits are derived from several physiologic mechanisms that maintain
      structural and functional gut integrity, preventing increases in intestinal permeability.
      Immune mechanisms elicited by EN result in attenuation of oxidative stress and the
      inflammatory response while supporting the humoral immune system. Enteral feeding modulates
      metabolic responses that help decrease insulin resistance. The nutritional benefits are
      derived from delivery of exogenous nutrients, which provide sufficient protein and calories,
      deliver micronutrients and antioxidants, and maintain lean body mass.

      Because many factors impede delivery of early EN in the ICU setting, patients routinely get
      approximately 50% of the calories and protein that are required. Our mission, at E-Motion
      Medical, is to improve outcome for critically ill patients by lowering their risk of
      infection and enabling them to have better nutritional intake. To achieve that, novel
      technology was developed that reduces gastric reflux and promotes GI motility, via electric
      stimulation to the esophageal mucosa. The investigators believe our technology will improve
      gastric emptying, reduce reflux and aspiration of gastric content, and enable more adequate
      delivery of enteral nutrition to critically-ill patients predisposed to delayed gastric
      emptying.

By applying predetermined sequences of electrical stimulation to various locations along the esophagus asynchronous esophageal motion is induced, resulting is reduction of reflux and increased GI motility, enabling safer and better feeding.</description>

    <description>The sham EPG will resemble the investigational EPG. The external shape, interface, lights, and switches will be exactly the same. The Sham device will emit a low intensity pulsation so that, it will not unblind the patient nor health care professional. In the event that unblinding does occur, we will take steps to mask the identity of the EPG by covering the number of the device with tape to prevent members of the clinical team becoming aware of which device is active or sham.</description>
