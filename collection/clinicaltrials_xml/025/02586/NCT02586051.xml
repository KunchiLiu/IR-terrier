  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label study of single and repeat doses of obinutuzumab administered
      as intravenous (IV) infusion in adults with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Participants
      will be enrolled into two cohorts receiving either one (Cohort 1) or two or more (Cohort 2)
      obinutuzumab infusions. Both cohorts will receive standard pretreatments to reduce the risk
      of infusion-related reactions (IRRs). In Cohort 1, 5 participants will receive single dose
      obinutuzumab IV infusion on Day 1. Following review of Cohort 1 aggregated safety data up to
      4 weeks post dose for the last participant of cohort 1, cohort 2 will be allowed to proceed.
      In Cohort 2, 20 participants will receive obinutuzumab IV infusion on Days 1 and 15.
      Participants who qualify for transplantation and receive a compatible kidney offer after
      inclusion in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 will receive two additional infusions (one at the time of
      transplantation and second at Week 24 post-transplantation) of obinutuzumab. Assessment of
      the safety and tolerability of the obinutuzumab regimen will be conducted at Week 24 of the
      desensitization phase and at Week 28 post-transplantation. All participants will be
      monitored for a minimum of 12 months following the last obinutuzumab infusion.
