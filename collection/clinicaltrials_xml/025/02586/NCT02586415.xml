    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the hypothesis that FDA cleared thrombectomy devices plus
      medical management leads to superior clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients at
      90 days when compared to medical management alone in appropriately selected subjects with
      the Target mismatch profile and an MCA (M1 segment) or ICA occlusion who can be randomized
      and have endovascular treatment initiated between 6-16 hours after last seen well.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DEFUSE 3 is a prospective randomized Phase III multicenter controlled trial of patients with
      acute ischemic anterior circulation strokes due to large artery occlusion treated between
      6-16 hours of stroke onset with endovascular thrombectomy therapy vs. control.

      The primary endpoint, the modified Rankin Score, will be assessed at 3 months. The patients'
      participation in the study concludes at that time (3 months from stroke onset). The study
      will randomize up to 476 patients over 4 years. The purpose of DEFUSE 3 is to assess the
      safety and efficacy of thrombectomy in carefully selected patients in an extended time
      window. Only the devices listed in this protocol will be used. Selection of the specific
      device (or devices) is determined by the individual endovascular therapist.

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will undergo either CT Perfusion/CT Angiogram or MR
      DWI/PWI/MRA studies prior to randomization. Patients who have evidence of an ICA or MCA M1
      occlusion and a Target Mismatch Profile will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with
      one or more DEFUSE 3 approved thrombectomy devices (only the devices listed in this protocol
      are approved for use in DEFUSE 3) plus standard medical therapy versus standard medical
      therapy alone. Patients who are enrolled, but not randomized, will receive standard therapy
      according to local guidelines. Baseline data, and information about early stroke therapies,
      will be captured for this group of patients.

      Randomization of a maximum of 476 patients is planned. A novel adaptive design will
      identify, at interim analyses, the group with the best prospect for showing benefit from
      endovascular treatment, based on baseline core lesion volumes and the times since stroke
      onset. Interim analyses will be conducted at 200 and 340 patients, at which time the study
      may stop for efficacy/futility, or the inclusion criteria may be adjusted in the case of
      futility.

    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale runs from 0-6 with &quot;0&quot; being perfect health without symptoms to &quot;6&quot; being death. 0 - No symptoms.
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
- Dead.</description>
