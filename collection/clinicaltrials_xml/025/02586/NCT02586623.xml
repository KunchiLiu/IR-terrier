      To evaluate the time to treatment intervention in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD),
      Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Pure Autonomic Failure (PAF), Non-Diabetic Autonomic
      Neuropathy (NDAN) or Dopamine Beta Hydroxylase (DBH) Deficiency who have been previously
      stabilized with droxidopa therapy for symptoms of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH)
      (dizziness, light-headedness, or feelings that they are about to black out)

    <description>Need for intervention is defined as meeting ANY of the following criteria during the Double-Blind Period:
Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment (OHSA) Item #1 ≥2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) AND lack of efficacy as judged by the investigator; OR
OHSA Item #1 ≥2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) at 2 consecutive visits; OR
OHSA Item #1 ≥2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) at the visit before early discontinuation; OR
Patient stops IMP or withdraws from study for patient-reported lack of efficacy.
The timing of the need for intervention in the above criteria is defined as the first occurrence of a worsening of OHSA Item #1 by ≥ 2 units or when the patient stops taking IMP or withdraws due to a patient-reported lack of efficacy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or older and able to stand (with or without limited assistance)

          -  Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension associated with Primary
             Autonomic Failure (PD, MSA or PAF) or NDAN or DBH Deficiency

          -  Score of at least 4 or greater on Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment (OHSA)
             Item #1 (measured at Screening [Visit 1] and the first Titration Visit [Visit 2a]
             prior to dosing)

          -  A documented drop of at least 20 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) in SBP, within 3
             minutes of standing. This can either be documented in the patient history or assessed
             during Screening prior to the first Titration Visit (Visit 2a)

        Additional inclusion criteria for patients taking prescribed droxidopa prior to study
        entry:

        Patients who are taking prescribed droxidopa therapy are eligible to participate in the
        study if they meet the other inclusion criteria and also have been on a stable dose of
        prescribed droxidopa for at least 2 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1). In
        addition, they must meet either of the following at the Screening Visit (Visit 1):

          -  The patient's Visit 1 OHSA Item #1 score is ≥ 7 AND the prescribed dose is ≤ 300 mg
             three times daily (TID); OR

          -  The patient's Visit 1 OHSA Item #1 score is ≤6 AND worsens by ≥ 2 units when retested

             diastolic. Sustained is defined as the average of 3 observations each at least 10
             minutes apart with the patient having been supine and at rest for at least 5 minutes
             prior to each measurement.

          -  Untreated closed angle glaucoma

          -  Diagnosis of hypertension that requires treatment with antihypertensive medications
             (short-acting antihypertensives to treat nocturnal supine hypertension are allowed in
