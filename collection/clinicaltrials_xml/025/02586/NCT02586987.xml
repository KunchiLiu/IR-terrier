      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-centre, drug combination study of double and triple
      combination oral selumetinib (AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate) plus intravenous (IV) MEDI4736 and oral
      selumetinib plus IV MEDI4736 and IV tremelimumab in patients with advanced solid tumours.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-centre, drug combination study of double and triple
      combination oral selumetinib (AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate) plus intravenous (IV) MEDI4736 and oral
      selumetinib plus IV MEDI4736 and IV tremelimumab in patients with advanced solid tumours
      refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. The safety,
      tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumour activity of ascending doses of Selumetinib
      (AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate) in Combination with MEDI4736 and Selumetinib in Combination with
      MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab will be investigated. Once safety and tolerability have been
      established for the relevant dose, expansion cohorts will commence in order to further
      evaluate safety, tolerability, and provide a preliminary evaluation of the mechanism of
      action and anti-tumour activity of the drug combination. Mandatory paired biopsy expansion
      cohorts will be tumour-type specific. Expansion cohorts will open independently for double
      and triple combination treatments.

               -  Haemoglobin &lt;90 g/L

               -  Alanine aminotransferase &gt;2.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) if no demonstrable

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase &gt;2.5 x ULN if no demonstrable liver metastases or &gt;5
                  times ULN in the presence of liver metastases

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN. This will not apply to patients with confirmed
                  Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinaemia [predominantly
                  unconjugated bilirubin] in the absence of evidence of haemolysis or hepatic
                  pathology), who will be allowed in consultation with their physician

               -  Creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min (calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation).
                  Confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is &gt;1.5
                  times ULN.

         13. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic GI diseases, inability to swallow the
             formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude
             adequate absorption of selumetinib

         14. History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of MEDI4736 or
             selumetinib or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to MEDI4736 or
             selumetinib

         15. Judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and
             requirements

         16. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both AZ staff or
             staff at the study site)

         17. Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant

         18. Body weight &lt;30 kg

        In addition, the following is considered a criterion for exclusion from the optional
        exploratory host genetic research:

        -Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion within 120 days of the date of the genetic
        sample collection
