  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is two-fold: 1) To study risk factors for the development of
      postpartum depression, including cognitive factors (i.e., perseverative negative thinking
      and interpretation of infant facial expressions), and other factors such as negative
      childhood experiences, parental attachment, parental stress and previous psychopathology. 2)
      Investigate the effect of The Newborn Behavioral Observation (NBO) as a universal prevention
      intervention implemented at well-baby clinics in Tromsø with regard to parental mental
      health, parent-infant interaction and child development.

      This is a longitudinal observational study with an intervention. The observational part of
      the study will use a prospective cohort design. To compare an intervention group receiving
      The Newborn Behavioral Observation (NBO) with a control group receiving standard health care
      the investigators will use a non-randomized cluster controlled design, since neither cluster
      randomization, nor randomization at the individual level is feasible in the routine practice
      setting. Parents with infants belonging to two well-baby clinics in Tromsø, Norway will be
      offered the NBO intervention. Parents and infants belonging to the rest of the well-baby
      clinics in the municipality of Tromsø will receive standard health care, i.e. treatment as
      usual and constitute the control group.

      Participants will be recruited by midwifes at the Midwife Center and by general
      practitioners (GPs) in the municipality of Tromsø. Midwifes and GPs will be informed of the
      project by the research group. The participants will be recruited in (approximately) week 16
      of gestation, when they have their first visit at the Midwife Center, or earlier in their
      first trimester by their GP. At recruitment the parents will be informed that most of them
      will receive standard health care after delivery, and that some will be given a new
      consultations method for public health nurses. All pregnant women and expecting fathers who
      speak Norwegian are eligible for inclusion in the study.

      Based on the experiences from a comparable study, &quot;Little in Norway&quot;, the investigators
      expect that about 25 % of all pregnant women (and expecting fathers) in the municipality of
      Tromsø will participate in the specified time period, i.e. about 500 families in total.

      For the observational part of the study, assessments will be performed at five time points:
      The first assessment is at week 16 - 22 of gestation, the second at week 24 - 30 of
      gestation, the third at about week 31 of gestation, the fourth 6 weeks post-delivery and the
      fifth 4 months post-delivery. For the intervention study pre-intervention measures will take
      place at about week 31 of gestation, post-intervention measures at 6 weeks post-delivery and
      follow-up measures at 4 months and 6 months post-delivery. In addition, parents will be
      asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding their experiences with the intervention after
      each of the three NBO consultations. Also, after each of the NBO consultations, the health
      worker conducting the intervention fills out a form about their judgment of the infant along
      four dimensions: autonomic, motor, state organization and attentional-interactional.

      The data will be collected on questionnaires administered over the Internet. The researcher
      will contact the parents and ask them to complete the measures over the Internet. The
      exception is the NBO questionnaires mentioned above which will be completed in conjunction
      with the NBO consultations, and The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 6 weeks
      post-delivery which will be collected by the public health nurse using the paper-and- pencil
      version at the well- baby clinic as a part of routine practice. Also the researcher will
      meet the families at week 16 of gestation for inclusion, 6 weeks and 4 and 6 months
      post-delivery.

    <description>The Newborn Behavioral Observation (NBO) is a flexible parental guidance methodology which takes between 20 and 40 minutes to administer. It consists of 18 neurobehavioral observations which give a profile of the infant´s behavioral repertoire along the dimensions: attentional-interactional, autonomic, motor and state organization.
The intervention group will receive 3 NBO consultations: 1) Routine care plus the NBO at the hospital within two days post-delivery; 2) Routine home visit plus the NBO by a public health nurse when the infant is 7-10 days old; and 3) NBO at the well-baby clinic when the infant is about 4 weeks old.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive routine care. Between 7 and 10 days after birth a public health nurse routinely visits the family at home. Six weeks after birth, the mother and the infant visit the well-baby clinic</description>
