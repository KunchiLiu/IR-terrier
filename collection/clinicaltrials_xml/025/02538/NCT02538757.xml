      The VaricElla zosteR VaccinE (VERVE) trial evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the
      herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine, Zostavax, in arthritis patients over 50 years old who are
      using anti-TNF therapy and who have not previously received the vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as &quot;shingles&quot;, is caused by reactivation and multiplication
      of the ubiquitous varicella zoster virus (VZV) that remains latent in everyone's sensory
      neurons following varicella, or &quot;chickenpox&quot;. Among individuals who live to age 85, the
      lifetime risk for HZ is 50%, and more than one in five individuals affected by zoster
      develop post-herpetic neuralgia, resulting in chronic pain. Other serious complications
      include encephalitis, permanent vision loss, or more rarely, dissemination and death.
      Fortunately, a live attenuated vaccine is available and can reduce HZ risk by up to 70%. For
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this vaccine has great potential to provide
      improved quality of life by reducing the incidence and complications associated with zoster.
      Due to the underlying disease and/or treatments (e.g. steroids) for rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA), the risk of herpes zoster in RA patients is approximately double in the general
      population. This increased risk should make prevention of zoster and vaccination exceedingly
      important for RA patients. In fact, because of a higher overall absolute risk for zoster in
      RA, the vaccine yields a comparable or even greater absolute risk reduction to reduce the
      risk of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia in an RA population as it does in the general
      population. However, the use of the zoster vaccine in RA patients is very low (&lt; 5%), and
      less frequently used than for the general population.

      National guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory
      Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend a single dose of the zoster vaccine for
      all individuals age 60 or older, with the vaccine more recently gaining FDA-approval for
      administration to persons age 50 and older. While a large number of RA patients would
      otherwise be recommended to receive this vaccine on the basis of age, theoretical safety
      concerns related to vaccination likely explain the very low vaccination rates observed.
      Currently, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), the ACIP, and the American College of
      Rheumatology (ACR) consider the live zoster vaccine contraindicated in patients receiving
      immunosuppressive medications, such as biologic therapies. Such contraindication stems from
      the theoretical safety concern that these individuals could develop a varicella-like
      infection from the vaccine virus strain. However, investigators hypothesize that this
      vaccine can safely be given in this setting, as no published data is available to suggest
      that these safety concerns are warranted. A growing body of observational data suggests that
      vaccinating RA patients receiving biologic therapies with this vaccine may in fact be safe.
      Moreover, and similarly with little or no evidence, the ACIP considers the vaccine safe and
      acceptable for patients using methotrexate at doses commonly used to treat RA (e.g. &lt;= 25
      mg/week) and for patients using glucocorticoids at prednisone-equivalent doses of ≤ 20
      mg/day.

      In light of 1) a substantial elevated HZ risk among RA patients; 2) national data showing
      most RA patients are not vaccinated for HZ; and 3) the high effectiveness of this vaccine in
      the general population, the investigators propose to conduct the Varicella zostER VaccinE
      (VERVE) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and long-term effectiveness of the live herpes zoster vaccine. This pilot
      study will recruit the first 125 patients of the needed 1,000 individuals age 50 years or
      older currently receiving anti-TNF therapy for RA or other inflammatory arthritis. Within a
      relevant 6-week safety window, the investigators will collect serious adverse events
      (satisfying a regulatory definition of a SAE) including non-serious events of vaccine-strain
      varicella-like infection or herpes zoster. Beyond the key public health importance of the
      clinical question addressed, clinical trial methodological innovations anticipated for this
      unique large pragmatic trial. Additionally, the investigators will study vaccine
      tolerability and long-term effectiveness through a linkage to health plan data to allow for
      cost-effective follow-up while minimizing participant and study-site burden. Results from
      this pilot study will facilitate the parent trial and change RA management by demonstrating
      the clinical safety and immunogenicity of the live zoster vaccine among current anti-TNF
      users. Rheumatologists and other providers will be able to improve the care, outcomes, and
      quality of life for RA patients, substantially decreasing the morbidity of herpes zoster and
      its complications over a lifetime.

    <description>Incident HZ cases occurring up to 2 years following vaccination and beyond will be ascertained among enrollees in Medicare and/or a large commercial health plan using a novel linkage to administrative health plan data. We will examine longer-term reduction in risk for herpes zoster and the potential for decreased vaccine effectiveness over time to prevent HZ, which might suggest waning immunity and the need for re-vaccination. This outcome will be ascertained using administrative claims data among the majority of VERVE participants who are linkable to the health plan data sources available to the trial.</description>

    <description>Serious adverse events of interest will include all serious adverse events that satisfy the FDA-accepted definition of SAEs (results in death, life threatening, results in or prolongs hospitalization, etc.). The hypothesis to be tested by the trial is that vaccination with Zostavax® is non-inferior to placebo injection in the cumulative incidence of the composite safety outcome occurring within 42 days after vaccination. We will also examine vaccine tolerability including injection site reactions and flares in RA disease activity within 6 weeks following vaccination. RA disease activity will be measured using the clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and the Rapid Assessment of Patient Data (RAPID3)</description>
