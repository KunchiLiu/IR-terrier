  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to

      • Investigate the relative bioavailability of sorafenib as 400 mg (4 x 100 mg) tablet for
      oral suspension formulation in comparison to 400 mg (2 x 200 mg) marketed tablet
      formulation.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to

        -  Evaluate the dose proportionality in sorafenib pharmacokinetics for sorafenib tablet
           for oral suspension formulation after administration of 200 mg (2 x 100 mg) and 400 mg
           (4 x 100 mg) dose of sorafenib in fasted state

        -  Evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the tablet for oral suspension
           formulation after administration of a single dose of 400 mg sorafenib (4 x 100mg)

        -  Evaluate the taste and palatability of sorafenib (both formulations)

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of sorafenib tablet for oral suspension in healthy
           male subjects

          -  Laboratory examination:

               -  Clinically relevant deviations of the screened laboratory parameters from
