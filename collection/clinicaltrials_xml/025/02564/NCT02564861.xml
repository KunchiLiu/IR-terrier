        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 years to 65 years.

          -  A body mass index (BMI) in the range 18 kg/m2 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive, and weighing
             between 50 kg and 100 kg, inclusive at screening. BMI is calculated as weight
             [kg]/(height [m])2.

          -  Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential as follows:

               -  Must be postmenopausal (the last menstrual period was at least 12 months before
                  Screening, and a follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] test at Screening confirms
                  postmenopausal status); or

               -  Must be surgically sterile having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and/or bilateral tubal ligation.

          -  Willing to comply with all study restrictions, including the use of contraception,
             concomitant medication, and dietary and lifestyle restrictions.

          -  Sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the study and any hazards of
             participating in it. Ability to communicate satisfactorily with the Investigator and
             to participate in, and comply with requirements of, the entire study.

          -  Have given written consent to participate in the study after reading the ICF, and
             after having the opportunity to discuss the study with the Investigator or his
             delegate.

          -  Have given written consent to have his/her data entered into The Over volunteering
             Prevention System.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG findings, or laboratory
             values that could interfere with the objectives of the study or compromise the safety
             of the subject.

          -  Presence or history of acute or chronic illness, including (but not limited to) liver
             or kidney disease, hypertension, seizures, or any known impairment of endocrine, or
             other specific body-organ dysfunction.

          -  History of serious reaction to any medicine.

          -  Presence or history of malignant disease.

          -  Acute or chronic infectious disease, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
             hepatitis B virus (HBV) or C virus (HCV) infection.

          -  Surgery (eg, stomach bypass) or medical condition that might affect how the body
             handles or absorbs medicines.

          -  Significant illness within 4 weeks before the first dose of study medication.

          -  Participation in another clinical study of a new chemical entity or a prescription
             medicine within the previous 3 months, or unwilling to abstain from participating in
             other clinical trials during the study and for 3 months after receipt of study
             medication.

          -  Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in semi-supine position at the Screening
             examination outside the ranges 90 mmHg to 140 mmHg systolic, 40 mmHg to 90 mmHg
             diastolic; heart rate &lt; 40 beats/min to &gt; 100 beats/min. Subjects with Stage 1
             hypertension (systolic 140 mmHg to 160 mmHg; diastolic 90 mmHg to 100 mmHg) may be
             enrolled provided they do not have evidence of end-organ damage, diabetes or a 10
             year cardiovascular risk &gt; 20%.

          -  Abnormal ECG waveform morphology at Screening that would preclude accurate
             measurement of the uncorrected QT interval (QT) duration.

          -  QT interval for heart rate corrected using QTcF interval duration &gt; 430 ms for men or
             &gt; 450 ms for women, obtained as an average from the measurements on duplicate
             Screening ECGs over a brief recording period.

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73m2 (based on Modification
             of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation) or an absolute creatinine value outside the
             normal range.

          -  Use of any prescription or over the counter (OTC) medications, or herbal remedies
             (such as St John's wort), known to be strong inhibitors or strong inducers of
             cytochrome (CYP) enzymes (also known as CYP P450 enzymes) during the 30 days before
             the first dose of study medication; use of any other prescription or OTC medicine
             (with the exception of acetaminophen (paracetamol)), including dietary supplements or
             herbal remedies, during the 7 days before the dose of study medication.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Consumption of certain foods or beverages before the first dose and throughout the
             study period.

          -  Loss of more than 400 mL blood or donation of blood, plasma, platelets, or any other
             blood components during the 3 months before the first dose of study medication, or
             unwilling to abstain from doing so during the study and for 3 months after receipt of
             study medication.

          -  Abuse of drugs or alcohol during the 2 years before the first dose of study
             medication, or intake of more than 21 units of alcohol weekly for male subjects and
             14 units of alcohol weekly for female subjects.

          -  Use of tobacco products or nicotine-containing products during the 3 months before
             the first dose of study medication and during the study.

          -  Evidence of drug or alcohol abuse at screening or admission.

          -  Likely possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the
             protocol.

          -  Objection by General Practitioner (GP) to the volunteer entering the study.
