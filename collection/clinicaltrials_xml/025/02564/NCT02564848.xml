    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be female age 70 or older and have a diagnosis of clinical T1-2N0 ER+
      invasive breast cancer. Patients will undergo standard of care lumpectomy without sentinel
      node biopsy followed by radiation and hormonal therapy.

      Sentinel node biopsy is also considered standard care when patients have localized breast
      cancer. Treatment can often be influenced by whether the results of the biopsy show cancer
      or not. However, the biologic factors of the primary tumor have become more important in
      determining treatment recommendations in women with estrogen receptor positive breast
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether omission of sentinel node biopsy
      in patients who meet eligibility criteria results in an acceptable regional recurrence rate
      over a 4 year period. A regional recurrence is defined as any recurrence in the ipsilateral
      axillary nodes, supraclavicular nodes or internal mammary nodes.

      Secondary objectives of the study include determining the disease-free survival and overall
      survival in patients who meet eligibility criteria and have had sentinel node biopsy omitted
      from their surgical treatment.

      After surgery, a patient will receive standard of care radiation and hormonal therapy on her
      affected breast. She may also receive chemotherapy as determined by her treating physician.
      A physical examination of the affected breast and regional lymph nodes will be conducted
      every six months for the first two years of follow up and then yearly for the last 3 years
      of follow up. Imaging of the affected breast will occur every 12 months after surgery per
      standard of care.
