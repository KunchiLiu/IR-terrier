    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of three
      heterologous prime-boost regimens for Ebola vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo. The study
      will include healthy adults and elderly participants, HIV infected adults, healthy
      adolescents, children and young children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, Phase
      2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 3 heterologous prime-boost
      regimens using Ad26.ZEBOV as prime and MVA-BN-Filo as boost vaccination, administered at
      28-, 56- and 84-day (Group 1, 2 and 3 as above) intervals, in healthy and elderly
      participants. A 28- and 56-day (Groups 1 and 2, as above) schedule will be evaluated in
      HIV-infected participants and in children. The study consists of a screening phase of up to
      8 weeks, a vaccination phase in which participants will be vaccinated at baseline (Day 1)
      followed by a boost vaccination on Day 29, 57 or 85, a post-vaccination phase and long-term
      follow-up phase until Day 365. All participants within a cohort will be followed in a
      blinded manner by the site until the last subject in that cohort has completed the study.
      This study will be conducted in Africa and the enrollment will take place sequentially in
      four cohorts: the first cohort will consist of healthy participants (18 - 70 years); the
      second cohort (2a) will include HIV-infected participants (18 to 50 years) and healthy
      children 12 to 17 years (cohort 2b); the third cohort will include children aged 4 to 11
      years inclusive and in the fourth cohort young children aged 1 to 3 years will be enrolled.
      Within each cohort, participants will be randomized in a 5:1 ratio to receive active vaccine
      versus placebo. Safety evaluations will include assessments of adverse events, an
      electrocardiogram (ECG) for adult participants at screening, physical examination, vital
      signs (blood pressure, pulse/heart rate, body temperature), clinical laboratory and
      pregnancy testing. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be established to
      monitor data on a regular basis to ensure the continuing safety of the participants enrolled
      in the study.
