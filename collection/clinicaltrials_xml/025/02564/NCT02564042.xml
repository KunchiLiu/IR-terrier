    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of two concentrations (0.5 percent [%] and
      1%) and two application frequencies (once a day and twice a day) of GSK2894512 cream for the
      topical treatment in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Results from this study will be
      considered when selecting the most appropriate concentration of GSK2894512 cream and dosing
      frequency in future clinical safety and efficacy studies. This is a multicenter (United
      States, Canada, and Japan), randomized, double-blind (sponsor-unblind), vehicle-controlled,
      6-arm, parallel-group, dose-finding study. Two concentrations of GSK2894512 cream (0.5% and
      1%) and a vehicle control cream will be equally randomized and evaluated following
      application to all psoriasis lesions (except on the scalp) once daily (evening) or twice
      daily (morning and evening) for 12 weeks. This study will consist of 3 periods: up to 4
      weeks screening, 12 weeks double-blind treatment, and 4 weeks post-treatment follow-up. The
      total duration of subject participation will be approximately 16 to 20 weeks. Approximately
      270 adult males and females subjects with plaque psoriasis will be screened in order to have
      at least 228 randomized subjects (38 subjects for each of the 6 treatment groups) and
      approximately 204 evaluable subjects overall. Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized
      in Japan to achieve at least 24 evaluable Japanese subjects.

    <measure>The proportion of subjects who have a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) at Week 12 and a minimum 2-grade improvement in PGA score from Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PGA is a clinical tool (a 5 point scale) for assessing the current state/severity of a subject's psoriasis. It is a global lesion score, and subjects will be scored using the following categories: 0=Clear; 1=Almost clear; 2=Mild; 3=Moderate; and 4=Severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects who achieve &gt;=75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from Baseline to each study visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI scoring system is a widely-used standard clinical tool for assessing the severity of psoriasis that takes into account the overall severity of erythema (redness), thickness (induration), and scale, as well as the extent of body surface area (BSA) affected with psoriasis. The 3 clinical signs are each graded on a 5-point scale (0=None; 1=Slight; 2=Mild; 3=Moderate; 4=Severe) and the % BSA affected is scored on a 7-point scale (0=0%; 6&gt;=90%) for each of the 4 specified body regions (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities).</description>

    <measure>Mean change in percent of total body surface area (% BSA) affected from Baseline to each study visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of BSA affected by psoriasis is a general indicator of disease severity and will be measured throughout the study. The extent of BSA to which study treatment is applied will also be recorded. The most frequently used method of determining the area of disease-affected skin as percentage of total BSA (% BSA) affected is based on the 'multiples of nine' theory. Another method is to estimate the extent of skin involvement using the size of the subject's palmar surface (palm and digits) as approximately equal to 1% BSA.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from Baseline in individual target lesion grading scores (erythema, scaling, and induration) at each study visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>A single target lesion will be selected at Baseline to assess efficacy in treating a discrete area rather than an overall average of all areas. For that lesion, the severity of erythema (redness), scaling, and plaque thickness (induration) will be assessed by the investigator on a 5-point scale (0=No evidence of scaling; 1=Minimal: occasional fine scale over less than 5% of the lesion; 2=Mild: fine scales predominate; 3=Moderate: coarse scales predominate; 4=Severe: very thick tenacious scale predominates).</description>

    <measure>Mean change from Baseline in itch/pruritus (numeric rating scale [NRS]) at each study visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Subject-reported itch severity, obtained from the Psoriasis Symptom Diary NRS. The Psoriasis Symptom Diary was developed to assess daily self-reports of psoriasis symptoms and the functional impact related to the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Questions about how severe and how bothersome various signs and symptoms are to the subject are answered daily using an 11-point NRS (0 to 10). In addition to the 16 questions included in the published instrument, 6 questions have been added to assess the severity and bother of skin flaking, dryness, and bleeding.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of local tolerability scores over time as measure of safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>At each specified study visit, the investigator or qualified evaluator will assess the presence and overall degree of irritation at the application sites using a 5-point scale (0=No irritation; 1=Mild; 2=Moderate; 3=Severe [report as an AE]; 4=Very Severe [report as an AE]). The score will ideally represent an 'average' across all application sites. At each specified study visit, the subject will use a 5-point tolerability scale (0=None; 1=Slight; 2=Mild; 3=Moderate; 4=Strong/Severe) to assess the presence and degree of burning/stinging and itching at the application sites.</description>

             has ended, whichever is longer) after the last dose of study medication and
             completion of the follow-up visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any sign of infection of any of the psoriatic lesions.

          -  A history or ongoing serious illness or medical, physical, or psychiatric
             condition(s) that, in the investigator's opinion, may interfere with the subject's
             completion of the study.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study treatment excipients, or a history of drug or
             other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates

             block.

        NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's
        formula (QTcF), with machine over-read. The QTc should be based on a single ECG obtained
        over a brief recording period. If QTc is outside of the threshold value, triplicate ECGs
        may be performed with the QTc values averaged.

          -  Ultraviolet (UV) light therapy or prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources
             of UV radiation (eg, sunlight or tanning booth) within 4 weeks prior to the baseline
             visit and/or intention to have such exposure during the study, which is thought by
             the investigator to potentially impact the subject's psoriasis.

          -  Used any of the following treatments within the indicated washout period before the
             baseline visit: 1) 12 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) - biologic agents

             interferon, methotrexate, other systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulating
             agents, or psoralen plus UVA light treatment; 4) 4 weeks - systemic corticosteroids
             or adrenocorticotropic hormone analogs; 5) 2 weeks - immunizations; drugs known to
             possibly worsen psoriasis, such as beta-blockers (eg, propranolol), lithium, iodides,
             angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and indomethacin, unless on a stable dose
             for &gt;12 weeks; 6) 2 weeks - topical treatments: corticosteroids, immunomodulators,
             anthralin (dithranol), Vitamin D derivatives, retinoids, or coal tar (used on the
             body).

          -  Participated in a clinical study and received an investigational product within the
             following time period prior to the baseline visit: 4 weeks, 5 half-lives, or twice
             the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is
             longer).

          -  History of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last 2 years.

          -  Participated in a previous study using GSK2894512 (or WBI-1001).
