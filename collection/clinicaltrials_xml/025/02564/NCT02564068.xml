      In human volunteers intranasal administration of oxytocin significantly increases
      parasympathetic and decreases sympathetic cardiac control. OSA is a very prevalent disease
      with high cardiovascular risk factors, yet this disease remains very poorly treated. This
      proposal, based on the current literature and new basic science results detailed above on
      the role of oxytocin in cardiovascular control, will test if oxytocin administration
      improves adverse cardiovascular events during the recurrent nocturnal apneas in patients
      with OSA. This project will lay the groundwork and provide preliminary data to obtain NIH
      funding to test this important hypotheses more thoroughly and in larger clinical trials.

      This study will explore if intranasal oxytocin has any positive cardiovascular benefits in
      patients with sleep apnea.

      This project will test the following hypothesis:

      To test this specific aim we will examine the changes in heart rate in a group of patients
      that have recently been diagnosed with OSA. The following approach will be taken for the two
      study cohorts listed below:

      Cohort A: 10 Subjects

        1. 10 subjects that have recently undergone a standard &quot;in the sleep-lab&quot; diagnostic
           polysomnography (per standard of care medical guidelines, and not for research
           purposes) and have been diagnosed with OSA will be recruited into the research study to
           assess the beneficial effects of oxytocin treatment.

        2. For research: These 10 subjects will undergo another &quot;in the sleep-lab&quot; diagnostic
           polysomnography that is identical to the one that they had for standard of care to
           diagnose OSA. This polysomnography that is performed for research will be funded
           externally by the investigating group.

      If subjects are female and of child bearing potential, then their birth control method for
      the duration of the study will be recorded, and a urine pregnancy test will be performed
      prior to the PSG.

      3. Within one hour prior to the research polysomnography the subjects will be given oxytocin
      (40 International Units, (IU) intranasally.

      4. The following 4 outcome measurements will be compared between the two sequential
      diagnostic polysomnographies (initial without, and second with oxytocin) in the same
      subjects: i. basal heart rate before sleep (primary outcome) ii. mean changes in heart rate
      with apneic and hypopneic events (primary outcome) iii. apnea-hypopnea index (secondary
      outcome) iv. percentage of time spent by the patient with oxygen saturations: &gt; 90%, &gt; 80%
      but &lt; 90%, and &lt; 80% (secondary outcome) The intranasal oxytocin dose is 40 IU. The drug
      will be stored in the Investigational Drug Pharmacy according to the vendor's
      recommendations.

      Polysomnography (PSG) is a comprehensive recording of the biophysiological changes that
      occur during sleep. It is usually performed at night, when most people sleep, though some
      labs can accommodate shift workers and people with circadian rhythm sleep disorders and do
      the test at other times of the day. The PSG monitors many body functions including brain
      (EEG), eye movements (EOG), muscle activity or skeletal muscle activation (EMG) and heart
      rhythm (ECG) during sleep. After the identification of the sleep disorder sleep apnea in the
      1970s, respiratory airflow and respiratory effort indicators were added, along with
      peripheral pulse oximetry.

      Cohort B: 10 Subjects Once enrollment in Cohort A is complete, then enrollment into Cohort B
      will begin.

        1. 10 Subjects that have recently undergone either a standard &quot;in the sleep-lab&quot;
           diagnostic polysomnography (per standard of care medical guidelines, and not for
           research purposes) or an &quot;at home&quot; PSG test and have been diagnosed with OSA will be
           recruited into the research study where we will assess the beneficial effects of
           oxytocin treatment.

        2. For research: These 10 subjects will undergo an &quot;in the sleep-lab&quot; diagnostic
           polysomnography that would be identical to the one they had for standard of care
           medical guidelines if they were diagnosed with OSA &quot;in the sleep-lab&quot;. This research
           polysomnography should be performed within 4 weeks of their OSA diagnosis PSG. This PSG
           that is being performed for research will be funded externally by the investigating
           group.

           If subjects are female and of child bearing potential, then their birth control method
           for the duration of the study will be recorded, and a urine pregnancy test will be
           performed prior to the PSG.

        3. Subjects will be randomized by the Investigational Drug Services Pharmacy of the MFA to
           be administered either Oxytocin (40 IU) or placebo within one hour prior to beginning
           the study polysomnography.

           a. Both the polysomnography technician, the patient, and all research staff will be
           blinded to this randomization. The only un-blinded personnel will be the IDS pharmacy
           staff.

        4. Subjects will then return within 4 weeks to have a second research study
           polysomnography performed by the sleep-lab. This polysomnography that is being
           performed for research will be funded externally by the investigating group.

        5. Subjects will be administered the intervention that they did not received during the
           first research PSG study within one hour prior to beginning the second polysomnography.
           Either Oxytocin (40 IU) or placebo.

             1. Both the polysomnography technician, the patient, and all research staff will be
                blinded to this randomization. The only un-blinded personnel will be the IDS
                pharmacy staff.

      For example: If at study polysomnography 1 a subject is randomized to receive placebo 1 hour
      prior to the start of the polysomnography, then at study polysomnography 2 the subject will
      be administered oxytocin (40 IU) 1 hour prior to the start of the polysomnography.

      6. The following 4 outcome measurements will be compared between the two sequential
      diagnostic PSGs (initial standard of care without oxytocin, and second for research with
      oxytocin) in the same subjects: i. basal heart rate before sleep (primary outcome) ii. mean
      changes in heart rate with apneic and hypopneic events (primary outcome) iii. apnea-hypopnea
      index (secondary outcome) iv. percentage of time spent by the patient with oxygen
      saturations: &gt; 90%, &gt; 80% but &lt; 90%, and &lt; 80% (secondary outcome)

      The intranasal oxytocin dose is 40 IU. The drug will be stored in the Investigational Drug
      Pharmacy according to the vendor's recommendations.
