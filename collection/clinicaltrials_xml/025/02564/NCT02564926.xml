    <textblock>
      This is a 52 weeks, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multi-centres phase IV study.

      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg qd or glimepiride 1~2
      mgqd in an open-label manner for 12 months as add-on to metformin 1000 mg.

      Parallel group study design was chosen. In order maintain the practicality of the phase IV
      study, open label design of study drug delivery was chosen. The reading of the DXA scans
      will be conducted by one expert in blinded manner. Glimepiride is the most frequently used
      SUs in Korea and therefore this was chosen as comparator.Dapagliflozin treatment will be
      associated with reduction of total body FM, BW, abdominal VAT and SAT volume compared with
      glimepiride.
