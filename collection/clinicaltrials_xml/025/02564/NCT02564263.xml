    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous cell
      carcinoma of the esophagus or Siewert type I adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction
      (EGJ) that has progressed after first-line standard therapy will be randomized to receive
      either single agent pembrolizumab or the Investigator's choice of standard therapy with
      paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan. The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with
      pembrolizumab will prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) as
      compared to treatment with standard therapy.
