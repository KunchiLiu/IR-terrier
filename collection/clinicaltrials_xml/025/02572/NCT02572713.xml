  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure alpha-synuclein in peripheral body tissues and
      fluids in Parkinson's disease (PD). This may help in developing better treatments for PD
      patients in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, cross-sectional, observational study to evaluate α-syn pathology in
      multiple tissues and biofluids in individual subjects with PD and HC at a single time point.

             or rigidity.

          -  DAT deficit at screening based on visual interpretation of DaTSCAN™ imaging.

          -  PD subjects will need to fall into one of the following stages:

               -  Early untreated PD not requiring dopamine replacement medication

                  without evidence of motor fluctuations or dyskinesias.

               -  Advanced PD with motor fluctuations or dyskinesias, &gt; 5 years from diagnosis.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice
             (GCP), International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and local regulations.

             urinary incontinence) suggestive of an atypical parkinsonism.

          -  Has atypical features of parkinsonism including but not limited to supranuclear gaze
             palsy, early recurrent falls, corticospinal track abnormalities, cerebellar
             abnormalities, significant cognitive dysfunction.

        Exclusion criteria (HC subjects):

          -  Has a family history of PD in any first-degree relative.

             disorders, encephalitis, repeated head trauma, polyneuropathy).

          -  Has a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of less than 26.
