  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical and clinical evaluations show that PRTX- 100 has biological activity that may
      lead to improved platelet levels where these are decreased due to immunological pathologies
      and that PRTX-100 has an acceptable safety profile. In vivo treatment with PRTX-100 has been
      shown to raise platelet counts in a mouse model of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The
      primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of PRTX-100 in terms of platelet
      response in patients with chronic/persistent ITP.
