  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of single and multiple rising doses of TAK-831 in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is being tested to treat
      people who have schizophrenia and cerebellar ataxia.

      This study will look at the PK, safety and tolerability of TAK-831 in healthy participants.
      The study will enroll approximately 96 participants. The study will include 3 parts: Part 1
      (single-rising dose [SRD]), Part 2 (SRD/multiple-rising dose [MRD]), and Part 3 (MRD).
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to receive either
      active drug TAK-831 or placebo which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor
      during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Part 1, Cohort 1: single dose of TAK-831 100 mg

        -  Part 1, Cohort 2: single dose of TAK-831 250 mg

        -  Part 1, Cohort 3: single dose of TAK-831 500 mg

        -  Part 1, Cohort 4: single dose of TAK-831 750 mg

        -  Doses for cohort 5 and 6 will be determined on the basis of tolerability of dose in the
           previous cohort.

      Dosing with TAK-831 will progress into study part 2 and 3, only after review of all
      available safety, tolerability, and PK data collected in Cohorts 1 to 2 of the Study Part 1
      This single center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately up to 58 days. Participants will be admitted in
      the clinic for the up to 20 days, and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose
      of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Experience at Least One Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to30 days after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who experience at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
