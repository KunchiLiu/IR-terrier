  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of multiple doses of inhaled QBW276 in patients with cystic fibrosis on top
      of standard of care. The study will be divided into 3 Cohorts. Cohorts 1 and 2 are designed
      to be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm, multiple dose study to
      assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of inhaled
      QBW276 over 1 week (cohort 1) or 2 weeks (cohort 2) in patients with cystic fibrosis
      regardless of their genotype.

      In contrast, cohort 3 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design,
      multiple dose study to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      inhaled QBW276 over 4 weeks in patients with cystic fibrosis who are homozygous for the
      F508del mutation. The primary rationale for cohort 3 will be to assess efficacy in a high
      unmet need cystic fibrosis patient population.
