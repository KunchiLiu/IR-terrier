  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this trial is to determine whether lymphadenectomy, used to restrict
      adjuvant therapy (other than vaginal brachytherapy) to node positive women, results in a
      non-inferior survival as compared to adjuvant therapy given to all women with high risk
      apparent stage 1 endometrial cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results from this trial have the potential to change practice whatever the results: either
      lymphadenectomy will become recommended practice if a non-inferior outcome is obtained;
      otherwise the procedure can be safely abandoned.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Disease-free, endometrial cancer-event free and endometrial cancer-specific survival

        -  Distribution of pelvic and extra-pelvic relapse

        -  Cost effectiveness

        -  Surgical adverse events

      There are also two sub-studies:

        1. Quality of life - all patients i. Describe the trajectory of key patient reported
           outcomes (PROs) from baseline up to 5 years post-surgery ii. Compare the specific PRO
           domains between the trial arms at several specific time points iii. Determine the
           proportion of women in each trial arm reporting long-term symptoms after treatment as
           measured by the symptom-specific subscales of the measures (gastrointestinal symptoms,
           urological symptoms, attitude to disease and treatment, vaginal symptoms, lymphoedema)
           iv. Determine the correlation between physician rating (CTCAE v4.03) and patient-report
           (corresponding PRO subscale) for various symptoms reported by both physicians and
           patients v. Assess the correlation between self-assessed lymphoedema (Self-report
           lower-extremity lymphoedema screening questionnaire) and the lymphoedema subscale of
           the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Endometrial Cancer Module (QLQ-EN24)

           We hypothesise that quality of life will be better in patients in the lymphadenectomy
           arm because a considerable proportion will be spared systemic adjuvant treatment, from
           which they may not benefit.

        2. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) - optional for Arm 1 patients

      The aim of this sub-study is to assess SLN status in comparison with the overall lymph node
      status after full lymph node dissection (LND), and so determine whether SLN is as accurate
      as systematic node dissection.

      i. We aim to determine the diagnostic performance of the SLN procedure compared to the gold
      standard of LND ii. To evaluate whether SLN status is a prognostic marker of survival iii.
      To model patient relapse and survival based on low volume micro-metastatic (LVM) and
      individual tumour cell (ITC) status

    <description>Patients will receive a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO)* with bilateral pelvic and para aortic lymph node dissection to determine whether lymph nodes are positive or negative:
Positive: patients will receive systemic adjuvant treatment to include chemotherapy Negative: patients will receive vaginal brachytherapy only
Patients will then be followed up, to include assessment of adverse events and quality of life.
*There is an option for patients to be randomised following a pre-trial simple hysterectomy and BSO. If randomised to this arm, the lymph node dissection will be performed as a separate procedure.</description>
