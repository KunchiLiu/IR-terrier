      To protect kidney function during the transplantation process by comparing mild hypothermia
      in the deceased organ donor before organs are recovered and pulsatile perfusion of the
      kidney while being transported to the recipient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of kidneys available for transplantation in the U.S. (~15,000/yr) does not meet
      demand (~80,000/yr). This discrepancy will likely worsen given the increasing U.S.
      prevalence of chronic kidney disease and is compounded by sizable organ attrition once
      organs have entered the donation process (25-30% attrition in Region 5). Furthermore,
      worsening renal function in donation after neurologic determination of death (DNDD) organ
      donors (an increasingly important source of allografts) is one of the strongest predictors
      of delayed graft function (DGF) and slow graft function (SGF) in the recipient. Both DGF and
      SGF are associated with decreased long-term organ survival and are of major concern to the
      transplant community.

      The investigators will accomplish this goal by extending an existing research infrastructure
      across several donor service areas. Infrastructure and logistics will be based on the
      investigators' successful completion of NCT01680744.
