      The purpose of the study is two-fold: (1) to further evaluate the safety and potential
      immunogenicity of GLASSIA following IV administration via in-line filtration; and, (2) to
      assess the effects of GLASSIA augmentation therapy on the levels of A1PI and various
      biomarkers in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) following intravenous (IV) administration at
      a dosage of 60 mg/kg Body weight (BW)/week active A1PI protein for 25 weeks in subjects with
      emphysema due to congenital A1PI deficiency.
