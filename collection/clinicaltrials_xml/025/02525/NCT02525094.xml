  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of MEDI9929 administered subcutaneously to adult subjects with moderate
      to severe Atopic Dermatitis. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion and will be
      stratified at screening. Approximately 100 subjects are planned to be randomized at
      approximately 35 sites in 6 countries
