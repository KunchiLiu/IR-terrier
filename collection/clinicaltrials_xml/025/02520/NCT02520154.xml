      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the effects of pembrolizumab on
      ovarian cancer. Researchers want to find out how the disease responds to therapy with
      pembrolizumab.

      Treatment:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study and agree, they will have
      their scheduled surgery, standard chemotherapy, and then chemotherapy in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

      Participant will receive standard chemotherapy treatment for three 21-day cycles:

        -  On Day 1 of each cycle, participant will receive carboplatin by vein over 1 hour.

        -  On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, participant will receive paclitaxel by vein over 3
           hours.

      Participant will then have their scheduled surgery. Some of the tissue removed during the
      surgery will be used for immune system testing and to compare to tissue collected before
      chemotherapy.

      After participant has recovered from surgery (about 3-6 weeks later), they will begin
      receiving chemotherapy again along with the drug pembrolizumab. Participant will receive the
      standard chemotherapy in the same way they received it during Cycles 1-3.

        -  On Day 1 of each cycle, participant will receive pembrolizumab by vein over 30 minutes
           during Cycles 4-26. Cycles 7-26 are called the Maintenance Phase.

        -  Participant will receive carboplatin and paclitaxel during Cycles 4-6 only.

      Study Visits

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam. If the study doctor thinks it is needed,
           participant will also have a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be collected for routine tests and to check
           participant's blood sugar level.

      On Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycles 1-6, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 4-26:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check participant's thyroid function and
           for routine tests.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Every 3 cycles, participant will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      Participant will the receive study drug(s) for up to 23 cycles. Participant will no longer
      be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.

      After participant is no longer taking any study drugs, the study staff will continue to call
      them every 3 months to check the status of their health.

      Post-Treatment Visits:

      After the last dose of study drug(s), the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will have a CT or MRI to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      About 30 days after the last dose of study drugs, participant will have a physical exam.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA-approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of certain types of melanoma. Its use in participants with ovarian cancer
      is investigational. Carboplatin and paclitaxel are both FDA-approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug combination is designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
