  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women who develop active TB are at increased risk of poor maternal and infant
      outcomes. Our data from South Africa show that up to 3% of HIV-infected pregnant women have
      active TB , many with advanced disease, contributing to the 40% of maternal mortality
      associated with TB or HIV in South Africa . Screening for TB in pregnant women in this
      setting is therefore essential to reduce maternal mortality. Symptom-directed screening for
      TB has been recommended by the World Health Organization and by the South African National
      Department of Health; however, no implementation framework is in place to operationalize the
      guidelines. Symptom-based testing is an efficient process that limits use of diagnostic
      tests, but may miss many cases. In Soweto, we found that 0.7% (700/100,000) of HIV-infected
      women had active TB when a symptom-based strategy was employed once, but in Klerksdorp we
      found that 3.3% (3,300/100,000) had active TB when universal testing, regardless of
      symptoms, was performed; most TB cases were newly diagnosed among women who reported no
      symptoms .
