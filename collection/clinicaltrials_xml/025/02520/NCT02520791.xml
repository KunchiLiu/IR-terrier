      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-inducible T-cell
      co-stimulator (ICOS) monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 in treating patients with peripheral
      T-cell lymphoma follicular variant or angioimmunblastic T-cell lymphoma that has returned
      after a period of improvement (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment
      (refractory). Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570, may
      block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      MEDI-570 (anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570) in patients with refractory/relapsed
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) follicular variant and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma
      (AITL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of MEDI-570. II. To evaluate the overall response
      rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) of MEDI-570 at all dose levels and in a
      10-patient expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      III. To determine short and long term effects of MEDI-570 at all dose levels on the immune
      system and on T-cell lymphocyte subsets.

      IV. To determine the relationship between ICOS expression on tumor cells and response to
      MEDI-570.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate biomarkers of response and resistance to MEDI-570 in the study population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 intravenously (IV) over 1-4 hours on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      weeks for 12 weeks.
