    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the use of specialized testing of solid tumors including
      sequencing. The process of performing these specialized tests is called tumor profiling. The
      tumor profiling may result in identifying changes in genes of the tumor that indicate that a
      particular therapy may have activity. This is called an individualized cancer therapy (iCat)
      recommendation. The results of the tumor profiling and, if applicable, the iCat
      recommendation will be returned.

      Patients with solid tumors that are at high risk for recurrence or that has already recurred
      or become refractory to standard treatment are eligible to participate in this study. All
      enrolled patients will have targeted sequencing of tumor performed. Sequencing results will
      be reviewed for clinically significant findings including determination of whether any
      mutations exist that suggest potential for activity of a targeted therapy (iCat
      recommendation). Results will be returned to the patient's oncologist and follow-up data
      will be collected.

      In this prospective multi-center cohort study, the primary objective is to describe the
      outcomes of pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors according to whether or not they
      received of targeted therapy matched to an iCat recommendation. The primary clinical outcome
      of interest is the endpoint of overall survival (OS), with progression-free survival and
      response rate (RR) as key secondary clinical outcome measures. To address this hypothesis,
      825 patients will enroll from an anticipated 11 participating institutions over 3 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age -- Age ≤ 30 years at time of initial qualifying solid tumor diagnosis

          -  Diagnosis

               -  Histologic diagnosis of solid malignancy (excluding brain tumors and lymphoma)
                  that meets at least one of the following criteria:

               -  Refractory, defined as tumor progression after initiation of standard first line
                  therapy without having achieved a prior partial or complete remission OR Biopsy
                  proven residual disease at the completion of planned standard initial front-line
                  therapy.

               -  Recurrent, defined as tumor progression after achieving a prior partial or
                  complete remission

               -  Newly diagnosed high risk disease, defined as having an expected event free
                  survival of &lt; 50% at 2 years.

          -  Specimen Samples

               -  Sufficient tumor specimen available to meet the minimum requirements for
                  profiling from diagnosis or progression / recurrence --- OR

               -  Surgery / biopsy planned as part of clinical care that is anticipated to yield
                  sufficient material to meet the minimum requirements for profiling; --- OR

               -  Patient has already had molecular profiling demonstrating a potentially
                  targetable variant in a laboratory certified to generate a clinical report, but
                  the patient has not yet started therapy matched to the variant AND sufficient
                  tumor specimen is available to meet the minimum requirement for profiling from
                  the same procedure and tissue from which the prior testing was performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No Therapy Planned

             -- Patients who have declined further anticancer therapy will be excluded.

          -  Performance Status

             -- Patients with Lansky (age &lt; 16 years) or Karnofsky (age ≥16 years) score &lt; 50 will
             be excluded.

          -  Life Expectancy -- Patients with anticipated life expectancy &lt; 3 months will be
             excluded.
