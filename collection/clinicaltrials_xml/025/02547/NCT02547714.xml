    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of secukinumab at Week 16
      based on psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 75 in subjects who had inadequate response
      to cyclosporine A.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Plaque psoriasis diagnosed for at least 6 months before baseline - Treated with
             cyclosporine A for at least 12 weeks prior to baseline

          -  Currently treated with cyclosporine A at baseline for psoriasis but is a primary or
             secondary inadequate response as defined at baseline by:

               -  PASI score of 10 or greater and

               -  IGA mod 2011 score of 2 or greater (based on a scale of 0 to 4)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Forms of psoriasis other than plaque (e.g., pustular, erythrodermic and guttate
             psoriasis). -Drug-induced psoriasis (i.e., new onset or current exacerbation from
             beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or lithium).

          -  Patients who have to discontinue cyclosporine A treatment due to side effects like
             renal impairment (serum creatinine exceeding 176.8 μmol/L [2.0 mg/dL]) and
             hypertension at screening.
