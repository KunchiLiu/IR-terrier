  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether participants with persistent developmental
      stuttering (PDS) who report fluctuational severity on a day to day basis of can achieve a
      more normalized fluency of speech by identifying dietary allergen responses and subsequently
      eliminating these dietary triggers from their daily consumption.

    <description>Initial speech sample prior to treatment protocol of study is obtained and qualitatively measured via the Stuttering Severity Index- 3. Participants are either classified as &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe&quot; in stuttering frequency. Participant self evaluation of perception of stuttering on their daily life will be obtained qualitatively via the Modified Erickson Scale of Communication Disorders, S-24.
Participant will be either classified as &quot;stutterer&quot; or &quot;not stutterer&quot; based on this score as well. Participant will then be administered a food allergy panel. Food sensitivity panel will be assessed for potential allergans. Allergan responses are graded from 0 being no response to food allergen to 3 being the strongest response and subsequent removal of sensitive allergan from diet. Speech sample and stuttering severity will be evaluated qualitatively again via the SSI-3 on repeat office visit at fixed interval scale. Erickson S-24 repeated at end of study and final conclusions made.</description>
