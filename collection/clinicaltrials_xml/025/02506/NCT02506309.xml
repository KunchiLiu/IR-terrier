    <textblock>
      Mid-urethral slings (MUS) now represent a gold standard in the treatment of female stress
      urinary incontinence (SUI). Second generation trans-obturator slings (TOT) have proven to be
      as effective as retropubic tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) with fewer major complications. A
      third generation of the MUS inserted through a single vaginal incision (SIS) has become a
      means to overcome significant post-operative groin pain. Novel types of SIS with a more
      robust and adjustable anchoring mechanism can assure adequate long-lasting attachment to the
      obturator membrane (OM). Objective of this study was to compare an inside-out TOT with an
      innovative fixation SIS in randomized controlled trial on patients undergoing their primary
      surgery for urodynamic SUI.

      Objective of this study was to compare an inside-out TOT (Gynecare TVT Obturator System,
      Ethicon) with an innovative fixation SIS (Ophira, Promedon) in randomized controlled trial
      on patients undergoing their primary surgery for urodynamic SUI.

      A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) is performed in one tertiary referral
      urogynecology center from January 2012 thru December 2013. Study included women with pure or
      predominant urodynamic SUI confirmed during cystometry by positive standardized cough stress
      test (CST) with urinary bladder filling of 250 ml in lithotomy position. Study was carried
      out on a Caucasian Czech (central European) population. A study power analysis was
      calculated with an expected objective cure rate of minimum 80 % for both patient groups,
      false non-match rate (alpha) of 0.05, and false match rate (beta) of 0.10. A minimum sample
      size of 42 patients was required for each group.
