      This randomized phase III trial studies how well high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B or
      ipilimumab works compared with pembrolizumab in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma
      that has been removed by surgery but is likely to come back or spread. High-dose recombinant
      interferon alfa-2B may help shrink or slow the growth of melanoma. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting
      certain cells. It is not yet known whether high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B or
      ipilimumab is more effective than pembrolizumab in treating patients with melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival (OS) of patients with resected stage III and IV melanoma
      treated with physician/patient choice of either high dose interferon alfa-2b (recombinant
      interferon alfa-2b) or ipilimumab versus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      II. Among patients who are PD-L1 positive, to compare OS of patients with resected stage III
      and IV melanoma treated with physician/patient choice of either high dose interferon alfa-2b
      or ipilimumab versus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      III. To compare relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients with resected stage III and IV
      melanoma treated with physician/patient choice of either high dose interferon alfa-2b or
      ipilimumab to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      IV. Among patients who are PD-L1 positive, to compare RFS of patients with resected stage
      III and IV melanoma treated with physician/patient choice of either high dose interferon
      alfa-2b or ipilimumab to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate OS and RFS for patients who are PD-L1 negative or PD-L1 indeterminate in this
      population.

      II. To compare OS and RFS of patients between the two regimens within PD-L1 positive and
      negative subgroups and to look at the interaction between PD-L1 (positive versus negative)
      and treatment arm.

      III. To assess the safety and tolerability of the regimens.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To bank tissue and whole blood in anticipation of future correlative studies in this
      patient population.

      II. To evaluate PD-L1 expression through immunohistochemistry assay. III. To evaluate the
      effect of treatment-related side effects that may have an impact on the health-related
      domains of quality of life (QOL) using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      (FACT)-Biological Response Modifiers (BRM), European Quality of Life Five Dimension Three
      Level Scale (EQ-5D-3L), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Diarrhea
      (FACIT-D) between patients treated with physician/patient choice of either high-dose
      interferon alfa-2b or ipilimumab and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      IV. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and anti-drug antibody (ADA) testing will be performed on all
      patients receiving MK-3475 (pembrolizumab). These analyses will evaluate: exposure-response
      analyses for activity and efficacy, potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and the safety of
      MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B intravenously
      (IV) over 20 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats weekly for 4 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Or patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 48 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Or patients receive
      ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for 3 years in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      3 weeks for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 6 and 12 weeks,
      every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months for 5
      years.

             patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or indicate that
             participation in the trial is not in the patient's best interests, in the opinion of
             the treating investigator

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, lobular carcinoma
             of the breast in situ, atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or melanoma in situ,
             adequately treated stage I or II cancer (including multiple primary melanomas) from
             which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which
             the patient has been disease free for three years

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 28 days prior to registration; women/men of reproductive potential must have
             agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the course of the study through
             120 days after the last dose of study medication; should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately; a woman is considered to be of
             &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12
             consecutive months; in addition to routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective
             contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent
             pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation; however, if at any point a
             previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time
             period for use of contraceptive measures, he/she is responsible for beginning
             contraceptive measures; patients must not be pregnant or nursing

          -  Patients who are able to complete questionnaires in English must participate in the
             quality of life assessments; (those patients who cannot complete the quality of life
             questionnaires in English can be registered to S1404 without contributing to the
             quality of life studies)

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign
             and give written informed consent for this protocol in accordance with institutional
             and federal guidelines

          -  As a part of the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network (OPEN) registration process the
             treating institution's identity is provided in order to ensure that the current
             (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study has been
             entered in the system

          -  STEP 2 REGISTRATION (RANDOMIZATION CRITERIA):

          -  Patients must not be registered until receiving confirmation from the Southwest
             Oncology Group (SWOG) Statistical Center that the patient's tissue specimen was
             adequate for PD-L1 testing; patients must be registered within 7 working days of
             receiving the e-mail notification

          -  Women of childbearing potential must plan to have a urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication; if the urine
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a negative serum pregnancy test
             will be required

          -  No tests or exams are required to be repeated for step 2 registration
             (randomization); however, patients who are known to have a change in eligibility
             status after step 1 registration are not eligible for step 2 registration; for
             example, ANC is not required to be repeated between step 1 and step 2 registration,
             but the most recent ANC performed before step 2 registration is required to be &gt;=
             1,500 mcL
