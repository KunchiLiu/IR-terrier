    <textblock>

      product (3M™ Cavilon™ Advanced High Endurance Skin Protectant) for the treatment of
      incontinence associated dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluated the product performance of a new skin protectant
      formulated to protect damaged and denuded skin even in the presence of exposure to the most
      potentially damaging body fluids, such as liquid stool and gastric fluid. The product is
      expected to intimately adhere to damaged and denuded skin and provide better protection from
      further damage than commonly used products such as moisture barrier pastes, thereby making
      it easier for nursing staff to cleanse the skin after incontinence episodes, thus saving
      time and also materials.

      The denuded sites on buttocks/thighs will be scored for skin loss and degree of redness.
      Over the course of time, with the skin protected, it should re-epithelizes. The skin
      improvement will be scored and the change in baseline over time monitored.

               4. Does the subject have a preexisting skin disease on the areas affected by
                  incontinence that may make skin assessments for this study difficult?
