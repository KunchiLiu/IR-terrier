  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 2 formulations of
      GSK Biologicals' varicella vaccines given as a 2-dose course in the second year of life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK Biologicals has removed human serum albumin (a stabilizer) from its varicella vaccine to
      minimize as much as possible the use of animal or human-derived products in the production
      of vaccines. The study is intended to provide information on the safety and immunogenicity
      of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' candidate varicella vaccine formulated without human
      serum albumin (HSA) in contrast to Varilrix™ (GSK) which contains HSA when both are used in
      a two-dose schedule, with the first and second doses given approximately 42 days apart in
      the second year of life.

      The immunogenicity sub-cohort will be comprised of approximately 400 subjects, representing
      approximately 100 subjects enrolled in each of the participating countries.

      Rationale for amendment 1: Sites in the UK can perform home visits. For subjects
      participating through home visits, the subject's parent(s) / Legally Acceptable
      Representative(s) [LAR(s)] will be requested to sign a Recruitment/Randomisation agreement
      to provide personal information and to agree to have their child randomised before providing
      written consent to participate in the study (to be provided at the 1st home visit).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects' parent(s)/ LAR(s) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will
             comply with the requirements of the protocol.

             day before 24 months) at the time of the first study vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject prior to
             performing any study specific procedure.

          -  Subjects in stable health as determined by investigator's clinical examination and
             assessment of subject's medical history.
