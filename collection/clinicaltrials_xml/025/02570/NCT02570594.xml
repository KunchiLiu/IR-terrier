      The aim of the study is to investigate the temporal organization of autobiographical memory
      in patients with schizophrenia. Patients and control participants will be invited separately
      to participate in a 1hour walk in the city of Strasbourg and at the same time, to carry an
      automatic camera around their neck, which is called SenseCam®. Pictures obtained with
      SenseCam® will be later presented to the participants during the session of test. They will
      be asked to determine the chronological order of 12 pictures corresponding to 12 particular
      events of the tour. Then they will be asked to watch the complete sequence of photos from
      the tour and to determine the beginning and ending of the events that have occurred during
      the tour. According to the investigators hypotheses, patients should have difficulty to find
      out the correct chronological order of the photos and to determine the appropriate
      beginnings and endings of the events
