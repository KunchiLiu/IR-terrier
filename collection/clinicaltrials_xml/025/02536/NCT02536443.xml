      The Contemporary Modalities In Treatment of Heart Failure Registry (COMMIT-HF) is an
      observational study on an all-comer systolic heart failure population hospitalized in a
      highly specialized cardiovascular center. The aim of the study is to assess the clinical
      characteristics, treatment modalities and prognosis in this population.

      The Contemporary Modalities In Treatment of Heart Failure Registry (COMMIT-HF) is a
      single-center observational study that is underway in the 3rd Chair and Department of
      Cardiology of Silesian Center for Heart Diseases in Zabrze, Poland. Data collection is
      patient-based (not event-based).

      The main objective of the COMMIT-HF Registry is to clarify the overall clinical
      characteristics of systolic heart failure patients, their demographics and clinical profile,
      current management, in-hospital outcomes and long-term follow-up, with regard to the
      administered treatment.

      The study population is formed by all-comer patients hospitalized in cardiology wards and
      intensive cardiac care units with a diagnosis of systolic heart failure. For the purpose of
      this study heart failure is defined as a set of symptoms resulting from myocardial systolic
      function impairment, confirmed in resting transthoracic echocardiography with left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%. Patients with acute coronary syndromes are
      excluded from the analysis.

      Complete patient demographics; medical history, complete hospitalization data (diagnostic
      and therapeutic) and in-hospital results are collected in an electronic form by the
      attending physician. The patients are under constant follow-up for all cause mortality and
      major adverse events.
