      The purpose of this study is to determine whether fluoride supplementation during pregnancy
      is effective in extending the length of gestation and improving overall perinatal
      well-being.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that preterm birth affects
      nearly 500,000 babies, or 1 in every 8 deliveries in the United States each year. These
      statistics emphasize the significance of implementing a safe and effective therapy into
      routine clinical care aimed at reducing the rate of preterm birth. There has been evidence
      to suggest that fluoride supplementation to women during pregnancy can provide several
      medical benefits in addition to a reduction in dental caries. Critical among these from a
      perinatal perspective is a decrease in preterm birth rate, increased birth weight and
      length, and improved growth and development of the infant.

      Fluoride is recognized by the Food and Nutrition Board of the American Academy of Sciences
      and the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) as a nutrient due to its association with the
      important in reduction of dental caries. The majority of fluoride in foods is bound and not
      bioavailable, and is most effectively supplied by supplement and by dissolving it in water.

      Upon entering the mother's body during pregnancy, fluoride is taken up in maternal bones and
      excreted by the kidneys. Therefore, there is no available fluoride for the fetus during
      pregnancy. When supplied during pregnancy in small aliquots, as with water fluoridation, the
      fluoride is so rapidly taken up in the mother's bones and excreted by her kidneys that the
      fetus is denied a meaningful amount of fluoride unless it is supplied in a pulse dose by
      supplement. Since 1997, the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board recommends 3
      mg/day for Adequate Intake in pregnancy and deems 10 mg/day as the Upper Limit.

      After several papers elucidating an association between poor dentition, periodontal disease,
      and preterm birth, subsequent RCT's of regular periodontal scaling and treatment during
      pregnancy are still inconclusive in regards to preterm birth.

      The investigators hypothesize that fluoride supplementation during pregnancy may have a
      beneficial effect on the natural microbiome of the maternal oral cavity and genital tract,
      capable of protecting against transient bacteremia and ascending infection, respectively,
      which are known antecedents to both preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of
      membranes. The investigators predict that the testing and analysis of these specimens will
      demonstrate microbiome changes toward a more favorable profile not associated with preterm
      birth.

      The proposed randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to confirm
      the efficacy of fluoride supplementation in pregnancy to extend length of gestation and
      increase overall perinatal well-being, and to confirm transplacental transfer of
      supplemental fluoride. This research may also identify other beneficial maternal and
      neonatal outcomes associated with the administration of fluoride during the perinatal period
      by attempting to characterize and compare the microbiomes of the maternal oral cavity and
      genital tracts between supplemented and unsupplemented gravidas.
