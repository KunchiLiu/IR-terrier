  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common feature of ASD is over or under sensitivity to the environment and difficulty
      putting sensory information together in an orderly way, referred to here as sensory issues.
      Building on previous work, this study will test the efficacy of Sensory Integration Therapy
      (SIT), a non-invasive intervention to improve functional skills in children with ASD, in
      comparison to commonly applied ABA behavioral treatments, in the treatment of ASD symptoms.
      A total of 180 children with ASD and sensory issues in the greater New York City
      Metropolitan area will complete this study.

    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most common neurodevelopmental disorder with
      estimated costs of treatment across the lifespan of $3.2 million. A common feature of ASD is
      over or under sensitivity to the environment and difficulty putting sensory information
      together in an orderly way, referred to here as sensory issues. Such sensory issues are now
      included in the diagnostic criteria in the DSM5 under the Restrictive and Repetitive
      Behaviors and Interests Criteria. These sensory issues have a deleterious effect on
      functional skills and limit participation in work, education, and social activities for
      individuals with ASD and their family. Building on previous work, this study seeks to extend
      understanding of Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT) as a non-invasive intervention to improve
      functional skills in children with ASD and sensory issues, and to test its efficacy in
      comparison to commonly used applied behavioral treatments. Further, the investigators will
      explore the proposed neurobiological mechanisms by which this intervention may work, and
      phenotypic moderators of outcome. This study utilizes a randomized trial to compare SIT to a
      commonly used behavioral intervention to evaluate outcomes on functional skills as a basis
      for improved independence over the lifetime. A total of 180 children with ASD and sensory
      issues in the greater New York City Metropolitan area will complete this study.

    <measure>The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>Increase between week 0 and week 12 in functional adaptivity as assessed by PEDI-CAT, with follow up for stability of change at week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PEDI-CAT provides a valid and reliable assessment of the child's ability to perform daily living skills. The psychometric properties including validity and reliability are well documented and the PEDI-CAT showed good discriminant validity between groups of children with and without disabilities in all domains. Score estimates were found to be stable over time with strong test-retest reliability</description>

    <time_frame>Increase between week 0 and week 12 in functional adaptivity as assessed by AMPS, with follow up for stability of change at week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An observation-based, standardized performance assessment of daily living skills . It has been standardized on more than 150,000 persons, ages 2-100 years of age, internationally and cross-culturally.</description>

    <measure>Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Reduction between week 0 and week 12 in repetitive behavior scale score as assessed by RBS-R, with follow up for stability of change at week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The RRB is a 43-item parent rating scale that measures the presence and severity of 6 types of repetitive behaviors: rituals/sameness (12 items), self-injurious behavior (8 items), stereotypic behavior (9 items), compulsive behavior (6 items), and restricted interests (3 items). The RBS-R yields an overall Total Score and six Subscale Scores, and has demonstrated reliability, stability, and validity in large autism samples.</description>

    <description>Children receives manualized SIT intervention that follows principles of sensory integration. SIT directly addresses the specific sensory factors hypothesized to underlie the child's functional skills difficulties and follows the Data Driven Decision Making Process, to tailor the intervention to the child's specific sensory issues. This process includes synthesis of assessment data, development of hypotheses about the sensory factors affecting the child's functional skills, and design and implementation of individually-tailored sensory-motor activities to address these factors. Data on the child's performance are collected throughout sessions to examine the child's response to intervention each session and allow for adjustments to procedures.</description>

    <description>This involves examination of environmental variables that influence behavior and altering those variables to improve the child's skills. Intervention is individualized based on identified needs of the child, assessment of environmental variables impacting their performance of specific functional skills, and their abilities. Once a specific skill is identified, intervention involves breaking the skill down into specific teachable steps, presenting multiple opportunities for the child to practice the skill, and then using strategies such as prompting, shaping, chaining, reinforcement, and error correction to increase child's' performance. Data on the child's performance are collected throughout sessions to examine the child's response to intervention each session and allow for adjustments to procedures to improve the child's performance. ABA intervention occurs in a distraction free room in which interventionists can simulate the environment relevant for each skill.</description>
