             guidelines.

          -  Current or former smokers with a history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette
             smoking.

          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/Forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio must be
             &lt;0.70 and FEV1 must be &lt;80% predicted normal value calculated using NHANES III
             reference equations (or reference norms applicable to other regions).

          -  Required COPD maintenance therapy:

          -  All Subjects must have been on two or more inhaled maintenance therapies for the
             management of their COPD for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening. Scheduled SABA
             and/or scheduled SAMA are considered inhaled maintenance therapies

        Please refer to the study protocol for the complete inclusion criteria list.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Significant diseases or conditions other than COPD, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may put the subject at risk because of participation in the study or

             in the study.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating, or are planning to become pregnant during the

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, have a current diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Subjects who have been hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 3 months
             prior to Visit 1 (Screening) or during the Screening Period.

        Please refer to the study protocol for the complete exclusion criteria list.
