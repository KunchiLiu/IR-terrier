    <description>Participants with CNS metastases secondary to HER2-positive MBC will receive pertuzumab in combination with high-dose trastuzumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Pertuzumab will be given as 840 mg during the first intravenous (IV) infusion, followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a standard dose of 420 mg. Trastuzumab will be given as 6 mg/kg once weekly via IV infusion without a loading dose.</description>
