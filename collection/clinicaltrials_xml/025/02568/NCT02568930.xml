    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes in
      older (60-80 years) advanced heart failure (HF) patients who undergo heart transplantation
      (HT) or mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a permanent implant (i.e., destination
      therapy [DT]) and their caregivers. Our study will contribute to better patient-centered
      care of older advanced HF patients and their caregivers, by informing decision making and
      guiding strategies to enhance post-operative HRQOL.

      The purpose of this study is to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes in
      older (60-80 years) advanced heart failure (HF) patients who undergo heart transplantation
      (HT) or mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a permanent implant (i.e., destination
      therapy [DT]) and their caregivers, risk factors for poor HRQOL, adverse event and symptom
      burden, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Advanced HF patients, 60-80 years of age,
      are an appropriate target group for this study because they are receiving HTs and MCS
      devices more frequently, and despite a greater risk for poor clinical outcomes, they have
      acceptable rates of survival. Using a prospective, longitudinal design, our multi-site
      comparative effectiveness research will compare HRQOL outcomes in patients who receive HT or
      DT MCS and their caregivers, from baseline to 2 years post-operatively. The primary aim of
      this proposed study is to determine whether older advanced HF patients who undergo DT MCS,
      as compared to patients who undergo HT, experience non-inferior change in overall HRQOL
      (primary), and domains of HRQOL (physical, mental, and social) from baseline through 2 years
      after surgery. Secondary Aims are (1.) to determine whether caregivers of older advanced HF
      patients who undergo DT MCS, compared to caregivers of older advanced HF patients who
      undergo HT, experience non-inferior change in overall HRQOL and domains from baseline
      through 2 years after surgery; (2.-3.) to identify risk factors related to poorer overall
      HRQOL in older DT MCS patients and their caregivers, as compared to older HT patients and
      their caregivers, at 2 years after surgery; (4.) to determine whether older advanced HF
      patients who undergo DT MCS, as compared to patients who undergo HT, have non-inferior rates
      of freedom from adverse events &amp; symptoms at 1 and 2 years after surgery; and (5) to
      evaluate the distribution of QALYs in older advanced HF patients who undergo DT MCS, as
      compared to patients who undergo HT at 2 years after surgery. Our proposed study will
      contribute to better patient-centered care of older advanced HF patients and their
      caregivers, by informing decision making and guiding strategies to enhance post-operative
      HRQOL.
