    <textblock>
      Alcohol leads to a leaky gut and translocation of bacterial products. This may lead to
      inflammation and immune dysfunction as well as the typical hangover symptoms. Probiotics are
      able to restore gut permeability and decrease bacterial translocation. A multispecies
      probiotic may be able to restore gut permeability and decrease bacterial translocation as
      well as inflammation, immune dysfunction and hangover symptoms after alcohol consumption.

      Specifically, gut permeability, bacterial translocation, inflammation, immune dysfunction
      and hangover symptoms in patients after alcohol ingestion +/- ingestion of a multispecies
      probiotic

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol binge drinking, defined as 5 or more drinks for men and 4 or more drinks for women
      at one time, is the most frequent form of alcohol consumption worldwide, especially in
      younger people. This drinking pattern is popular and leads to increased mortality and
      morbidity. Therefore binge drinking is a major public health issue. The behavioural and
      neurological consequences of binge drinking are well characterized.

      Less is known about the systemic effects on the gut as the first organ in contact with
      alcohol. Chronic alcohol intake can lead to increased gut permeability, bacterial
      translocation and alterations in the gut microbiome in animal models. Recently bacterial
      translocation has been shown in healthy volunteers after a single alcohol binge. On immune
      cells, acute alcohol intake seems to have dichotomous effects. On the one hand
      immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects have been described, however, alcohol
      induced liver injury is driven by pro-inflammatory reactions. These immune effects seem to
      be driven by endotoxin or other bacterial products via Toll-like receptors that are
      translocated to the circulation via a defective gut barrier. Immune effects of alcohol have
      also been linked to hangover symptoms after an alcohol binge.

      Furthermore there is evidence that endotoxemia might also contributes to alcohol dependence
      by promoting prolonged and increased voluntary alcohol intake in mice. On the other hand
      mutant mice lacking important genes for immune responses exhibit decreased alcohol
      consumption. This indicates that immune signaling promotes alcohol consumption. Therefore it
      is tempting to speculate that increased gut permeability leading to increased bacterial
      translocation after an acute alcohol binge could promote the desire for further alcohol
      consumption.

      Based on these findings methods to decrease bacterial translocation and restore gut barrier
      function would be of interest to prevent the harmful effects of binge drinking. The use of
      living microorganisms (probiotics) as a balancing agent in the intestine is said to restore
      the intestinal barrier function by increasing the epithelial resistance, inhibiting
      mast-cell activation, tight junction opening, pro-inflammatory cytokine release and inducing
      the secretion of (anti-inflammatory) interleukin (IL)10. Furthermore probiotics can increase
      the activation of alkaline phosphatase in the gut and thereby directly decrease the
      endotoxin-load.

      The investigators therefore hypothesize that the concomitant use of a probiotic during binge
      drinking is able to restore the gut barrier, decrease bacterial translocation and immune
      dysfunction and decreases hangover symptoms. Such a strategy might also decrease the desire
      to drink more alcohol.

      The investigators aim to test this hypothesis in a double-blind, placebo controlled,
      cross-over clinical trial where healthy volunteers undergo an episode of binge drinking with
      or without probiotic supplementation study.
