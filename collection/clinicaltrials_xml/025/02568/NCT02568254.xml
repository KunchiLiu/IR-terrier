    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, 8-visit, double-masked, cross-over study involving three marketed
      products as study lenses. Participants will be randomly assigned each lens type, which will
      be worn for approximately two weeks (12 +/- 2 days) each. Participants will undergo a
      minimum washout period of 3 days before entering the study and undergo a minimum 7 day
      washout period between dispensing each lens type.

          -  The subject must be between the age of 18 and 40 years (inclusive);

          -  The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in
             the range of -0.50 Diopters (D) to -6.00 D in each eye (inclusive);

          -  The subject's refractive cylinder must not exceed -1.25 Diopters of Cylinder (DC) in
             each eye after vertexing to the corneal plane;

          -  The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 0.2 Logarithm of the Minimum
             Angle of Resolution (logMAR) or better in each eye;

          -  The subject must be a current wearer of spherical, soft contact lenses (no toric,
             bifocal or multifocal contact lenses, no extended wear or monovision) for at least 5
             days/week and at least 8 hours/day during the month prior to enrollment;

          -  The subject must own a wearable pair of spectacles and wear them the day of the
             initial visit;

          -  The subject must be an existing wearer of spherical, soft contact lenses in both
             eyes;

          -  The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type);

          -  The subject must be willing to wear the study lenses for a minimum eight hours per
             day.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             wear (at the investigator's discretion);

          -  Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere
             with contact lens wear (at the investigator's discretion);

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will
             be discontinued);

          -  Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious
             immunosuppressive disease;

          -  Any active ocular infection;

          -  Is using any topical medications (excluding artificial tears (ATS)) up to two weeks
             prior to the screening visit;

          -  Any participants whose habitual contact lenses are used as an extended wear regimen;

          -  Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion by
             keratometry;

          -  Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
             photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK),
             etc.);

          -  Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal
             staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact
             lens wear; or clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar
             injection which might interfere with contact lens wear;

          -  Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to the study products;

          -  Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 7 days
             prior to study enrollment;

          -  Employee or family member of the Centre for Contact Lens Research (e.g.,
