    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain blood samples from up to 14 subjects who previously
      received namilumab in the previous study M1-1188-002-EM (PRIORA, [NCT01317797]) to correlate
      genetic markers with clinical outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Participants who received treatment with namilumab in the previous study M1-1188-002-EM
      (PRIORA [NCT01317797]) will have two whole blood samples (3 mL each) collected to correlate
      genetic markers with namilumab treatment responses as determined in the previous study.

      The study will enroll approximately 14 participants who received namilumab in the previous
      study.

      â€¢ No intervention is administered in this study.

      This trial will be conducted in Bulgaria, Spain and The Netherlands. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 1 day.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. The participant (or, when applicable, the participant's legally acceptable
        representative) voluntarily signs and dates a written, informed consent form and any
        required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Did not receive namilumab during the PRIORA study (A phase Ib double-blind, placebo

          2. Participants without any response time point recorded 4-week after the last dose of
             namilumab and beyond this time point

          3. Participants who were excluded from post-hoc analysis due to protocol violations
             during the previous PRIORA study.
