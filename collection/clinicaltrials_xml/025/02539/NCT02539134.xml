      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      multiple rising doses of TAK-935 in healthy participants.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935. This study will look at the
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of TAK-935 in healthy participants. The study will
      enroll approximately 56 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) to 1 of the 5 cohorts in Part 1, which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need): •
      Part 1, Cohort 1: TAK-935 100 mg once daily (QD) • Part 1, Cohort 2: TAK-935 300 mg QD• Part
      1, Cohort 3: TAK-935 300 mg twice daily (BID) • Part 1, Cohort 4: TAK-935 600 mg QD • Part
      1, Cohort 5: TAK-935 900 to 1350 mg QD.

      Participants will be asked to take the oral solution once or twice a day at the same time
      for 14 days. An optional Part 2 may be conducted for collecting data to assess the
      engagement by TAK-935 of the central molecular target cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CH24H) by
      measuring the changes of levels of the metabolite 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24HC). In Part 2,
      participants will be assigned to up to 2 treatment groups at doses based on the data from
      other ongoing TAK-935 trials, combined with the safety and tolerability data from Cohorts
      1-4 of Part 1.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study will be approximately 30 days. Participants will be admitted in
      the clinic for the first 14 days, and will be contacted by telephone on Day 28 for a
      follow-up assessment.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

             examinations, or clinical laboratory results which may impact the ability of the
             subject to participate or potentially confound the study results. It is the
             responsibility of the investigator to assess the clinical significance; however,
             consultation with the Takeda Medical Monitor may be warranted.

          4. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of TAK-935.

          6. Has taken any excluded medication, supplements, or food products during the time
             periods listed in the Excluded Medications and Dietary Products table.

             Additional Exclusion Criteria for Subjects undergoing CSF sampling (Part 2)

          7. Has CSF collection performed within 30 days prior to check-in (Day -3).

          8. Has a known hypersensitivity to the anesthetic or its derivatives used during CSF
             collection, or any medication used to prepare the area of lumbar puncture.

          9. Has significant vertebral deformities (scoliosis or kyphosis) which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may interfere with lumbar puncture procedure.

         10. Has a history of clinically significant back pain and/or injury.

         11. Has local infection at the puncture site.
