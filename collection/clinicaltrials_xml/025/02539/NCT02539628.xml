  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators believe sufficient spread to all nerves within the adductor canal—and
      thereby sufficient analgesia—can only be obtained by bolus injections and not by continuous
      infusions via a catheter. The aim of the study is to investigate whether an adductor canal
      block performed as repeated intermittent boluses provides superior pain relief to continuous
      infusion. The investigators hypothesize that adductor canal block performed as intermittent
      boluses via a catheter will reduce morphine consumption and pain as well as enhance
      ambulation and muscle strength compared with continuous infusion.
