  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1a/1b study of SC-003 in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian
      cancer. SC-003 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a monoclonal antibody linked
      to a potent chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1a is a dose escalation study in patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed
      ovarian cancer that are platinum-resistant or refractory. Phase 1b is an expansion study
      where patients will be enrolled and treated at recommended dose and schedule based on the
      Phase 1a.
