  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to establish whether adjuvant therapy with lenalidomide +
      dexamethasone after radiotherapy can improve progression free survival in patients with high
      risk solitary bone plasmacytoma compared with RT only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Solitary bone plasmacytoma (SBP) is a localised proliferation of malignant plasma cells
      (PCs) in the skeleton. The annual UK incidence is 0.4/100,000 (lower than multiple myeloma
      (MM)) with a peak age incidence at 68 years and there are estimated to be about 260 new
      cases per year in the United Kingdom (UK). The majority of patients with SBP ultimately
      progress to myeloma and this is likely due to occult disease not detected by conventional
      staging methods. Standard care for these patients is involved field radiotherapy (IFRT), but
      despite radical doses, two-thirds develop multiple myeloma at a median of 2 years, more so
      if there are high risk features.

      The IDRIS Trial is a phase III study where the investigators hope to demonstrate that
      adjuvant lenalidomide + dexamethasone following IFRT prevents the development of multiple
      myeloma in patients with high risk solitary bone plasmacytoma. Whilst a proportion of
      solitary bone plasmacytoma is cured with IFRT, it is clear that the majority will progress
      to multiple myeloma. The investigators are seeking to prevent this outcome by using adjuvant
      therapy in this study.
