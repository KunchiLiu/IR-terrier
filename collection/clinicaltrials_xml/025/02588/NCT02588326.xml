  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently FDA does not accept pharmacokinetic studies to show bioequivalence of
      locally-acting nasal suspension formulations.

      However, bioequivalence is defined as the absence of significant differences in
      pharmacokinetics of therapeutically equivalent drug products compared to the matching
      originally invented drug formulation. These there-called &quot;generic drugs&quot; are then
      interchangeable. Drug companies have to show that their generic version has the same active
      ingredient, the same label, is intended to be used for the same conditions or diseases and
      works at the same rate in the body.

      The aim of the study is to determine if pharmacokinetics is sensitive to differences in the
      particle size distribution of three different nasal suspension formulations of mometasone
      furoate during charcoal block. The result from this study will aid the FDA in finding
      methods to ensure that generic products are the same as the trade name drugs.

      As a subject in this research study the following procedures and scheduling will take place.

      During the screening visit the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to ensure
      the subject is appropriate for the study. A physical examination will be performed after the
      vital sign measurements are obtained. Also, nasal spray application training will be
      performed and tolerability to charcoal block will be determined.

      Screening tests will be performed within 30 days of study visit 1 and no later than 2 days
      before study visit 1. There will be 3 study visits additional to the screening, a minimum
      period of 7 days should lapse between the subsequent study visits but no more than 3 weeks.
      The total study duration for each subject will be about 5-10 weeks.

      Blood sample collection

      Blood samples will be taken 15 minutes prior to dosing and 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes,
      1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 hours post dosing. At each time point 8 ml of blood sample
      will be collected, a total of 389 ml blood will be drawn from each subject, including the
      screening visit.
