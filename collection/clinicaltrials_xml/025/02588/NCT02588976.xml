    <textblock>
      The SONOCLOT Analyzer (S1; Sienco, Inc. Boulder, CO USA, Model DP-2951) is used to perform
      kaolin-based activated clotting time as routine monitor of heparin therapy in patients
      undergoing cardiac operations. In addition, the device allows the assessment of the
      patient's coagulation status by a glass-bead activated test. Recently, a new SONOCLOT
      analyzer (S2) has been developed. As part of the routine management using S1, tests are also
      performed on S2. Results are entered into the cardiac surgery data base of all cardiac
      surgery patients and analyzed.

    <textblock>
      The SONOCLOT Analyzer (S1; Sienco, Inc. Boulder, CO USA, Model DP-2951) is used to routinely
      perform kaolin-based activated clotting time (kACT) as monitor of heparin therapy in
      patients undergoing cardiac operations on cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Apart from kACT, the device allows the assessment of the patient's coagulation status by a
      glass-bead activated test (gbACT+, depicting also clot rate = CR and platelet function =
      PF). Recently, a new SONOCLOT analyzer (S2) has been developed. Although the S2 shares the
      technical fundamentals with the S1, the redesign of the device may result in performance
      changes of kACT and gbACT.

      Routine management in cardiac surgery patients is guided using S1 and addition, tests are
      run on S2. Data are entered into the the cardiac surgery data base and S1 and S2 performance
      is compared by Bland-Altman analysis and % error calculation in order to establish new
      reference values.
