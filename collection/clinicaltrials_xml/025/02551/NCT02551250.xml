  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major complications in patients with chronic
      liver disease. The prognosis of HCC relies on the extent of disease at the time of
      diagnosis. Hence to detect cancer at an earlier stage, a regular surveillance test is
      important for the subjects with a high risk of developing cancer. Current guidelines
      recommend a regular surveillance using ultrasonography (US) at a 6 month-interval.
      Ultrasonography is a non-invasive and safe procedure, yet it is limited by the skills of the
      operator and it is often difficult to differentiate cancer from regenerating nodules
      especially in atrophied cirrhotic liver. According to a recent meta-analysis, the overall
      sensitivity and specificity of detecting liver cancer using ultrasonography were both over
      90%, however the sensitivity was decreased to 60% in detecting early lesions in which
      surgery or liver transplantation is indicated. Of note, addition of alpha feto protein(AFP)
      to ultrasonography also failed to increase the sensitivity in detecting small cancers. Taken
      together, there is a need to develop a new surveillance test with an improved sensitivity
      and specificity.

      Recently, a retrospective study reported that CT or MRI showed a better sensitivity than
      ultrasonography in detecting early liver cancer. However, performing CT as a surveillance
      test is limited by frequent exposure to radiation and contrast-dye agent. Although MRI does
      not have the risk of radiation-exposure, it is limited by the high cost and limited
      availability. On the contrast, non-contrast MRI offers a cost that is comparable to US and
      an absence of exposure to radiation or contrast-dye agent, which suggests non-contrast MRI
      as a good alternative surveillance tool for early detection of HCC. Therefore, in this
      prospective trial, the investigators will investigate the usefulness of biannual
      ultrasonography versus annual non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging for surveillance of
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
