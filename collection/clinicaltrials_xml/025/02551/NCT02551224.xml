    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with diagnosis of COPD (mild to very severe disease) based on
             post-bronchodilator FEV1 values in patients with FEV1/FVC &lt;0.70.

          -  No previous use of DPI.

          -  Over and either be current smokers or have a history of smoking &gt;10 years. (e.g., 10
             pack years = 1 pack/day × 10 years, ½ pack/day × 20 years, etc.):

               -  Note: A pack of cigarettes is equal to 20 cigarettes. Occasional smoking of
                  cigars is not relevant to smoking history.

               -  An ex-smoker is defined as a patient who has not smoked for ≥6 months at
                  screening.

          -  Willing and able to reproducibly perform spirometry and inhalational manoeuvers as
             required by the protocol.

          -  Willing and able to comprehend and follow the instructions for use of the
             inhalational devices to be tested in the study.

          -  Questions or requests for clarification regarding the eligibility of a particular
             patient based on the above inclusion criteria should be directed to the medical
             monitor before the patient is enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the components of the placebo used in the study or to
             compounds of similar chemical classes. This includes (but is not exhaustive) patients
             with known lactose allergy, allergy to magnesium stearate, and those who have
             suffered paradoxical bronchospasm on inhalation of placebo medications.

          -  Patients who received treatment with systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, or had a
             history suggestive of acute COPD exacerbation and/or hospitalization within 12 weeks
             prior to the screening or during the baseline period.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, defined as the state of a female after
             conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive urine
             pregnancy test.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, UNLESS:

               -  Women with reliable contraception methods.

               -  Post-menopausal women with no possibility of becoming pregnant.

               -  Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if
                  they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or have had
                  surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation
                  at least six weeks prior to baseline. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up
                  hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

          -  Patients with a history (at Visit 1) of asthma indicated by (but not limited to):

          -  Onset of respiratory symptoms suggestive of asthma (such as cough, wheezing,
             shortness of breath) prior to age 40.

             • History of a diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Patients with allergic rhinitis who use an H1 antagonist or intra-nasal
             corticosteroids intermittently (Treatment with a stable dose or regimen is
             permitted).

          -  History of clinically significant conditions including: significant cardiovascular
             disease, uncontrolled diabetes, a history of non-compliance, alcohol or drug abuse,
             any patient with active cancer, or any condition in the opinion of the investigator
             that makes the patient unsuitable for participation in this study.

          -  Use of investigational drugs (approved or unapproved) in the 3 months before
             screening.

          -  Within the 7 days prior to the visits, an increase in episodic use of rescue
             bronchodilator more than double the average number of puffs used in the preceding
             week or more than 8 puffs of SABA on any 3 consecutive days or more than 12 puffs of
             SABA on any 2 consecutive days.

          -  Respiratory tract infections (sinus, middle ear, oropharyngeal, upper or lower
             respiratory tract infection) within the 4weeks before the visit.
