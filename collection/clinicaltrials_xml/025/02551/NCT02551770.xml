  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this controlled study is to assess the clinical outcomes and patient reported
      outcomes of using minimally invasive surgical procedure with Straumann Emdogain as an
      adjunct (test treatment) or without Straumann Emdogain (control treatment).

      The aim of the study will be achieved through the following primary and secondary
      objectives. The primary objective is to evaluate the regenerative potential of Straumann
      Emdogain by comparing the change in clinical attachment level from baseline to 12 months
      between the test and control arms. The regenerative potential of Straumann Emdogain will
      also be assessed by comparing the changes in gingival margins, changes in average probing
      pocket depth, changes in full mouth plaque score, changes in bleeding on probing, and
      changes in root dentin hypersensitivity from baseline to 12 months between the test and
      control arms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical attachment levels (CAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>CAL will be measured in millimeters on the study teeth at 6 locations and the average calculated per quadrant. The average difference between 12 months and baseline will be determined and compared between the two arms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gingival margin (GM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>GM will be measured in millimeters on the study teeth at 6 locations and the average calculated per quadrant. The average difference between 12 months and baseline will be determined and compared between the two arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in full mouth plaque score (FMPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>FMPS will be calculated based on the number of tooth surfaces with plaque over the total number of tooth surfaces x 100. The value is presented as a percent. The difference in FMPS between 12 months and baseline will be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in bleeding on probing (BoP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>BoP will be measured on each study tooth in six locations. The presence of bleeding will be documented as a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; response and the percent of yes values will be determined per quadrant. The average change in percent of BoP will be determined and compared between the two arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in post-surgical pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 days post surgery, 1 week post surgery, and 2 weeks post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Post-surgical pain will be measured on a visual analog scale and reported in millimeters. The subjects will be instructed to mark their level of pain on a line for both the test quadrant and the control quadrant. The average change in pain level will be determined and compared between the two arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in root dentin hypersensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of root dentin hypersensitivity will be recorded as &quot;none&quot;, &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, or &quot;severe&quot; after a conventional air blast is applied to the study tooth. Changes in the frequency of categories will be determined and compared between the two treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pocket probing depth (PPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>PPD will be measured in millimeters on the study teeth at 6 locations and the average calculated per quadrant. The average difference between 12 months and baseline will be determined and compared between the two arms.</description>
