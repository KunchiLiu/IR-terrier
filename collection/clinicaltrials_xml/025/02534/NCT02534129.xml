  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial of the silibin containing cream, Difinsa53 to determine efficacy in delaying,
      ameliorating, or preventing radiation dermatitis in patients with breast cancer undergoing
      whole breast radiation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of DIFINISA53™, a safe silibin-based skin
      cream, on preventing radiation dermatitis (RD) when compared to an over the counter
      ointment, Aquaphor, in women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer following
      lumpectomy or mastectomy surgery. Presently there is no known fully effective topical
      protectant from RD and there is no consensus among radiation oncologists on how best to
      treat RD. This study seeks to identify a more effective option for patients receiving
      radiation therapy. Each participant will apply the DIFINISA53™ cream to one area of the
      treated skin and Aquaphor to another area of treated skin. Skin reactions will be evaluated
      using medical professional assessment, participant assessment, and photographic assessment
      by a third party.

    <measure>Radiation dermatitis as determined by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blinded observer and patient will separately quantify degree of dermatitis assigning each half of the radiation field a score from 0 to 4. The time to reach each grade for each area of evaluated skin will be evaluated for the pooled patients and reported as &quot;medium time to reach level [0,1,2,3,4]&quot; Timing for areas treated with Difinsa53 versus Aquaphor will be compared using paired T-test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Photographic evaluation of skin changes</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Photographic data will be analyzed by a blinded observer(s) to assess the dermal layer effect at a micro-3D level, trained by the Canfield team for use of the software provided with their camera. This will include quantifying maximum erythema for treated (Difinsa53) and control (Aquaphor) fields on a weekly basis by measuring optical reflectance at various wave lengths. Pooled data will be compared using a paired T-test.</description>
