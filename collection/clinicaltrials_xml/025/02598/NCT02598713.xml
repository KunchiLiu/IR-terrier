    <textblock>
      The goal of this interventional study is to test Quinine, Red and Blue food dye as markers
      of aspiration (endotracheal tube [ETT] cuff leakage) in mechanically ventilated, critically
      ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present there is no standard method for the evaluation of in vivo cuff leak and
      aspiration. Most of the tested techniques have major pitfalls that render their routine
      application infeasible. Lacking a practical and reliable marker, any possible intervention
      aimed at improving cuff seal and ETT performance in order to reduce VAP occurrence is going
      to be hindered by the inability to truly evaluate its efficacy. Radio-labeled markers are
      expensive, expose the patient to considerable radiological risk, and require transport to a
      radiological department, which would expose critically ill patients to additional risk. Dyes
      have the potential to give useful information about the presence of a cuff leak, but due to
      persistent staining of secretions, they do not allow continuous monitoring of aspiration.
      Amylase detection could be a good marker of aspiration, but its ability to detect aspiration
      is poor even when compared to pepsin. Pepsin and bile acids have the potential to detect
      some of the aspirations and cuff leaks that happen daily in mechanically ventilated
      patients, but due to their gastrointestinal nature, they do not offer any kind of
      information about aspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal secretions. With this research
      protocol, the investigators would like to validate the use of Quinine, FD&amp;C (food drug and
      cosmetics) Blue N. 1 and FD&amp;C Red N. 3 suspended in sterile water as markers for determining
      cuff leakage and aspiration events in an ICU population and compare its efficacy in
      identifying aspiration events with pepsin detection. Quinine, Bue and Red food dye are
      compounds commonly used in food manufacturing. Their pharmacokinetics and -dynamics has
      extensively been studied. The chemical structure of this molecules allows the detection up
      to pico-molar concentration by spectrophotometry.

      The investigators will challenge the oropharyngeal cavity with a known concentration of
      Quinine, Red and Blue food dye suspended in sterile water. The investigators hypothesized
      that the detection by spectrophotometry of the same substances in the tracheal secretions
      will prove aspiration.

      The investigators specific aims are:

        1. To quantify the measurements of Quinine, Red and Blue food dye in the tracheal sample
           and compare them to pepsin measurements in the same sample.

        2. To assess association between the amount of oropharyngeal aspiration and the
           development of upper and lower respiratory complications (i.e. ventilator associated
           pneumonia [VAP], tracheobronchitis, ventilator-associated events, acute respiratory
           distress syndrome [ARDS], etc.).

        3. To determine patient's risk factors associated with oropharyngeal aspiration. The
           introduction of this new, safe and inexpensive markers for evaluating ETT cuff
           performance and for detecting aspiration will improve the design of future studies
           aimed at VAP prevention.
