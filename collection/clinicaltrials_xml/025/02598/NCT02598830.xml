      This study evaluates the effect of vitamin D supplementation on outcomes of 12 weeks
      progressive strength training in 130 ageing subjects (&gt;45 years of age). Participants will
      be recruited into two similarly sized strata; one containing COPD patients and one
      containing healthy subjects. In each stratum, half the participants will receive vitamin D
      supplementation and half the subjects will receive placebo

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is a potent way of relieving some of the adverse morbidities associated
      with COPD, such as cachexia. It is thus problematic that 20-30% of patients fail to elicit
      positive adaptations to training. This oddity has been ascribed inherent muscular
      properties, with potential links to comorbidities such as vitamin D and testosterone
      deficiency or the nature of the training program. In the present project, we will take on a
      double-blinded RCT to disclose the functional and biological efficacy of vitamin D
      supplementation (with concomitant ingestion of 1000 mg Ca2+) on the outcome of 12 wks
      strength training in 130 aging individuals with or without COPD.

      65 COPD patients and 65 healthy subjects will be allocated into two strata and separately
      randomized into two equally sized supplementation groups; i) vitamin D3 and ii) placebo. All
      subjects will perform lower-limb strength-training protocols in a contralateral manner: leg
      1) high-resistance (5-12 RM) and leg 2) low-resistance (20-30 RM). Such a one-limb-at-a-time
      protocol ensures training that is unconfined by the cardiorespiratory limitations inherent
      to these patients, and allow comparison of the two training modalities in a manner
      unconfined by individual variation in exercise adaptability. A pilot study comparing
      one-footed and two-feeted training protocols will be performed. In addition, all subject
      will perform a selection of bilateral upper body exercises (5-12 RM), ensuring adequate
      hormonal responses and compliance to the study. The study is likely to revitalize guidelines
      for rehabilitation of COPD patients, and to provide vital information regarding the role of
      vitamin D in adaptations to strength training.

      For outcome measures specific to COPD patients, such as lung function and disease-related
      quality of life, final analyses will be performed on data from the COPD population only. For
      other outcome measures, such as muscle mass and strength, final analyses will be performed
      on data merged from COPD patients and healthy subjects. An important rationale behind
      implementing healthy control subjects into the project protocol was to increase the
      statistical power of outcome measures that are unrelated to COPD epidemiology and hence are
      of universal relevance to physiologcial adaptation to strength training. In a related set of
      analyses, we will perform between-groups comparisons, including multivariate analyses. We
      will also compare the efficacy of high- and low-resistance strength training, both of which
      will be performed by all participants, and are expected to result in similar muscular
      adaptations, including similar increases in muscle mass and strength.

      In general, we anticipate baseline vitamin D levels in blood (and hence changes in vitamin
      D, as obtained through supplementation), measured as 25(OH)D, to be a major determinant of
      the efficacy of the intervention. This means that individuals with low baseline levels of
      25(OH)D are expected to display more pronounced changes in functional and biological outcome
      measures than those with high baseline values. Such a scenario could be related to the
      inability of the project protocol to increase blood levels of 25(OH)D beyond a certain
      level; i.e. individuals with a certain blood level of 25(OH)D will not respond to vitamin D3
      supplementation by increasing 25(OH)D levels (essentially meaning that ingestion of vitamin
      D3 is leveled out by or exceeded by elimination of vitamin D derivatives). Alternatively, it
      may be related to the inability of tissues to respond to the resulting elevation in
      physiological vitamin D levels. To assess individual variation in vitamin D responses, data
      on functional and biological variables such as muscle mass and strength, will be divided
      into quartiles based on baseline 25(OH)D-levels, whereupon comparisons will be made between
      low-end and high-end quartiles. Individual variation will also be assessed using a mixed
      model approach.
