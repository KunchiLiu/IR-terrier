      An open-label observational trial with a convenience sample of one hundred formula-fed
      infants recruited from a network of general pediatricians in the Middle Eastern countries of
      UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar. Eligible infants will consume a high SN-2 formula for 12 weeks. All
      enrolled infants will be evaluated at enrollment and at 4 weeks and 2 weeks.
