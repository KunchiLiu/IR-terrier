      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple
      ascending doses (MAD) of Hypothiocyanite (OSCN-), bovine lactoferrin (bLF) and their
      combination (ALX-009) in healthy male volunteers and patients suffering from cystic
      fibrosis.

      Part I : SAD of OSCN- and bLF in healthy male volunteers (cohorts 1 to 3) - Part II : SAD
      and MAD of ALX-009 in healthy male volunteers (cohorts 4 and 5) - Part III : SAD and MAD of
