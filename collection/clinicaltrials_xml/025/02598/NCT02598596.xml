  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a high zone tolerizing regimen of
      pegloticase on clinical outcome, as defined by an serum uric acid level &lt;6 mg/dL, in
      patients with chronic, refractory gout.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      16-week high zone tolerance regimen of pegloticase on response to therapy (serum uric acid
      &lt;6 mg/dL) with this drug in adult hyperuricemic patients with gout refractory to
      conventional therapy.

      Eligible subjects weighing &lt; 120 kg will receive pegloticase 8 mg intravenously (IV) on a
      weekly basis (Week 1 through Week 3 - &quot;Tolerizing Period&quot;), followed by 8 mg IV every 2
      weeks through Week 17 for a total of 10 doses. Subjects weighing ≥ 120 kg will be
      sequentially assigned to 1 of 3 different loading doses (8, 12, and 16 mg) on Study Day 1,
      and then receive 8 mg on Week 2 and 3, followed by 8 mg every 2 weeks through Week 17 for a
      total of 10 doses.

      Subjects will be monitored for efficacy and safety endpoints through Week 17. Subjects will
      also have blood drawn for pegloticase levels prior to each dose on Weeks 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
      13,15, and 17. Following Study Week 17, subjects will have an option to continue dosing for
      an additional 8 weeks. A total of 53 subjects will be enrolled: 40 subjects weighing &lt; 120
      kg and 13 subjects weighing ≥ 120 kg.

      The study duration, per enrolled patient, will be approximately 26 weeks including a 2-week
      screening period, a 16-week treatment period (end of treatment [EOT] visit Week 17), and an
      optional 8-week dosing extension.
