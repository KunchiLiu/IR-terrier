  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if exercise fitness testing, is feasible and safe in
      persons over 50 years of age who have been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and who are scheduled to undergo a hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HCT). Assessments in this study include several physical tests to look at the
      capacity of your body before and after transplantation to see if these measures can help
      predict how patients do after transplant.

    <description>This longitudinal, observational study will evaluate the feasibility/safety of functional performance testing in older patients undergoing HCT for an AML or MDS diagnosis. Participants will undergo a symptom-limited CPET and 6MWT at three time points during the study: prior to myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens followed by allogeneic HCT, immediately following hospital discharge, and 6 months after discharge.</description>
