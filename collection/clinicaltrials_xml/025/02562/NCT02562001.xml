  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spinal cord injury is identified as the major cause of permanent disability worldwide,
      with the loss of ability to walk being the largest and most devastating of them for these
      patients. In this way, our goal is to analyze the effects of treatment with electrical
      transcranial direct-current stimulation of high definition (HD-tDCS) associated with gait
      training with partial body weight support aided by robotic device (Lokomat, Hocoma) in the
      march of patients with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). This randomized double-blind
      study will be built on the existing work already conducted at the Physical Medicine and
      Rehabilitation Institute of Medical School of the University of Sao Paulo, General Hospital.
      Outpatients (GA) and inpatients (GI) with spinal cord injury (AIS C and D) will receive
      active or placebo HD-tDCS followed by gait training with Lokomat (GA: 3 sessions / week X 6
      weeks = 18 sessions; GI: 5 sessions / week x 6 weeks = 30 sessions). The functional
      assessments (through clinical and functional scales, assess gait, muscle strength,
      spasticity, balance and pain) and neurophysiological (cortical excitability measured by
      transcranial magnetic stimulation) will be held before and immediately after the training
      period and after a 3 months follow up. The expected result is that patients that received
      the active HD-tDCS presents an improvement over the ground gait after the Lokomat training
      period significantly greater than the placebo group, with positive correlations between
      neurophysiologic, kinematics and functional measurements.
