  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a smoking cessation program for employees at the
      Yale University dining hall. Two pilot dining halls and six paired dining halls (3 test and
      3 control sites) will be offered a contingency management/pharmacotherapy smoking cessation
      intervention at the work site.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to test the effect of a smoking cessation intervention
      provided to Yale University dining hall employees on smoking quit rates and quit attempts at
      the end of six weeks of treatment. It is hypothesized that participants from the test site
      will have higher rates of smoking cessation and quit attempts compared to participants from
      the control site. In addition, this study will examine the number of participants who enroll
      in the smoking cessation program who successfully quit smoking at 6 months.

      There will be 3 test sites and 3 control sites in this study (broken down into 3 pairs of
      test/control). Each test site will be matched to on a control site. Self-reported smoking
      status will be obtained for all participants in the test and control sites at 3 time points
      (baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months). The study start time for each pair will be delayed by 4-8
      weeks for feasibility issues.

    <description>The TLFB is a standardized, validated, and reliable experimenter-administered rating scale that will be used to obtain quantity and frequency estimates of smoking for a 30-day period prior to study enrollment and at each CM appointment. It uses a calendar prompt and a number of other memory aids (e.g., holiday, payday, and other personally relevant dates) to facilitate accurate recall of smoking, and it has demonstrated adequate levels of reliability and validity when administered as an in-person interview.</description>
