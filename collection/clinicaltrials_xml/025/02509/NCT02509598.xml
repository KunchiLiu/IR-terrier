  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label, non-randomized, multi-center, within-subject comparative study to evaluate the
      tolerability and the diagnostic utility of Lymphoseek and compared with VBD in pediatric
      subjects with melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or other solid tumor. Subject age will range from
      neonatal through 17 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             conducted. Where locally applicable, the subject also understands and voluntarily
             provides his/her assent prior to any study-related assessments/procedures being
             conducted

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or other tumor where
             tumor resection or biopsy is planned and lymph node mapping is appropriate

          -  The subject is clinically node negative (cN0) at the time of screening

          -  Age &lt; 18 years

          -  Male subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use a condom during sexual
             intercourse and shall not father a child during the course of the study or will
             practice complete abstinence while on study

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to the use of two
             physician-approved contraceptive methods simultaneously or practice complete
             abstinence while on study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has had preoperative chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy

          -  Has had previous surgery or radiation to node basins that would be involved in the
             intraoperative lymph node mapping (ILM) procedure

          -  Has a known allergy to VBD or dextran

          -  Has a history of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependency in the 3 years before study
             entry, or is an alcoholic or drug addict, as determined by the investigator

          -  Before the administration of Lymphoseek, has received any radiopharmaceutical within
             7 radioactive half-lives of that radiopharmaceutical

          -  Is scheduled for additional surgery other than the primary surgical intervention
             within the 7 days after Lymphoseek administration

          -  Has rhabdomyosarcoma of the intrathorasic region
