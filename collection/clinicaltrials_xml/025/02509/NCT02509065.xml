    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to determine the effect on mean glucose, hypoglycemia,
      glucagon usage, and insulin usage of adjusting upward the glucose target of the bi-hormonal
      bionic pancreas, and determine whether there is a target at which adequate glycemic control
      is achieved by an insulin-only bionic pancreas with minimal hypoglycemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years and have had clinical type 1 diabetes for at least one year

          -  Diabetes managed using an insulin pump for ≥ 6 months

          -  Prescription medication regimen stable for &gt; 1 month (except for medications that
             will not affect the safety of the study and are not expected to affect any outcome of
             the study, in the judgment of the principal investigator)

          -  Live within a 60 minute drive-time radius of the central monitoring location

          -  Willing to remain within a 120 minute drive-time radius of the central monitoring
             location throughout the study

          -  Have someone over 18 years of age who lives with them, has access to where they
             sleep, is willing to be in the house when the subject is sleeping, and is willing to
             receive calls from the study staff and check the welfare of the study subject if
             telemetry shows a technical problem or severe biochemical hypoglycemia without
             subject response and the subject does not answer their telephone (up to two
             individuals can share this role, but they must be willing to carefully coordinate
             with each other and the subject so that one of them is clearly designated as having
             this responsibility at any given time)

          -  Willing to wear two infusion sets and one CGM sensor and change sets frequently (at
             least one new glucagon infusion set daily during bi-hormonal arms, and insulin
             infusion set every other day throughout the study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to provide informed consent (e.g. impaired cognition or judgment)

          -  Unable to safely comply with study procedures and reporting requirements (e.g.
             impairment of vision or dexterity that prevents safe operation of the bionic
             pancreas, impaired memory, unable to speak and read English)

          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the
             judgment of the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or
             the safety of the subject

          -  Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the
             immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception

          -  Need to go outside of the designated geographic boundaries during the study

          -  Current alcohol abuse (intake averaging &gt; 3 drinks daily in last 30 days), use of
             marijuana within 1 month of enrollment, or other substance abuse (use within the last
             6 months of controlled substances other than marijuana without a prescription)

          -  Unwilling or unable to refrain from drinking more than 2 drinks in an hour or more
             than 4 drinks in a day or use of marijuana during the trial

          -  Unwilling or unable or to avoid use of drugs that may dull the sensorium, reduce
             sensitivity to symptoms of hypoglycemia, or hinder decision making during the period
             of participation in the study (use of beta blockers will be allowed as long as the
             dose is stable and the subject does not meet the criteria for hypoglycemia
             unawareness while taking that stable dose, but use of benzodiazepines or narcotics,
             even if by prescription, may be excluded according to the judgment of the principal
             investigator)

          -  History of liver disease that is expected to interfere with the anti-hypoglycemia
             action of glucagon (e.g. liver failure or cirrhosis). Other liver disease (i.e.
             active hepatitis, steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver,
             hemochromatosis, glycogen storage disease) may exclude the subject if it causes
             significant compromise to liver function or may do so in an unpredictable fashion.

          -  Renal failure on dialysis

          -  Personal history of cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, pancreatic tumor, or any other
             pancreatic disease besides type 1 diabetes

          -  Any known history of coronary artery disease including, but not limited to, history
             of myocardial infarction, stress test showing ischemia, history of angina, or history
             of intervention such as coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary
             intervention, or enzymatic lysis of a presumed coronary occlusion)

          -  Abnormal EKG consistent with coronary artery disease or increased risk of malignant
             arrhythmia including, but not limited to, evidence of active ischemia, prior
             myocardial infarction, proximal LAD critical stenosis (Wellen's sign), prolonged QT
             interval (&gt; 440 ms). Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes are not grounds for
             exclusion in the absence of symptoms or history of heart disease. A reassuring
             evaluation by a cardiologist after an abnormal EKG finding may allow participation.

          -  Congestive heart failure (established history of CHF, lower extremity edema,
             paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea)

          -  History of TIA or stroke

          -  Seizure disorder, history of any non-hypoglycemic seizure within the last two years,
             or ongoing treatment with anticonvulsants

          -  History of hypoglycemic seizures (grand-mal) or coma in the last year

          -  History of pheochromocytoma: fractionated metanephrines will be tested in patients
             with history increasing the risk for a catecholamine secreting tumor:

        oEpisodic or treatment refractory (requiring 4 or more medications to achieve
        normotension) hypertension oParoxysms of tachycardia, pallor, or headache oPersonal or

          -  Hypertension with systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 despite treatment

          -  Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness (indicators would include symptoms
             such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and any psychiatric hospitalization in the
             last year), or treatment with anti-psychotic medications that are known to affect
             glucose regulation.

          -  Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might
             be susceptible to RF interference

          -  Unable to completely avoid acetaminophen for duration of study

          -  History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and
             vomiting

             hypoglycemia requiring treatment

          -  Use of oral (e.g. thiazolidinediones, biguanides, sulfonylureas, glitinides, DPP-4
             inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors) anti-diabetic medications

          -  Lives in or frequents areas with poor Verizon wireless network coverage (which would
