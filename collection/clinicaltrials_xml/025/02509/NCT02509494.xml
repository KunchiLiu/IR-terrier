    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of two
      candidate Ebola vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo, in a heterologous prime-boost regimen.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is staged Phase 3 study to gather information on the safety and immunogenicity of a
      heterologous prime-boost regimen. In this regimen, Ad26.ZEBOV will be administered as a
      prime vaccination and later boosted with the candidate vaccine MVA-BN-Filo. The study will
      take place in Sierra Leone and will consist of a screening phase, an active phase
      (vaccination) and a follow-up phase. The active phase of the study will be conducted
      initially in two stages. In the first stage approximately 40 adults aged 18 years or older
      will be vaccinated to gain information about the safety and immunogenicity of the
      prime-boost regimen. In stage 2 a larger group of approximately 688 individuals will be
      vaccinated to further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the prime-boost regimen
      across different age groups. In this stage, children aged 1 year or older, adolescents and
      adults will be included. Solicited local and systemic adverse events will be collected until
      7 days after the prime and boost vaccination. Unsolicited adverse events will be collected
      from signing of the informed consent form (ICF) onwards until 56 days after the boost
      vaccination in Stage 1 and until 28 days after the prime vaccination in Stage 2, and then
      again until 28 days after the boost vaccination. Serious adverse events will be collected
      from signing of the ICF onwards until 12 and 36 months after the prime vaccination in Stage
      2 and Stage 1, respectively. These data will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring
      committee (IDMC) to assess whether initiation of vaccination in the next stage or age group
      can be provided. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, which will be
      monitored throughout the study. Participants in Stage 2 will be followed up for safety and
      immunogenicity until 12 months after the prime vaccination. Participants in Stage 1 will be
      followed up for safety and immunogenicity until 36 months after the prime vaccination.
