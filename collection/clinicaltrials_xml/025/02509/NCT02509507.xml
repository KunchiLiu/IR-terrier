    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety of talimogene
      laherparepvec, injected intrahepatically, into liver tumors with known progression in
      subjects with Hepatocellular carcinoma and subjects with liver metastases from breast
      adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, gastroesophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma or
      squamous cell carcinoma), melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or clear cell renal cell
      carcinoma. The study consists of 2 parts and 2 groups. Part 1 is a 3+3 dose escalation
      consisting of 3 sequential dose cohorts each administering talimogene laherparepvec in
      increasing dose concentrations and dose volumes. In Part 1, the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      determination of non-hepatocellular carcinoma liver metastases (Group A) will be evaluated
      separately from hepatocellular carcinoma (Group B), and each dose cohort will need to be
      deemed safe for non-hepatocellular carcinoma subjects before it will be administered in
      hepatocellular carcinoma subjects. Part 2 consists of expansion cohorts administering the
      Maximum Tolerated Dose of talimogene laherparepvec determined from Part 1 for Groups A
      (non-hepatocellular carcinoma) and B (hepatocellular carcinoma) to approximately 10 subjects
      for each tumor type.

    <description>Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection only into liver tumors, with ultrasound or computerised tomography guidance. The initial dose of talimogene laherparepvec is 10^6 PFU/mL up to 4 mL in cohorts 1 and 2 and up to 8 mL in cohort 3 of Group A and Group B of Part 1. Subsequent doses of talimogene laherparepvec are up to 4 mL of 10^7 PFU/mL in cohort 1, up to 4 mL of 10^8 PFU/mL in cohort 2, and up to 8 mL of the maximum tolerated concentration from cohorts 1 and 2 (either 10^7 or 10^8 PFU/mL) in cohort 3 of Group A and Group B of Part 1. Subsequent doses of talimogene laherparepvec to be administered for the expansion cohorts of Group A and B of Part 2 will be the maximum tolerated dose (ie, maximum tolerated concentration multiplied by maximum tolerated volume) of talimogene laherparepvec determined in Group A and Group B of Part 1, respectively.</description>
