  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if tetrabenazine, which is commonly used to
      treat Huntington's Disease (HD), reduces the problems of impulsivity that are common in
      patients with HD. Investigators will also see how the medicine affects aspects of thinking
      and mood.

      This study is an open-label assessment of behavioral symptoms including depression,
      impulsivity, and suicidal ideations in patients prior to, and after, taking a stable dose of
      TBZ. Once a subject has provided written informed consent, he/she will be scheduled for a
      study visit. All subjects will be evaluated with tests of depression (Geriatric Depression
      Scale), impulsivity (Minnesota Impulsivity Scale, QUIP, BIS-11, and computerized impulsivity
      scales), and suicidal ideation (Columbia Suicide Scale) as a safety measure before they
      actually start taking TBZ. Patients will be asked to return to the clinic for an identical
      evaluation plus adverse events, after they have been on a stable dose of TBZ for 4 weeks,
      which would be 7 Â± 1 week after initiating TBZ. Patients will be titrated over 2- 4 weeks to
      best dose as determined by the investigator, up to a maximum of 75 mg/day.

      In our clinical practice, &gt;90% of HD patients take 75mg or less per day. This also allows
      for a more consistent and shorter titration period to improve patient retention. As patients
      are titrating, there will be several telephone contacts conducted. The initial dose will be
      12.5 mg BID. Best dose will be largely determined by adverse events. Determination of best
      dose will include one scheduled phone call and others as needed. Other medications will
      remain stable between visits.

    <measure>Change in Score on the Geriatric Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment detects depressive symptoms in subjects and is a commonly used neuropsychological scale. It is less influenced by motor / somatic symptoms compared to other depression scales.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scale is the most widely used self-report measure of impulsive personality traits. The BIS-11 is a 30-item self-report questionnaire that is scored to yield a total score, three second-order factors, and six first-order factors.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score on the Iowa Gambling Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>a widely used, but complex, neuropsychological task of executive function in which mixed outcomes (gains and losses) are experienced together, to performance on a relatively simpler descriptive task, the Cups task, which isolates adaptive decision making for achieving gains and avoiding losses. It is very predictive of impulsive personality traits</description>
