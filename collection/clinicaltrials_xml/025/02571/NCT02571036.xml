    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH) dose-escalation study designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and
      preliminary antitumor activity of DCC-2618, administered orally (PO), in adult patients with
      advanced malignancies. The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation phase and an
      expansion phase.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible to enroll in the study:

          1. Patients with solid tumor or hematologic malignancy must have a histologically
             confirmed, locally advanced malignancy refractory or intolerant to standard therapies
             and/or have no alternative effective therapy available, with the following
             exceptions:

               -  GIST patients must have progressed at least on imatinib.

               -  Systemic mastocytosis patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of aggressive
                  systemic mastocytosis (ASM) or mast cell leukemia (MCL) according to 2008 World
                  Health Organization (WHO) criteria for SM.

          2. Solid tumor or hematologic malignancy require an archival biopsy sample as long as no
             cancer therapy was administered since the sample was collected; otherwise, a fresh
             biopsy is required.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 to 1.

          4. The patient, or legally authorized representative, is capable of understanding and
             complying with the protocol and has signed the informed consent document.

          5. Adequate organ function and bone marrow reserve as indicated by the following
             laboratory assessments performed within 14 days prior to the first dose of study
             drug:

               -  Bone Marrow Function: ANC ≥1500/µL; hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL; platelet count
                  ≥75,000/µL.

               -  Hepatic Function: Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN);
                  aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT), ≤3 × ULN (≤5 × ULN in
                  the presence of hepatic metastases).

               -  Renal Function: Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min
                  based either on urine collection or Cockcroft Gault estimation.

               -  Coagulation Profile: Prothrombin time (PT) - international normalized ratio
                  (INR)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤1.5 × ULN. Patients on a stable,
                  maintenance regimen of anticoagulant therapy for at least 30 days prior to study
                  drug administration may have PT/INR measurements &gt;1.5 × ULN if, in the opinion
                  of the Investigator, the patient is suitable for the study. An adequate
                  rationale must be provided to the Sponsor prior to enrollment.

        SM patients with one or more inadequate organ function laboratory value may be eligible if
        both the Principal Investigator and Sponsor deem it to be disease related.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Patients with leukemias, with the exception of MCL.

          2. Treatment with anticancer therapy, including investigational therapy, within 2 weeks
             prior to the administration of study drug. For prior therapies with a half-life
             longer than 3 days, the interval must be at least 28 days prior to the first
             administration of study drug.

          3. Unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 (i.e., &gt;Grade 1 or baseline) from previous
             anticancer therapy, excluding alopecia.

          4. The patient has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate.

          5. New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease, active ischemia or any
             other uncontrolled cardiac condition.

          6. Arterial thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident (including
             ischemic attacks), pulmonary embolism, or hemoptysis within 6 months before start of
             study drug.

          7. Venous thrombotic events (e.g. deep vein thrombosis) within the 3 months before start
             of study drug.

          8. Baseline prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval based on repeated
             demonstration of QTcF &gt;450 ms in males or &gt;470 ms in females or history of long QTc
             syndrome.

          9. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% or below the lower limit of normal (whichever
             is higher).

         10. Concurrent treatment with proton-pump inhibitor.

         11. Major surgery within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.

         12. Any other clinically significant comorbidities, such as uncontrolled pulmonary
             disease, active infection, or any other condition, which in the judgment of the
             Investigator, could compromise compliance with the protocol, interfere with the
             interpretation of study results, or predispose the patient to safety risks.

         13. Malabsorption syndrome or other illness that could affect oral absorption.

         14. Known human immunodeficiency virus, active hepatitis B, or active hepatitis C
             infection.

         15. If female, the patient is pregnant or lactating.
