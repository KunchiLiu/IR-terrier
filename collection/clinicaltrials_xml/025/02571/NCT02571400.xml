  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of delayed opioid cessation after
      surgery, where delayed opioid cessation is defined as patients taking opioids ≥90 days
      post-surgery. The study is also looking to determine specific patient factors that
      independently predict patients at risk of delayed opioid cessation.

      The study hypothesis is that 5-10% of patients will remain on opioid medications ≥90 days
      after surgery, and that pre-operative prescription opioid use, pre-operative perceived
      susceptibility to addiction, and symptoms of anxiety and depression will be associated with
      delayed opioid cessation post-surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid analgesic use and its related harm are increasing in Australia. Opioid prescriptions
      have increased considerably over the last twenty years, and alongside this the investigators
      have seen an increase in prescription opioid misuse, and mortality associated with opioid
      use.

      Opioids are widely used in the treatment of acute post-operative pain. Current standards of
      post-surgical care advise patients to discontinue opioids once pain is minimal, leaving
      patients to self-taper their opioids with minimal instruction. This leads to a risk of
      delayed cessation of opioids in a post-surgical setting.

      Delayed opioid cessation after surgery has been minimally examined in the literature, and
      there is currently no optimal method to predict risk of delayed opioid cessation in patients
      undergoing surgery.

      There are 5 primary study procedures in the investigators research project:

        1. Enrolment in the study: Subjects will be recruited and enrolled at the pre-operative
           admission clinic and day surgery unit at St Vincent's Private Hospital, Sydney. This
           study aims to enrol 1000 patients.

        2. Informed consent: Patients who meet inclusion criteria, and agree to enrol in the study
           will be asked to read and sign an informed consent document.

        3. Initial questionnaire: Trained nursing staff will administer an initial questionnaire
           to all patients participating in the study. This questionnaire will gather data
           regarding potential predictors of delayed opiate cessation including age, sex,
           operation type, pre-operative opioid use, depression traits, anxiety traits, addictive
           traits, perceived susceptibility to addiction, average hours of sleep per night,
           history of chronic pain, and perceived general health.

        4. Follow-up questionnaire: At approximately 90 days post-surgery, a follow-up
           questionnaire will be administered to all enrolled subjects via phone call or email.
           This questionnaire will determine current pain scores and details regarding current
           pain medication usage.

        5. Statistical analysis: Once data collection is complete, identifying details will be
           removed, and data will be entered into a password-protected electronic database. The
           investigators will analyse data from all patients and determine the prevalence of
           delayed opioid cessation, and which questionnaire items independently predict delayed
           opioid cessation.

      The final goal of this study is to develop a brief screening tool that can be used in a
      pre-operative setting, to predict patients who are at risk of delayed opioid cessation after
      surgery. Identification of these individuals will allow clinicians to more carefully monitor
      their high-risk patients in order prevent adverse effects, morbidity and mortality
      associated with opioid misuse.

All subjects will be contacted by investigators at 90 days post-surgery. At this point, they will be asked questions regarding their current analgesic use. This will enable us to calculate the prevalence of continued opioid use at ≥90 days post-surgery. Data collection will be complete by June 2016.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be recruited to the study from October 2015 to March 2016, prior to their elective surgical procedure. Subjects will complete a single questionnaire prior to surgery which will collect data including their age, sex, operation type, pre-operative opioid use, depression traits, anxiety traits, addictive traits, perceived susceptibility to addiction, average hours of sleep per night, history of chronic pain, and perceived general health.
The investigators will compare subjects with and without delayed opioid cessation to see which questionnaire items were able to independently predict continued opioid use &gt;90 days post-surgery. Data collection will be complete by June 2016.</description>
