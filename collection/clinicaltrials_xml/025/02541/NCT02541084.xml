    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigation of the caregiver burden of Wet Age-related Macular
      Degeneration (wAMD) patients and at the assessment of how much of caregiver burden could be
      reduced in transitioning from Pro Re Nata to proactive therapy especially in real-life rural
      settings where public transportations are not readily available.

        Information on patients will be collected from all female and male out-patients with a
        diagnosis of wAMD who currently receive anti-VEGF therapy with proactive regimen at Kozawa
        Eye Hospital (Mito-city, Japan). Of these, patients who are accompanied by his/her
        caregiver and the caregiver (a pair of patient-caregiver) who satisfy eligibility listed
        below will be recruited for the assessment of primary and secondary objectives.
