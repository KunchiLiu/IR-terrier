  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine if a simplified protein counting system, including the free
      usage of fruits and vegetables low in phenylalanine, will improve the metabolic control in
      teens and adults with phenylketonuria (PKU).

      Anybody with a positive diagnosis of PKU, between the ages of 13-65 years will be invited to
      participate in this study.

      Subjects will be educated on the simplified system upon enrollment, and historical
      phenylalanine (Phe) levels will be used for comparison. Subjects will also be asked about
      their attitudes towards their current Phe counting system.

      This is a study to determine if a simplified protein counting system, including the free
      usage of fruits and vegetables low in phenylalanine, will improve the metabolic control in
      teens and adults with phenylketonuria (PKU).

      Anybody with a positive diagnosis of PKU, between the ages of 13-65 years will be invited to
      participate in this study.

      Subjects will be educated on the simplified system upon enrollment, and historical
      phenylalanine (Phe) levels will be used for comparison. Subjects will also be asked about
      their attitudes towards their current Phe counting system.

      Upon enrollment, a 3-day food record and Phe levels over the past 12 months will be
      collected. Demographic information will be asked, as well as questions regarding their
      current Phe counting system. Patients will be educated on the new counting system, stressing
      3 key principles: 1) free use of fruits and vegetables, low in protein, 2) protein counting
      as a simpler version of Phe counting, including reinforcement of label reading, and 3) daily
      use of PKU formula for enhanced nutrient and protein intake. Patients will be given written
      educational tools to reinforce this new method.

      At the end of the 12 months, subjects will be asked to provide a 3-day food record, and
      questions will be asked about their attitudes toward the use of the new simplified system.

      Phenylalanine levels from the 12-month study period will be used to compare with historical
      data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Positive diagnosis of PKU

          2. Males and females &gt;13 year of age

          3. Currently on phenylalanine-restricted diet

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any woman planning, or becoming pregnant during study duration

          2. Any patient who starts Kuvan during the study, as Kuvan lowers phenylalanine levels
             in some patients.

          3. Any patient currently enrolled in other research studies (Prism 301/302 Protocol;
             Institutional Review Board Protocol # 376-13-FB)
