    <textblock>
      In head and neck cancer, areas of tumours with low oxygen supply (called tumour hypoxia)
      harbour cells that are resistant to radiation and are prone to metastasize. Modern
      radiotherapy techniques are precise enough to deliver radiation to these small areas and
      could be used to target these areas to receive higher doses of radiation than the rest of
      the tumour to overcome resistance. Hypoxia can be &quot;seen&quot; in the body using special imaging
      such as [F-18]-FAZA-PET ([F-18]-Fluoroazomycin arabinoside positron emission tomography) but
      it has not been tested as a method for creating radiation treatment targets. As part of
      regular pathology tumour tissue is sliced extremely thinly (&lt;1/100th of a millimeter) and
      stained so that individual cells can be seen under a microscope. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
      is a special type of &quot;stain&quot; that can specifically highlight hypoxic areas. This method is
      considered the most accurate way to inspect for the presence of hypoxia. There is not a
      specific staining target for hypoxia ordinarily, but when patients ingest a substance called
      pimonidazole-HCl it builds up specifically in hypoxic areas and can be targeted for IHC
      staining. In this study participants with oral tongue cancer will have a [F-18]-FAZA-PET
      scan and take a single dose of oral pimonidazole-HCl before having surgery to remove their
      cancer. The whole tumour will be used to create microscope slides using very thin slices of
      the tumour. The slices will be stained using IHC to show where the pimonidazole has built
      up. Digital scans of the slides will be made using a laser scanner. The hypoxia seen on
      their FAZA-PET scan will be &quot;matched&quot; with hypoxia on the electronic slides to see if the
      FAZA truly shows where hypoxia is in tumours and if it could be used as a way to plan
      radiation treatments to deliver more radiation to just those areas.

    <textblock>
      Modern radiotherapy (RT) now possesses a high level of technical and physical precision that
      allows for dose escalation to levels previously considered unsafe (e.g. lung stereotactic
      RT). Due to safety concerns, there is considerable interest in the concept of 'dose
      painting', where a non-uniform dose is delivered to a biologic target volume where
      radioresistance is expected. The hypoxic target volume is likely a major source of cancer
      recurrence and can be defined on functional imaging (FAZA-PET). However, the accuracy of
      FAZA-PET in defining a hypoxic volume for radiation targeting is not known. Finding a good
      correlation between pathology (as a reference standard) to a hypoxic PET target would
      provide the foundation for a feasible dose escalation clinical trial in high risk head and
      neck cancer that can finally take advantage of all the technical improvements in radiation
      delivery.

      This study aims to assess the degree to which hypoxia measured by [F-18]-FAZA-PET imaging is
      correlated with a reference standard of hypoxia confirmed by pimonidazole targeted
      immunohistochemistry using a 3D whole-mount histopathologic approach.

      This is a pilot study in the form of a prospective, Phase II, single arm, trial to
      investigate the use of IHC methods to validate functional medical imaging on the sub-tumour
      level.

      Ten patients with biopsy confirmed oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma where surgery is the
      intended form of definitive treatment will be approached to participate in the study.
      Participants will have received pre-study testing that is standard of care (e.g. biopsy,
      complete blood count, serum electrolytes, urinalysis, liver function tests, beta-hCG
      testing, etc.) with no incremental testing. Patients will receive a routine MRI and CT. In
      addition they will receive a [F-18]-FAZA-PET scan 2-3 days prior to surgery. Within 1 week
      of surgery patients will be seen in the pre-anaesthesia clinic for repeat bloodwork and
      routine peri-operative assessments. On the day before surgery, in addition to typical
      peri-operative activities (e.g. 24 hour solid fast, only consuming clear fluids) the patient
      will be instructed to take the prescribed dose of oral pimonidazole-HCl 16-20 hours before
      surgery. The patient will be admitted for same day surgery which will be carried out in a
      routine fashion, e.g. total removal of tumour plus appropriate margins. For research
      purposes, the specimen will be processed differently than routine pathology. Once the
      specimen has been completely removed have several external markers applied to its surface to
      guide orientation. The specimen will then be embedded in 3.5% agar and placed on ice for 1
      hour. The embedded specimen will undergo an MRI (ex-vivo) noting the position of the
      specimen in the block using the external markers. The MRI will be a single 5 minute T1
      sequence. The specimen is cut from front to back in 3 mm slices and stained for pimonidazole
      to show hypoxia as well as typical hematoxylin and eosin staining that will be used for
      clinical pathologic assessment. Histology slides will be digitized with a laser scanner at a
      resolution of 0.5Âµm/pixel. The gross tumour and areas of macroscopic hypoxia will be defined
      by a pathologist. The histology images will be reconstructed using the external markers and
      internal landmarks as well as the ex-vivo MRI and matched (co-registered) to the in vivo
      FAZA-PET/CT/MRI tumour volumes.

      Despite the available high technical precision of radiation treatment machines, limited
      clinical progress has been made in the last 15 years in sub-volume (i.e. less than whole
      tumour) targeting because of target uncertainty. With a multidisciplinary,
      multi-institutional collaboration, our group will correlate FAZA-PET imaging to a 3D
      histological reference to validate (i.e. evaluate accuracy) functional imaging at a
      unprecedented level. This invaluable understanding of the biological underpinnings of
      commonly used functional imaging could help form the basis of future clinical trials.
