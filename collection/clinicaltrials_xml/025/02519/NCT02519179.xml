      The objective this research is to conduct a within-subject, experimental study that will
      describe mothers' feeding practices during typical bottle-feeding conditions and will
      examine whether removal of visual cues related to the amount of milk/formula in the bottle
      will alter these feeding practices. The investigators hypothesize that mothers will show
      higher levels of infant-directed feeding practices and lower levels of mother-directed
      feeding practices when using opaque, weighted bottles compared to when using standard, clear
      bottles. The investigators also hypothesize that infants will consume less breast milk or
      formula when fed from opaque, weighted bottles compared to when fed from standard, clear
      bottles.
