  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fosaprepitant (MK-0517)
      plus ondansetron versus ondansetron alone for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea
      and vomiting (CINV) in pediatric participants scheduled to receive chemotherapeutic agent(s)
      associated with moderate or high risk of causing emesis (vomiting), or chemotherapy agent(s)
      not previously tolerated due to vomiting. The primary hypothesis is that a single dose of
      fosaprepitant in combination with ondansetron provides superior control of CINV compared to
      ondansetron alone as measured by the percentage of participants with a Complete Response (no
      vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medications) in the delayed phase (&gt;24 to 120
      hours) following initiation of emetogneic chemotherapy in Cycle 1.

      In Cycle 1, participants will receive double-blind study drug (fosaprepitant plus
      ondansetron with or without dexamethasone OR placebo to fosaprepitant plus ondansetron with
      or without dexamethasone). Upon completion of Cycle 1, participants may have the option to
      continue for up to 5 additional open-label cycles, receiving fosaprepitant plus ondansetron
      with or without dexamethasone.
