    <textblock>
      People infected with HIV often have cognitive dysfunction even if they are on antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) and have undetectable viral loads. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if
      the addition of maraviroc (MVC) and dolutegravir (DTG) (which are two antiretroviral [ARV]
      medications) to participants' existing ART regimens will improve participants'
      neurocognitive performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected people often have cognitive dysfunction (HIV-associated neurocognitive
      disorder, or HAND), which includes asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild
      neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD), even if they are on ART
      and have undetectable viral loads. In this study, researchers will evaluate the
      effectiveness of adding MVC and DTG to the current ART regimen of HIV-infected people with
      undetectable (&lt;50 copies/mL) plasma HIV-1 RNA who have mild to moderate neurocognitive
      impairment and who have been on stable ART for at least 6 months prior to study entry. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of MVC and DTG to participants'
      existing ART regimens will improve participants' neurocognitive performance.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms. All participants will remain on
      their existing ART regimens; they will take their assigned study drugs in addition to their
      ART regimen. Participants in Arm A will receive placebo for MVC and placebo for DTG.
      Participants in Arm B will receive DTG and placebo for MVC. Participants in Arm C will
      receive MVC and DTG. Study visits will occur at entry and Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, and
      96. Visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, neurocognitive testing, and
      questionnaires. Some participants may have an optional lumbar puncture procedure.
      Participants will have to return for refills of study drugs on Weeks 36, 60, and 84. No
      evaluations will be performed during these visits.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral
             load. NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a United States Food and Drug
             Administration (FDA)-approved kit, which is required for all IND studies. WHO (World
             Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines
             mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is
             different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test
             should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based
             on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (eg, indirect
             versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA.

          -  On current ART for at least 6 months prior to study entry with no interruption in
             treatment of greater than or equal to 7 days. Note: The following ART changes are
             allowed:

               -  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to tenofovir alafenamide fumarate
                  (TAF)/TAF-containing fixed-dose combination regimens

               -  Ritonavir (RTV) to cobicistat (COBI)/COBI-containing fixed-dose combination
                  regimens

          -  No plans to change ART while on study. Note: The following ART changes are allowed:

               -  TDF to TAF/TAF-containing fixed-dose combination regimens

               -  RTV to COBI/COBI-containing fixed-dose combination regimens

          -  HIV-1 plasma RNA less than 50 copies/mL obtained within 90 days prior to study entry
             by any FDA-approved assay at any United States laboratory that has a Clinical
             Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification or its equivalent

          -  No more than one HIV-1 plasma RNA greater than or equal to 50 and less than 200
             copies/mL (only one &quot;blip&quot;) in the past 6 months with a subsequent HIV-1 plasma RNA
             less than 50 copies/mL. NOTE: There should be no observation of HIV-1 plasma RNA
             greater than 200 copies/mL within the 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  HAND diagnosis (ANI, MND, or HAD) within 45 days prior to study entry. HAND diagnosis
             is neurocognitive impairment defined as at least mild impairment (more than one
             standard deviation below appropriate normative data in two domains of functioning)
             and no severely confounding factors.

          -  Screening laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to study entry:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 500/mm^3

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 7.5 g/dL

               -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 40,000/mm^3

               -  Creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

                  taking an indinavir (IDV)- or atazanavir (ATV)-containing regimen at the time of
                  screening, total bilirubin less than or equal to 5 x ULN is acceptable.

               -  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than or equal to 60 mL/min, either measured
                  or estimated by Cockcroft-Gault equation. NOTE: A calculator for estimating the
                  CrCl can be found at www.fstrf.org/ACTG/ccc.html

          -  Females of reproductive potential (women who have not been post-menopausal for at
             least 24 consecutive months, ie, who have had menses within the preceding 24 months,
             or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization, hysterectomy or bilateral
             salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum
             or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of less than or equal to 25 mIU/mL within
             48 hours prior to study entry

          -  Females of reproductive potential must agree not to participate in the conception
             process (ie, active attempt to become pregnant, in vitro fertilization), and if
             participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must use at least one
             reliable form of contraceptive. Female participants must use contraceptives while
             receiving study treatment and for 6 weeks after stopping study treatment. More
             information on this criterion is available in the protocol.

               -  Participants who do not agree to participate in the optional LP may still
                  participate in the study.

               -  Participants currently taking anti-platelet agents, except aspirin or
                  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are excluded from participation
                  in the optional LP. However they may still participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:
