  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the potential of linaclotide treatment to
      induce the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). The secondary objectives are to
      provide additional evidence supporting the long-term safety and efficacy of linaclotide in
      adult irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation
      (CIC) patients and to evaluate lower doses of linaclotide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes up to a 3-week Screening Period, followed by a 52-week treatment period.
      Patients with CIC meeting the entry criteria will receive linaclotide 145-ug capsules,
      orally, once daily and patients with IBS-C meeting the entry criteria will receive
      linaclotide 290-ug capsules, orally, once daily.

             clinical trial or could confound the study assessments.

          -  Patient has ever received linaclotide as a treatment (including
             commercially-available product) or has been randomized into any clinical study in
             which linaclotide was a treatment. (Patients who enrolled into linaclotide clinical
             studies conducted prior or during this study but failed to be randomized are eligible
             for the current study).

          -  Patient has ever received plecanatide, SP-333, or has participated in a plecanatide
