    <textblock>
      The investigators expect to enroll 15 participants with relapsed or refractory
      IgM-associated AL amyloidosis onto this Phase II clinical trial. Idelalisib will be
      self-administered orally at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (may be increased to 150 mg (one
      tablet) twice daily after 3 months at investigator discretion). Participants will be treated
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or decision to withdraw from the trial.
      Disease evaluations will be performed every three months until disease progression.

    <textblock>
      This study includes the use of Idelalisib to treat previously treated patients with
      IgM-associated AL Amyloidosis at Boston Medical Center. Boston Medical Center is
      internationally recognized as a leader in amyloidosis research and patient care through the
      activities of the multidisciplinary Amyloid Center at Boston University. The problematic
      cell in most forms of AL amyloidosis shares similarities with multiple myeloma. However, in
      the small subset of AL Amyloidosis patients with an IgM paraprotein, the cells are more
      typically related to lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Because
      clonal CD20+ lymphoplasmacytic cells are usually responsible for IgM paraproteins, treatment
      paradigms based on Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) may be more appropriate than
      myeloma-based strategies. Idelalisib has been shown to be active and well tolerated in
      patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma including chronic lymphocytic
      lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with or without Waldenström's macroglobulinemia
      (WM). The side effect profile of idelalisib merges well with the known predisposition to
      toxicity of amyloidosis patient.

      The investigators expect to enroll 15 participants with IgM-associated AL amyloidosis onto
      this Phase II clinical trial. Idelalisib will be self-administered orally at a dose of 100
      mg (1 tablet) twice daily (may be escalated to 150 mg (one tablet) twice daily after 3
      months at investigator discretion). Participants will be treated until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or decision to withdraw from the trial. Disease evaluations will be
      performed every three months until disease progression.
