  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients requiring pars plana vitrectomy receiving
      preoperative 0.625 mg intravitreal bevacizumab 3-10 days prior to vitrectomy will have
      similar surgery times and similar intra-operative and postoperative complications to
      subjects who receive preoperative 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab at both 3-5 days, and
      6-10 days prior to vitrectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe vision loss in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) frequently
      results from complications related to neovascularization and fibrovascular proliferation.
      Patients with PDR are typically considered candidates for pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) when
      non-clearing vitreous hemorrhaging, tractional retinal detachment (TRD) development or
      extensive fibrovascular proliferation occur. Visual prognosis is guarded in patients
      undergoing PPV with these advanced presentations of PDR because of the high rate of both
      intra-operative and postoperative complications. Intra-operative bleeding may result in poor
      visualization during PPV that increases total surgery time and ultimately leads to surgical
      failure, while recurrent/persistent postoperative vitreous hemorrhage may occur as high as
      75% and hinder visual rehabilitation and monitoring of further disease progression.

      Preoperative administration of bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco,
      California, USA), a full-length recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody targeting vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been reported in prospective clinical trials to
      decrease the overall surgery time, lower the rate of intra-operative complications, and
      reduce the occurrence of postoperative hemorrhaging in PDR patients with active
      neovascularization and/or extensive fibrovascular proliferation undergoing PPV. Furthermore,
      two meta-analysis studies examining published randomized controlled trials support the use
      of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) as a preoperative adjunct. Although IVB is widely used as
      a preoperative adjunct in patients with PDR undergoing PPV, little clinical data is
      available regarding the optimal timing of preoperative IVB administration or the most
      effective dose. In this randomized prospective study, we attempt to elucidate the most
      appropriate interval and dose for the administration of preoperative IVB in patients with
      PDR undergoing PPV for non-clearing vitreous hemorrhaging, TRD or extensive fibrovascular
      proliferation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject age is 18-85 years.

          2. Subject consents to study participation and is capable of 6 months of follow-up.

          3. The subject has type I or II Diabetes Mellitus with active PDR in the study eye.

          4. Best-corrected spectacle visual acuity (BCSVA) on the Snellen eye chart ranges from
             20/40 to light perception with projection in the study eye.

          5. The subject is determined to need a PPV because of reduced BCSVA principally from a
             non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage, TRD, fibrous proliferation, or a combination of the
             three. When non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage is the principal reason for PPV, the
             hemorrhage must have been present by subjective history for at least 3 months. When
             TRD is the principal reason for PPV, the TRD must be threatening (within one disc
             diameter) or involving the fovea. When fibrovascular proliferation is the principal
             reason for PPV, it must be extensive (&gt;3 clock hours) and threatening (within one
             disc diameter) or involving the fovea.

          6. Only one eye per patient is eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is known to have a significant retinal/optic nerve disease otherwise
             unrelated to Diabetes Mellitus, which in the opinion of the examiner is responsible
             for two or more lines of reduced BCSVA (macular degeneration, optic neuritis,
             glaucoma, amblyopia, etc.) in the study eye.

          2. Subject is known to have macular ischemia, which in the opinion of the examiner, is
             responsible for two or more lines of reduced BCSVA in the study eye.

          3. Subject has a significant corneal opacity, which in the opinion of the examiner, is
             responsible for two or more lines of reduced BCSVA (corneal scar, ectasia, etc.) in
             the study eye.

          4. Subject is known to have had a macula-involving retinal detachment for greater than 6
             months in the study eye.

          5. Subject has had a previous vitrectomy (anterior or PPV) in the study eye.

          6. Subject has uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma (intraocular pressure &gt; 30 mmHg despite
             medical/surgical treatment) in the study eye.

          7. Subject received systemic or intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment to the study eye within
             3 months of anticipated study enrollment.

          8. Subject has uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt; 200 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 120 mmHg)
             despite adherence to a multiple anti-hypertensive medication regimen.
