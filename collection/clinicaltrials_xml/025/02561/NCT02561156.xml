  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      TAK-653 when administered as single and multiple oral doses at escalating dose levels in
      healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-653. TAK-653 is being tested to treat
      people who have depression. This study will look at the tolerability and PK of TAK-653 in
      healthy participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 72 participants. This study consists of 2 parts: Part 1-
      single-rising dose (SRD) consisting of 5 cohorts and Part 2- single and multiple rising dose
      (SRD/MRD) consisting of 4 cohorts. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) within each cohort to receive TAK-653 or placebo which will remain
      undisclosed to the participants and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need). Participants enrolled in Cohort 1 of Part 1 will receive TAK-653 0.3 mg or
      TAK-653 placebo-matching tablet once on Day 1. TAK-653 dose for subsequent cohorts in Part 1
      will be based on the data from the previous participants. Part 2 will be initiated only
      after review of all available safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) data
      collected in at least the first 3 SRD cohorts. All participants will be asked to take the
      drug at the same time each day on Day 1 for Part 1 and Day 1 and Days 6 to 18 in Part 2.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 14 days for Part 1 and 31 days for Part 2.
      Participants will be admitted to the clinic for 6 days in Part 1 and 22 days in Part 2.
      Participants will be followed up 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

          2. Signs and dates a written, informed consent form and any required privacy
             authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures including requesting
             that a participant fasts for any laboratory evaluations.

          3. Weighs at least 45 kilogram (kg) and has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and

          4. Male participant who is nonsterilized and sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed
             consent throughout the duration of the study and for 90 days after 5 half-lives have
             elapsed since last dose of study drug. This should be interpreted as 90 days from the

             the study, and for 30 days after 5 half-lives have elapsed since the last dose of
             study drug. This should be interpreted as 30 days from the Follow-up Call/Visit
             unless data indicates otherwise.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             safety, increase risk of seizure or lower the seizure threshold, or potentially
             confound the study results. It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess
             the clinical significance; however, consultation with the Takeda Medical Monitor may
             be warranted.
