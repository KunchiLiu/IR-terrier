  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Charcot Marie Tooth Disease is a family of inherited peripheral neuropathies, with over 70
      causative genes identified to date.1-4 Muscle cramps are frequent in CMT, affecting up to
      85% of patients with some subtypes of CMT. These cramps impact quality of life and have been
      identified as an important therapeutic target for clinical trials in CMT.1-4 There is no FDA
      approved treatment for muscle cramps.5 Mexiletine is a sodium channel blocker approved for
      treatment of arrhythmias. As a sodium channel blocker, mexiletine offers the promise of
      effective therapy for muscle cramps.

      This study will provide data on the short term efficacy of oral mexiletine in helping to
      prevent muscle cramps in adults with CMT. The study will also assess the short-term safety
      and tolerability of low dose mexiletine in adults with CMT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • • The subject has known CMT, previously diagnosed by a neurologist with
             subspeciality expertise in neuromuscular disorders/peripheral neuropathy. The
             diagnosis of CMT relies on a combination of clinical history (including family
             history), neurological examination electrophysiological features, and prior genetic
             testing results.

               -  The subject is at least 18 years old, and has signed the Informed Consent Form.

               -  The subject is ambulatory (cane, walker, orthoses allowed).

               -  The subject has experienced muscle cramps and has known provocable hamstring or
                  calf muscle cramps on MVC.

               -  The subject has a reliable method of birth control (if a female subject of child
                  bearing potential). Reliable birth control is defined as Hormonal contraception
                  Intrauterine contraception/device Any two barrier methods (combination of male
                  or female condom with diaphragm sponge or cervical cap) together with
                  spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository True abstinence

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • The subject has a known neuropathy from another source (e.g., diabetes, drug
             induced, alcohol, etc.).

               -  The subject has an untreated medical disorder known to predispose to muscle
                  cramps

               -  The subject is pregnant or nursing, has a known mexiletine allergy or has taken
                  mexiletine in the past 12 weeks.

               -  The subject is participating in another therapeutic trial.

               -  The subject has second or 3rd degree heart block, atrial flutter/fibrillation,
                  ventricular arrhythmias, or is receiving treatment of a cardiac arrhythmia.

               -  The subject is currently taking another agent for muscle cramps or a muscle
                  relaxant (e.g., benzodiazepine, baclofen, tizanidine, soma, meprobromate).

               -  The subject is on another sodium channel blocker or medication that precludes
                  administration of mexiletine.

               -  The subject has known diabetes mellitus, liver or kidney disease requiring
                  ongoing treatment, untreated thyroid dysfunction, symptomatic cardiomyopathy, or
                  symptomatic coronary artery disease.

               -  The subject, in the opinion of the investigator, is unsuitable for enrollment
                  for any other reason
