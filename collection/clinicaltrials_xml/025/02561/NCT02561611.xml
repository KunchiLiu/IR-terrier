  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the WorkACTIVE-P study is to assess the outcome of an innovative
      multi-component intervention focused on increasing energy expenditure and re-balancing the
      disrupted energy balance equation of sedentary workplaces with an ultimate target of
      reducing workers' abdominal obesity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The energy expenditure intervention includes replacing workplace sedentary time with access
      to a dedicated pedal desk and increasing steps/day with wearable monitors. Both components
      are incorporated into an electronically-delivered behavior monitoring and support
      infrastructure, thus enabling continuous management. The investigators will utilize
      pedaldesks manufactured and owned by Pennington Biomedical Research Center to conduct this
      study at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana offices in Baton Rouge, La. 40 individuals will
      be recruited and randomized to either a control arm or combined Walk More Pedal Desk (WMPD)
      intervention. Primary (MRI-determined visceral adipose tissue) and secondary (changes in
      body weight, total adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, blood pressure, blood
      lipids, fasting glucose and insulin, HbA1-c, free-living accelerometer-determined walking,
      time spent in sedentary behavior, exercise, and dietary intake) outcomes will be assessed at
      baseline and month 3.

    <description>Over the course of a 2-year period and working collaboratively with a real workplace, WorkACTIVE-P will randomly assign 40 low active (&lt; 7,500 steps/day), overweight/obese sedentary full-time workers (reporting &quot;mostly sitting&quot; during the work day), 40-64 years of age, with abdominal obesity defined by waist circumference and at least one additional component of the metabolic syndrome (dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and/or impaired fasting glucose12), to a 3-month-long controlled trial. The trial will include two intervention arms:
a combined electronic behavior support program of &quot;walk more and pedal desk&quot; (WMPD, n=20), which, in addition to provision of a dedicated pedal desk in individual worker's office space, participants are supported to increase daily walking by at least 3000 steps/day
a no-intervention control condition (CON, n=20).</description>
