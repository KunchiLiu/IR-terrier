  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Gambro Prismaflex®
      HF20 Set based on testing the hypothesis that it delivers sufficient renal replacement
      therapy to effectively treat acute kidney injury (AKI) in pediatric patients by reducing
      blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

&quot;TMP Excessive&quot; Caution At 72 hours from the initiation of HF20 study CRRT, the site may follow applicable institutional practices if additional CRRT is required.
Alarms from Prismaflex ® System 7.10 related to fluid balance will be noted and recorded for the following alarms:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a body weight ≥8 and &lt;20 kg (ie, ≥17.6 and &lt;44.09 lbs).

          2. Patients with acute kidney injury/failure. Acute renal failure will be defined as
             either 1) Acute Kidney Injury by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
             Acute Kidney Injury Guideline serum creatinine criteria, which is a &gt;50% rise in
             serum creatinine over baseline or a 0.3 mg/dl SCr rise in 48 hours, OR 2) as Acute
             Kidney Injury as defined by the pediatric modified RIFLE criteria (pRIFLE) which is a
             25% reduction in estimated creatinine clearance, OR 3) a serum creatinine &gt;1.2 mg/dl.

             OR Patients with severe fluid overload, defined as a &gt;10% Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
             fluid accumulation (based on ICU admission weight) will be included in the study (%
             fluid accumulation = [(Fluids In (liters) - Fluid Out (liters)/ICU admit weight (kg)
             * 100%]

          3. Patients who have received renal replacement therapy previously can be included in
             the study if &gt;72 hours have elapsed since previous RRT provision

          4. Provide written informed consent from one or both parents as required by the local
             IRB or a legal guardian unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent or not
             reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care
             and custody of the child per 21 CFR Part 50.55(e).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a hemoglobin of &lt;9 g/dl at the time of starting CRRT

          2. Children who are wards of the state

          3. Children undergoing or requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment
