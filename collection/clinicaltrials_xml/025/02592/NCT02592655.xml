  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cross-over study of twenty five healthy human subjects will utilize two active control
      devices, and two different widths of the investigational device. One active control is
      representative of the usual care tourniquet applied in hospital settings. The second active
      control is a windlass tourniquet representative of the pre-hospital and military usual care
      tourniquet device. Two inch and four inch widths of the investigational device will be
      evaluated. The purpose of this study is to characterize and compare investigational and
      control tourniquet safety and efficacy. All tourniquets will be applied to the upper thigh.
      Efficacy data is provided by the presence or absence of popliteal flow when assessed with
      ultrasound. Mapping of interface pressures between the skin and the tourniquet will provide
      safety data. A minimum washout of five minutes will be allowed between tourniquet
      applications. All interventions will be applied in one visit. No follow up visit is
      anticipated.

    <description>Each subject has been randomly allocated to 1 of the 24 possible sequences of the 4 interventions to be applied over the 4 periods (6, 4x4 Latin squares). The Automatic Tourniquet System (ATS) 1500 by Zimmer (formerly Aspen Labs) is a pneumatic tourniquet that is typically used in surgical settings, and is representative of best outcome under the ideal circumstances of a controlled environment.</description>

    <description>Each subject has been randomly allocated to 1 of the 24 possible sequences of the 4 interventions to be applied over the 4 periods (6, 4x4 Latin squares). The Special Operations Forces Tactical Tourniquet Wide (SOFTT-W) is 3.81 cm (1.5 inch) in width. The SOFTT-W is representative of the typical use device in civilian prehospital and military combat environments.
Single Windlass Tourniquet SOFTT-W If the interface pressure of the Single SOFTT-W is above 350 mmHg without achieving occlusion then a second SOFTT-W will be applied immediately proximal to the first. This is what is referred to as a Double Windlass Tourniquet SOFTT-W configuration.</description>

Battle Wrap Tourniquet Tape, 5.08 cm (2 inch) width is a highly elastic transparent occlusive material that can create circumferential pressure when stretched and wrapped around a limb. The tape should be stretched and overlapped by at least half the width as it is applied. The final wrap should be applied without tension.</description>
