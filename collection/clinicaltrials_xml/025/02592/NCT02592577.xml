      This first time in human study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who
      have advanced lung cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. In particular, it
      is a study for subjects who have a blood test positive for HLA-A*02:01 and/or HLA-A*02:06
      and a tumor test positive for MAGE A10 protein expression (protein or gene). The study will
      take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send
      them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the
      subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and
      destroying cancer cells.

      The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back
      to the subject through an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the
      safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in
      subjects with lung cancer. The study will evaluate three different cell dose levels in order
      to find out the target cell dose. Once the target cell dose is determined, additional
      subjects will be enrolled to further test the safety and effects at this cell dose.

      Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells
      back and up to first 6 months. After that, subjects will be seen every three months. If
      subjects have disease progression or withdraw from the study, they will then be entered into
      a long-term follow up for safety monitoring. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their
      Study Physician for the first 5 years after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in
      the blood at five years, then the subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T
      cells are no longer found in the blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no
      longer found in the blood at 5 years, then the subject will be contacted by the Study
      Physician for the next 10 years.

      This first time in human study is a single-arm study of genetically engineered MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T
      cells in HLA-A*02:01 and/or HLA-A*02:06 positive subjects with advanced (Stage IIIb or IV)
      NSCLC. Subjects with measurable disease will be screened for general health, performance
      status and disease stage. Following screening, subjects meeting all eligibility will undergo
      a large-volume leukapheresis to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous MAGE
      A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶TCR bearing T cells. When the MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells are available, subjects will
      receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on Days -7, Day
      -6, and Day -5 followed by the T cell infusion on Day 1.

      This trial is a dose escalation trial that will evaluate 3 doses of transduced cells
      administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen using a 3+3 dose escalation
      design. The doses for each cell dose group are as follows.

      Group 1a and 1b: 0.1 x 10⁹ (range: 0.08 x 10⁹-0.12 x 10⁹) transduced cells. Group 2: 1 x 10⁹
      (range: 0.8 x 10⁹- 1.2 x 10⁹) transduced cells. Group 3: 5 x 10⁹ (range: 1 x 10⁹- 6 x 10⁹)
      transduced cells.

      There will be a 21-day staggering of treatment in between treating subjects in Group 1 and a
      7-day stagger between treating subjects in Groups 2 and 3.

      NOTE: If a DLT occurs in Group 1 or Group 2 which requires expansion of the group (n=6),
      then a 14-day stagger would be implemented in Group 2 or 3, respectively. The study will
      enroll 12-24 subjects to evaluate DLTs and determine target dose. The sample size of the
      target cell dose may be expanded up to 10 subjects to characterize safety and any
      preliminary evidence of antitumor activity.

      Subjects will visit the clinic for safety assessments daily from T cell infusion (Day 1)
      through Day 5, Days 8, 10, 12, and then weekly until week 6 and then at 8, 10, 12, 16, 20
      and 24 weeks, and every 3 months until 2 years and then every 6 months until progression of
      their disease (or withdrawal of consent for the interventional portion of the study).

      Subjects who have a confirmed response (or have stable disease for &gt;4 months) but subsequent
      disease progression following the initial infusion and whose tumor continues to express the
      appropriate antigen target may be eligible for a second infusion.

      All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the Interventional Phase of the study, will
      enter a 15-year long-term follow-up phase for observation of delayed adverse events. All
      subjects will continue to be followed for overall survival during the long-term follow-up
      phase.
