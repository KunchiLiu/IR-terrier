  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preliminary laboratory science studies, the investigators show that proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) effectively inhibit human fatty acid synthase (FASN) and breast cancer
      cell survival. A preliminary retrospective study shows that PPI usage in breast cancer
      patients during chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival. The impact was most
      striking in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Thus, PPIs may be
      repositioned as safe and effective breast cancer drugs to enhance the effect of
      chemotherapy.

      Many of the hurdles that slow progress from target, to lead compound, to investigational
      agent, to standard therapy are not barriers for the PPIs. The PPIs are FDA-approved,
      chronically used, and well tolerated so the investigators can move quickly from the
      laboratory to a proof of concept clinical trial. Incorporating the PPIs into standard care
      will require more than the investigators propose here, but the investigators have already
      plotted the additional steps needed to truly impact patient care. If successful, the data
      gathered in this proposal will lend support to and guide development of a definitive
      randomized trial.

      Primary Objective

      • Estimate the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with triple negative
      breast cancer and FASN expression treated with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in
      combination with high dose omeprazole.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Quantify the number of patients with newly diagnosed TNBC with tumors that express
           FASN.

        -  Estimate the rate of pCR in patients with triple negative breast cancer (irrespective
           of FASN status) treated with standard NAC in combination with high dose omeprazole.

        -  Describe the safety of incorporating high dose omeprazole with standard NAC.

        -  Estimate the biologic activity of high dose omeprazole in modulating FASN expression
           and activity.

      This is a single arm Phase II study. Patients should begin therapy within 7 working days of
      study entry. Patients will be treated with omeprazole 80 mg orally twice a day (BID)
      beginning 4-7 days prior to chemotherapy and continuing until surgery. After the brief
      period of omeprazole monotherapy, patients will begin standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
      doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel
      (80 mg/m2) weekly x 12. Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) may be administered on a
      classical every 3 week or dose dense every 2 week (with growth factor support) schedule at
      the treating physician's discretion. Routine incorporation of carboplatin is not
      recommended, however use of carboplatin (AUC 6 on week 1, 4, 7, and 10) with paclitaxel is
      allowed at the treating investigator's discretion. Chemotherapy will be adjusted based on
      toxicity according to standard treatment guidelines. Patients with overt disease progression
      during AC should move immediately to paclitaxel therapy. Patients with disease progression
      during paclitaxel should proceed immediately to surgery.
