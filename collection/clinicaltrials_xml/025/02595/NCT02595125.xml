  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are contraceptive methods of long-acting (from 3 to 10 years
      depending on the model) and among the most effective. However, there are many obstacles to
      the use of IUDs including pain felt by patients during installation. Several medical means
      were studied without evidence of their efficacy in pain related to IUD insertion. In order
      to remove this brake, it's important to find another way to act against this pain. The
      direct technique is one of the techniques described by health professionals. It seems
      trusted by its users as a more reliable technique but also less painful for patients.
      However, there is no study available on its evaluation. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the interest of the direct technique in reducing the pain experienced by
      patients during installation.
