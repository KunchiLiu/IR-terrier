  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well temozolomide and capecitabine work compared
      to standard treatment with cisplatin and etoposide in treating patients with neuroendocrine
      carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas that has spread to other parts of the
      body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, capecitabine, cisplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Certain types of neuroendocrine carcinomas may respond better
      to treatments other than the current standard treatment of cisplatin and etoposide. It is
      not yet known whether temozolomide and capecitabine may work better than cisplatin and
      etoposide in treating patients with this type of neuroendocrine carcinoma, called non-small
      cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of cisplatin and etoposide versus the PFS
      of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate (RR) of cisplatin and etoposide versus the RR of temozolomide
      and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic
      neuroendocrine carcinomas.

      II. To assess the overall survival (OS) of cisplatin and etoposide versus the OS of
      temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.

      III. To evaluate the toxicities associated with the combination of temozolomide and
      capecitabine and the combination of cisplatin and etoposide, respectively, in patients with
      advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of each treatment regimen on PFS, RR and OS based on marker of
      proliferation Ki-67 (Ki-67) index in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas. (Laboratory) II. To assess the prognostic
      significance of well differentiated versus poorly differentiated non-small cell
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in relationship to survival and response to
      treatment. (Laboratory) III. To assess the agreement in marker of proliferation Ki-67
      (Ki-67) status between that reported by institutional pathologist and that reported by
      central pathology review. (Laboratory)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and
      temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 10-14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes and
      etoposide IV over approximately 60 minutes on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

For the series of Ki-67 values observed in the data, Youden's index will be calculated and with the highest index the threshold that minimizes the false positive and false negative rates for best detecting prolonged OS will be identified. Optimal cutoff values of Ki-67 with respect to response to temozolomide and capecitabine, positive octreotide scans, and negative PET scans will also be determined in a similar manner.</description>
