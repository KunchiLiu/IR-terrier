    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related [ATR]
      kinase inhibitor VX-970 (VX-970) and gemcitabine hydrochloride work compared to standard
      treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back after a period of improvement
      (recurrent). ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking an
      enzyme needed for cell growth, and may also help gemcitabine hydrochloride work better.
      Gemcitabine hydrochloride is a drug used in chemotherapy that works to stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking cells from growing and repairing themselves, causing them to die. It
      is not yet known whether adding ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 to standard treatment with
      gemcitabine hydrochloride is more effective than gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating
      patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess and compare progression free survival (PFS) between gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride)/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine and compare overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) between gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone arms.

      II. Determine and compare the safety profile of gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone
      regimens.

      III. Assess and compare PFS at 6 months between gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone
      arms.

      IV. Determine and compare the clinical benefit rate (CBR) between gemcitabine/VX-970 and
      gemcitabine alone arms.

      V. Determine and compare the duration of response (DOR) between gemcitabine/VX-970 and
      gemcitabine alone arms.

      VI. Determine and compare cancer antigen (CA)125 reduction by &gt;= 50% between
      gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine alone arms.

      VII. Determine and compare overall survival (OS) between gemcitabine/VX-970 and gemcitabine
      alone arms.

      VIII. Determine the ORR for subjects in the gemcitabine alone arm who cross over to the
      gemcitabine/VX-970 arm.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients experiencing disease progression may crossover to Arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride as in Arm I and ATR kinase inhibitor
      VX-970 IV over 60-90 minutes on days 2 and 9. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
