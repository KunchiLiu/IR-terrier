    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to collect further information regarding an increase immune
      response of SP284 after an additional dose in Japanese subjects.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate and describe the immune responses to meningococcal antigens (serogroups
           A,C, Y and W-135) at 28 days following each vaccination with SP284 vaccine in subjects
           20 through 55 years of age.

      Other Pre-specified objective:

        -  To describe the safety in terms of immediate systemic adverse events, solicited
           reactions, unsolicited non-serious adverse events, and serious adverse events (SAEs)
           following receipt of each dose of SP284 vaccine in persons 20 through 55 years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive a 2-dose series of the study vaccine at 8-week interval and will
      be monitored for safety and assessed for immunogenicity at baseline (pre-vaccination), at 28
      to 35 days post-1st and 2nd vaccination, respectively.
