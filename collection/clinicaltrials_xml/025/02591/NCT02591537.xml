    <textblock>
      Twelve acute wounds (6 on either side of the umbilicus) will be surgically created in the
      lower abdominal area. One side of the umbilicus will be randomized to Oxygenesys treatment
      arm and the other side will be receiving a standard Tegaderm treatment arm. Time to wound
      healing will be observed over 14 days.

      At least 12 study visits will occur over a 3 month timeframe. Twelve acute wounds (6 on
      either side of the umbilicus) will be surgically created in the lower abdominal area. One
      side of the umbilicus will be randomized to Oxygenesys treatment arm and the other side will
      be receiving a standard Tegaderm treatment arm. Time to wound healing will be observed over
      14 days (follow up assessments include wound photography, pain scores, wound biopsies,
      exudate collection, gene expression and proteomic analysis, scar assessment and adverse
      event collections. Study visits will occur at:

      Prescreening Visit; Day of wounding; Day 2; Day 7; Day 8-14 (until all wounds have healed);
      Day 28; Day 42; Day 90; Abdominoplasty Surgery. An abdominoplasty will occur after day 90.

    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Scar quality will be assessed and analyzed between the two groups using the Modified Vancouver Scar Scale at day 28, 42 and 90. The MVS assessment is the tool that the Investigator will use to evaluate scar pliability, height, vascularity and pigmentation.</description>

    <measure>Scar Quality Analysis; Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Scar quality will be assessed and analyzed between the two groups using the Visual Analogue Scale at day 28, 42 and 90. The Visual Analogue Scale will contain varying degrees of smiley faces so the subject can relate their pain to a corresponding visual face.</description>

    <measure>Scar Quality Analysis; Elastometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Scar quality will be assessed and analyzed between the two groups using the Elastometer at day 28, 42 and 90. An elastometer is a device the Investigator will use to assess how elastic the scar area is .</description>

    <measure>Scar Quality Analysis; Cutometer and Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Scar quality will be assessed and analyzed between the two groups using the Cutometer and sensation at day 28, 42 and 90. A cutometer is a device will be used to measure physical properties of the skin. Scar sensation will also be noted.</description>

             of the final study dressing.

          -  Subject is willing to undergo the creation of twelve experimental donor sites 1.0&quot; x
             1.0&quot; in size with a depth between 0.0012&quot;-0.0018&quot; taken from the abdomen per a
             modification of the Northwestern Abdominoplasty Scar Model

          -  Subjects who are medically acceptable candidates for abdominoplasty (BMI
             approximately 25-35 kg/m2) as determined by per-study laboratory assessment and
             clinical evaluation.

          -  Willingness to provide informed consent and to comply with the requirements of this
             protocol for the full duration of the study.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes (A1C &gt; 8%).

             (&gt;1 pack-year).

             interfere with the assessment of safety, tolerability or efficacy.

          -  Subjects who have previously had skin grafts harvested from the area to be studied.

          -  Subjects with a skin disorder (other than chronic venous ulcers) that is chronic or
             currently active and which the Investigator considers will adversely affect the
             healing of the acute wounds or involves the areas to be examined in this trial.

          -  Subjects with extensive severe striae that would make it difficult to perform a skin
             graft on the abdomen and/or evaluate the final scar appearance.

          -  Subjects with a history of clinical significant hypersensitivity to any of the
             surgical dressings to be used in this trial.

          -  Subjects who are taking, or have taken any Investigational drugs within 3 months
             prior to the screening visit.

          -  Subjects who are participating in other research Investigations.

          -  Subjects requiring treatment with medications(s) that are known to interfere with
             wound healing.

             lactating.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are not likely to complete the
             trial for whatever reason, including significant comorbidities that may adversely
