      The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of MENOPUR® versus recombinant
      Follicle Stimulating Hormone (rFSH) (Gonal-f®) with respect to ongoing pregnancy rate in
      women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) following GnRH treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females aged 21 to 35 years with regular ovulatory menstrual cycles of 21 to 45 days,
             with a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 who desire pregnancy.

          -  Subjects must be high responders, defined as subjects who have a serum anti-Müllerian
             hormone (AMH) ≥5 ng/mL at screening.

          -  Documented history of infertility (e.g., unable to conceive for at least 12 months or
             for at least 6 months if receiving donor sperm) with a Day 2 or Day 3 serum FSH level
             between 1 and 12 IU/L (inclusive), the results of which should be obtained within 6
             months prior to randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known stage III-IV endometriosis (American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2012).

          -  History of recurrent miscarriage not followed by a live birth (recurrent is defined
             as two (2) or more consecutive miscarriages).

          -  Previous in vitro fertilization (IVF) or assisted reproductive technology (ART)
             failure due to a poor response to gonadotropins. Poor response is defined as
             development of ≤2 mature follicles or history of 2 previous failed cycle
             cancellations prior to oocytes retrieval due to poor response.
