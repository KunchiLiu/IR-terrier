  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the efficacy of a brief, 11-week, manualized Taming Sneaky Fears for
      Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and/or Selective Mutism (SM) child and parent group Cognitive
      Behavioural Therapy (CBT) treatment protocol. Children 4 to 7 years old (n = 88) meeting
      criteria for SAD and/or SM, and their parents are recruited from the Psychiatry Outpatient
      Program and participants will be randomized to either the Taming Sneaky Fears group or a
      parent psycho-education and child socialization group. Trained clinicians blinded to all
      measures and treatment assignment will administer pre, post and 6-month follow-up outcome
      measures. Investigators assess within-the-child and within-the-parent/environment factors
      that predict treatment outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This study utilizes a repeated measures, longitudinal, randomized controlled trial design to
      compare the efficacy of two interventions in the treatment of children aged 4 to 7 years
      with SM and/or SAD. Participants are randomized into either the:

        1. Taming Sneaky Fears for SAD and/or SM parent and child group CBT treatment, or

        2. the Parent Psycho-education and Child Socialization comparison program.

      Both programs run for 10 consecutive weeks (plus one additional introduction week). To
      control for the nonspecific factors associated with treatment, such as the support,
      attention and expectation of improvement, parents and children in both treatment protocols
      receive comparable levels of attention from therapists (i.e., same duration of group
      sessions and total number of sessions with a therapist) and comparable opportunities for
      socialization (e.g., for the children: invitation to discuss how the previous week went,
      snack time, story time; for the parents: discussion of specific topics at each session).
      However, parents and children in the comparison group are not taught CBT strategies.
