    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, multi-center study to determine the efficacy and safety of
      MEDI4736 evaluated as single agent or in combination with tremelimumab in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) whose disease has progressed on
      fluoropyrimidine containing or gemcitabine-containing first-line chemotherapy.This study
      will consist of Part A, lead-in, as well as a possible expansion Part B.
