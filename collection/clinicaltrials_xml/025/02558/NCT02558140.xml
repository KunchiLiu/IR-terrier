  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study consists of three parts. The primary purpose of Part I is to
      characterize the safety and tolerability of RO6874813 in participants with locally advanced
      and/or metastatic solid tumors whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy or for
      whom no standard therapy exists. In addition, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) will be determined. In Part II the safety and tolerability
      of RO6874813 will continue to be characterized in participants with locally advanced and/or
      metastatic solid tumors known to be fibroblast activation protein-alpha positive (FAP+). In
      addition, treatment-induced efficacy effects of RO6874813 will be assessed by functional
      imaging and paired tumor biopsies. The primary purpose of Part III is to demonstrate
      anti-tumor activity of RO6874813 in participants with recurrent or metastatic FAP+ sarcomas.

    <description>All participants will be given a single low dose of 0.5 mg/kg RO6874813 in a 7-day pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in period (Cycle 0). This is followed by dose escalation (Cycle 1) for which decisions and selection of the dose for the next cohort of patients will be made following review of all relevant available data, including dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) information and be guided by the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) recommendation.</description>

    <description>The first 15 participants with fibroblast activation protein-alpha positive (FAP+) tumors treated at the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and dosing schedule as defined in Part I will undergo paired tumor biopsies for biomarker assessments. Up to 5 patients will undergo baseline and on-treatment tumor biopsies for biomarker assessments at a dose below the RP2D. Tumor biopsy and imaging assessment will be performed at baseline and on-treatment during Cycle 2, and Cycles 2 plus 4, respectively.</description>

    <description>A single low dose of 0.5 mg/kg will be administered by intravenous infusion in a 7-day run-in period (Cycle 0). Dose escalation will start with 1 participant per dose level until evidence of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCA) &gt;= G2 toxicity or dose level of 5 mg/kg is reached (whatever comes first). For all further cohorts (&gt;=5mg/kg) a minimum of 3 participants will be used. The first participant at each dose level will receive a single dose of RO6874813 and must have completed at least the first 5 days of Cycle 1 (Days 1-5) without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) before the next participants within this cohort are treated simultaneously at this dose level.</description>
