  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomized, single-blind (investigator is blinded), active (the
      combination therapy of adapalene [ADA] and clindamycin [CLDM])-controlled and parallel-group
      study in Japanese subjects with facial acne vulgaris. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CLDM 1 percent (%)-benzoyl peroxide 3%
      (Duac®: trademark owned by GlaxoSmithKline) once daily fixed dose combination gel versus
      combination therapy of ADA 0.1% gel and CLDM 1% gel in the topical treatment of facial acne
      vulgaris for 12 weeks. A total of 400 subjects will be screened for enrolment. Subjects will
      use Duac® fixed dose combination gel with quantity sufficient to cover entire face
      (including the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin) once daily in the evening (at bedtime) or
      combination therapy of ADA 0.1% gel with quantity sufficient to cover entire face (including
      the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin) once daily in the evening (at bedtime) and CLDM 1% gel
      twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening (at bedtime) for 12 weeks.
