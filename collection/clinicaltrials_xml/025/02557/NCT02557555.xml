  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how the investigators can better educate pregnant
      patients about the options open to them for pain relief during labor. Patients will receive
      educational pamphlet during prenatal clinic visit and again on admission to labor and
      delivery. The options for analgesia will be discussed by anesthesia care provider. Patient
      will be asked to complete a survey on the post partum unit.

      Many analgesic options exist for laboring parturients, but labor may not be the best time to
      start informing patients of their options. Many patients begin the labor process with a plan
      in place for their analgesia. Unfortunately, internet resources regarding labor analgesia
      that are available to the lay parturient are poor and often lead to misconceptions about the
      options and their risks. A significant number of patients refuse neuraxial analgesia based
      on misunderstandings, concerns about the procedure, or a lack of faith in the provider. Some
      women want a &quot;natural childbirth&quot; and/or control over their labor experience. Forty-seven
      percent of minority women feel inadequately educated about anesthesia, are less likely to
      trust physicians, and are less likely to receive epidurals. However, greater than 10% of
      obese women changed their preference toward epidural analgesia following antenatal
      consultation. Also, 50% of patients planning for analgesia-free labor request neuraxial
      analgesia after experiencing labor pain.3 Additionally, the question exists as to the
      quality of informed consent from a patient undergoing contraction pain and possible sedation
      from analgesic medications. The consensus is that parturients can provide informed consent.
      However, the process of informed consent for labor analgesia is not standardized; the
      options and risks presented to patients are dependent upon the individual practitioner
      obtaining the consent. Regarding epidurals, patients want to be informed of all risks and
      complications associated with the procedure. The patient's recall of the risks and benefits
      of the epidural procedure improved by 50% with written material in addition to verbal
      discussion, and recall improved by more than a factor of five when consent during labor was
      preceded by antenatal education. Parturients want a &quot;pre-operative&quot; visit with an
      anesthesiologist and have a strong desire for pre-labor education of anesthesia/analgesia
      options. Early antenatal education allows for time to teach, relieves anxiety, develops
      rapport, and provides opportunities for additional testing, if needed. Finally, the timing
      of epidural placement has not been shown to change outcomes, but when initiated late in the
      labor process, often other analgesia modalities were used that confounded the analysis of
      outcomes. Therefore, earlier request, which may come with prior knowledge and avoidance of
      misconceptions, and earlier placement of epidurals may lead to fewer analgesic interventions
      in the parturient and possibly less morbidity for the patient and fetus. The investigators
      will provide information of available labor analgesia options (epidural, combined
      spinal/epidural, spinal, remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia, and intravenous opioids)
      to expecting mothers. Using a pamphlet written in English or Spanish disseminated to
      pregnant women in clinic and upon arrival in the labor and delivery unit, the procedures and
      their risks and benefits will be explained in simple terms. In the Labor and Delivery Unit
      the patients will have an opportunity to ask questions of the anesthesia care giver
      regarding the options for analgesia. After delivery while on F Green, patients will be asked
      to complete a questionnaire addressing their thoughts about the pamphlets and their overall
      satisfaction with their labor analgesia. The analysis will focus on the utility and effect
      of education materials on maternal informed consent for labor analgesia, on maternal choice
      of analgesia modality, and on maternal anxiety regarding their labor analgesia plan.
