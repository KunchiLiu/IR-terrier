  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is important because it allows for the determination of resistance rates to
      antibiotics that may not be frequently tested by the clinical microbiology laboratory at
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)-Presbyterian. It also will provide antibiotic
      minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for these pathogens which may help in identifying
      the best empiric antibiotic option for gram-negative blood stream infections based on known
      pharmacodynamic parameters.

    <textblock>
      Bacterial cultures will be ordered in the normal clinical course of the management of
      patients in the liver transplant ICU by the medical team. These cultures are then processed
      by the clinical Microbiology laboratory in the normal manner. If these cultures grow a
      Gram-negative bacteria, they are eligible for this study. Typically the clinical
      Microbiology laboratory saves these bacteria for a period of time after the final
      microbiology report. At this time, unless asked otherwise, the bacteria will be placed in
      biohazardous waste containers for proper disposal. If these cultures have grown a
      Gram-negative bacteria, they are eligible for this study, and will not be disposed of but
      will be given to the investigators without identifiers for this study. The antibiotic
      susceptibility of these organisms will be tested by the investigators in a separate research
      laboratory. Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance may also be assessed.

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be
      kept in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.
