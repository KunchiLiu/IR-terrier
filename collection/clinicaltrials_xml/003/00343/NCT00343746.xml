      The purpose of this research is to evaluate optical coherence tomography (OCT) and FDA
      approved device used to image diseases of the eye. The ultra-high resolution OCT is a
      non-significant risk device used in this study. Optical Coherence Tomography may be useful
      for early diagnosis and monitoring of different types of eye diseases.
