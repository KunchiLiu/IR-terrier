  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is aimed at investigating the relative diagnostic and synergy of four state of
      the art breast imaging techniques (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), full-field digital
      mammography (DMAM), ultrasound, and positron emission tomography (PET)) with respect to
      determining the extent of breast cancer.
