      This study uses a sequence of high-dose chemotherapy drugs and a stem cell transplant to
      treat multiple myeloma. The study is being performed to evaluate the efficacy and side
      effects of treatment. Specifically, the study is designed to reduce the risk of interstitial
      pneumonitis.

    <textblock>
      We have performed over 200 autologous HCT for myeloma at Stanford using high-dose sequential
      therapy with a BCNU dose of 550 mg/m2 plus melphalan 200 mg/m2. Analysis of 196 patients
      treated this way demonstrates a median event-free survival of 36 months with a median
      overall survival of more than six years. The main toxicity of this therapy is related to
      BCNU-pneumonitis or interstitial pneumonitis (IP). This complication is related to the dose
      of BCNU and is well described in the literature(18). In our myeloma patients treated with
      this dose of BCNU the incidence of IP is 34%.

      There have been recent studies evaluating the role of tandem autologous transplants for
      patients with multiple myeloma. These trials were based upon the hypothesis that performing
      tandem high-dose therapy regimens would lead to increased tumor cell kill, decreased tumor
      burden and an improvement in overall survival(9, 19). There are trials comparing single to
      double transplants that suggest there may be a benefit for tandem autologous transplants for
      event-free survival and overall survival (20-22). However, our results with high-dose
      sequential therapy including the dose-intense BCNU/Melphalan transplant demonstrates similar
      median event-free survival and overall survival when compared with the results of tandem
      transplant approaches.

      The proposed trial will continue to use a high-dose sequential transplant approach, however,
      we will use a reduced dose of BCNU which we expect to be associated with a lower incidence
      of IP.
