      OBJECTIVE— The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated the powerful
      impact of glycemic control on the early manifestations of microvascular complications.

      Contemporary prospective data on the evolution of macrovascular and late micro vascular
      complications of type 1 diabetes are limited. The Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and
      Complications (EDIC) study is a multicenter, longitudinal, observational study designed to
      use the well-characterized DCCT cohort of 1,400 patients to determine the long-term effects
      of prior separation of glycemic levels on micro- and macrovascular outcomes. EDIC is in its
      13th year of followup. The study is expecting to last until 2016.

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS— Using a standardized annual history and physical examination,
      28 EDIC clinical centers that were DCCT clinics will follow the EDIC cohort for 10 years.
      Annual evaluation also includes resting electro c a rdiogram, Doppler ultrasound
      measurements of ankle/arm blood pressure, and screening for nephropathy. At regular
      intervals, a timed 4-h urine is collected, lipid pro files are obtained, and stereoscopic
      fundus photographs are taken. In addition, dual B-mode Doppler ultrasound scans of the
      common and internal carotid arteries will be perf o rmed at years 1 and 6 and at study end.

      During the DCCT, the frequency of cardiovascular events was too low to determine whether the
      interventions had significantly different effects. During EDIC, two measures of
      atherosclerosis were employed, ultrasound measurement of carotid intima-media wall thickness
      (IMT) and electron beam (or multidetector) computed tomography of the heart to measure
      coronary artery calcification. The progression of IMT during EDIC was decreased in the
      former intensive therapy group compared with the former conventional therapy group.
      Similarly, the prevalence of coronary calcification was less in the former intensive
      treatment group. Both measures were associated with level of glycemia, measured by HbA1c,
      during the DCCT, independent of other established cardiovascular risk factors. The frequency
      of major CVD clinical events (defined as any one of the following: fatal and non-fatal
      myocardial infarctions and stroke, silent myocardial infarctions, angina confirmed by a
      positive stress test or catheterization, and PTCA or CABG) has increased during EDIC.
      Preliminary analysis of the clinical events has shown differences between the two DCCT
      treatment groups that support a benefit of intensive therapy on clinical CVD outcomes, as
      previously demonstrated for atherosclerosis. Collaboration with the Medical University of
      South Carolina, supported by an NHLBI Program Project, has explored inflammatory, lipid, and
      hemorheologic risk factors for micro- and macrovascular disease during EDIC.

      The rate of mortality in the DCCT cohort has been low. The number of events has been too
      small to provide a definitive assessment of the possible effects of the initial intensive
      versus conventional therapy during DCCT on risk of mortality, or to assess the association
      of other complications, principally nephropathy, on risk of mortality. However, projections
      over the next 10 years suggest that an adequate number of deaths are expected to allow an
      assessment of the effects of previous DCCT therapy, the history of glycemia and emergence of
      other complications on the risk of mortality.

      COLLABORATIONS- The DCCT/EDIC Research Group has sought to amplify the clinical science
      opportunities afforded by the extensive clinical data collected during DCCT/EDIC. Four
      important collaborations have extended and expanded our collection of data relevant to CVD.

        1. Our collaborators at The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) have obtained 3
           samples of specially preserved plasma at different time points from approximately 1000
           EDIC participants for measurement of multiple risk factors, including nuclear magnetic
           resonance lipoprotein profiles. Many of these assays have already been performed and
           await correlation analyses with CVD events and their surrogates.

        2. Our collaborators at University of Washington have received serum from 85-90% of the
           participants every 2 years throughout the DCCT and EDIC for fractionation of
           lipoproteins by gradient ultracentrifugation. One of the MUSC collaborators, now at
           University of Oklahoma, has added characterization of apoproteins important in
           lipoprotein metabolism.

        3. In addition to the biochemical data generated by our collaborators at MUSC and the
           University of Washington, a DCCT/EDIC Genetics Project has been initiated. (A proposal
           for continuation of the genetics project will be submitted separately). Our
           collaborators at the Hospital for Sick Children/University of Toronto have received DNA
           from virtually all the participants and from 2918 first degree relatives, representing
           87% of the relatives who were not available and did not refuse to provide their DNA
           outright (25% of all relatives). Genetic analyses for genes influencing CVD are being
           conducted by 3 approaches: population based association in the DCCT/EDIC probands with
           candidate genes; &quot;trios&quot; analysis with probands and their parents and siblings; family
           based associations with multiplex families in whom relatives have also been previously
           clinically phenotyped for complications.

        4. A collaboration with investigators located in several centers, including UCSF, that
           focuses on urologic and sexual dysfunction in diabetes (Uro-EDIC) has yielded important
           new insights.

      In addition to the major, planned collaborations above, the DCCT/EDIC Research Group has
      made its phenotypic data and saved samples available to outside investigators for almost a
      decade. The DCCT/EDIC Research Group is also collaborating with the repositories recently
      established by NIDDK to share phenotypic data, genetic samples, and other biologic samples,
      as available, with external investigators.
