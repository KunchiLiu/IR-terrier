  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and immunogenicity of 2 candidate malaria vaccines
      administered according to 3 different vaccination schedules in 5 to 17 months old Ghanaian
      children. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment
      Act, Sep 2007.

      This study will be conducted in a partially blind fashion: it will be observer-blind as to
      which vaccine was administered, and open as to the vaccination schedule. One group of
      children on the 0, 1, 2-schedule will receive a Rabies vaccine as a control. One group on
      the same schedule will receive the RTS,S/AS02D experimental vaccine as an active comparator.

             comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Proof that child has received a full 3-dose regimen of licensed Hepatitis B vaccine
             in infancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment.

          -  Serious acute or chronic illness determined by clinical or physical examination and
             laboratory screening tests.

          -  Laboratory screening tests for haemoglobin, total white cell count, platelets, ALT
             and creatinine out of acceptable limits.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine (not in the scope of the study)
             within 30 days of the first dose of vaccine(s) with the exception of tetanus toxoid
             or scheduled Yellow fever or Measles vaccine.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study
             vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of the study vaccine, or planned use
             during the study period.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins, blood transfusions or other blood products within
             the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration
             during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the first vaccine dose.

          -  Simultaneous participation in any other clinical trial;

          -  Previous participation in any other malaria vaccine trial;

          -  Any twins

          -  History of allergic reactions (significant IgE-mediated events) or anaphylaxis to
             previous immunizations.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  Any other findings that the investigator feels would increase the risk of having an
             adverse outcome from participation in the trial.
