      The purpose of this trial is to study the effectiveness of an immunosuppressive drug,
      sirolimus, in the treatment of chronic graft versus host disease in combination with
      prednisone. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a common complication in patients who have
      received blood or marrow transplantation from a related or unrelated donor. Chronic GVHD
      occurs approximately 100 days after transplantation and is the result of the donor immune
      system recognizing the patient's tissues as foreign and creating harmful effects on the
      patient';s organs. We hope the use of sirolimus will decrease the significant disabling
      effects and deaths caused by chronic GVHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:- Histologically-confirmed active chronic GVHD &gt;100 days following
        allogeneic bone marrow/peripheral blood/umbilical cord blood transplantation that has
        failed prior therapy. In the event that histological confirmation poses undue risk,
        clinical evaluation is sufficient.

             of child-bearing potential agree to use a medically acceptable contraceptive
             throughout the treatment period and for 3 months after discontinuation of sirolimus.
             Any woman becoming pregnant during the treatment period must discontinue the use of
             sirolimus.
