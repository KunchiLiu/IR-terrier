    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the clinical application of a new device that
      records pH changes in the hypopharynx. The investigators also aim to compare the consistency
      of distal esophageal pH with hypopharyngeal pH using both the &quot;short&quot; and the &quot;long&quot;
      catheters in patients.

    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been linked to many disorders and can be
      diagnosed through a variety of modalities utilizing 24 hour ambulatory pH monitoring which
      can register the duration, pattern and symptom correlation of distal esophageal acid
      exposure. This can be accomplished via a catheter probe connected from outside the body and
      placed through a nostril, advanced past the hypopharynx and down into the distal esophagus.
      Or, a small pH detector temporarily implanted in the distal esophagus during endoscopy can
      record reflux events. However, despite available technologies, there has long been a
      deficiency in detecting extra-esophageal reflux in the upper esophagus/ hypopharynx. This is
      of interest for gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists, and pulmonologists in the evaluation
      of extra-esophageal reflux as a potential culprit for asthma, chronic cough, laryngitis,
      globus, and non-cardiac chest pain. Until now, there has not been a device sensitive enough
      for accurately detecting extra-esophageal reflux and clinicians have relied upon subjective
      response to empiric treatment with acid reducing medications to determine whether acid
      reflux was at the root of the symptoms. There are currently no well designed published
      studies with this device to assess its role in this group of difficult to treat patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female volunteers aged 18 to 65 years old.

          2. Control group: No known history of GERD or EERD or prior PPI use.

          3. GERD group: Patients with known history of GERD based on prior response to either
             histamine inhibitors (H2 blockers) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and/or endoscopic
             esophagitis identified at endoscopy.

          4. EERD group: Patients with chronic cough, asthma and laryngeal findings felt to be
             GERD related.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of H2 blockers or PPIs within one week prior to and during the study for the GERD
             and EERD patients. No prior PPI use is allowed for the control population.

          2. Use of antacids (Rolaids, Tums, Pepto-Bismol, etc.) within one day prior to or during
             the study.

          3. Esophageal motility abnormalities (achalasia, esophageal spasm, severe dysphagia)

          4. Expected non-compliance.

          5. Positive history of ongoing alcohol or tobacco use and inability to refrain from
             using either during study duration (24 hours).

          6. Recent nasal surgery or nasal obstruction.

          7. Significant medical conditions that, in the investigator's judgment, would compromise
             the subject's health and safety (mental disability, psychiatric impairment, inability
             to read or comprehend the consent form)
