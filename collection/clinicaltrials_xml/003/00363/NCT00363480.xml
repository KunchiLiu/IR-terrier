  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of asthma patients are not well controlled, despite the availability of asthma
      medication that could effectively treat the disease. In this study uncontrolled patients who
      are steroid-naive or on low dose inhaled corticosteroids will be treated with Seretide
      (salmeterol/fluticasone combination, SFC) 50/250 µg twice daily. The asthma control test
      (ACT) will be used to detect differences in the level of asthma control during treatment.
      The study aims to show a correlation between improvements of ACT und the level of asthma
      control which will be reached by the patients.

      The aim of the study is to show that most of symptomatic asthma patients can reach 'well
      controlled asthma' with SFC. We get information about ACT in daily practice and physicians
      are trained to use the asthma control test as a screening tool and for follow up of asthma
      management. Correlations are expected between the improvements in ACT, Quality of Life and
      asthma control according to the Gaining Optimal Asthma controL (GOAL) criteria.

    <description>A week with well controlled asthma, when two or more of the criteria were fulfilled (diary entries): At most 2 days per week with 24-hour symptom score &gt;1 (Range: 0= None to 5= severe), rescue salbutamol use on &lt;= 2 days and at most 4 occasions per week, and a morning peak flow &gt;= 80% of the predicted value on each day per week. All of the criteria which includes no night-time awakenings due to asthma (diary entry), no emergency visits (diary entry), no exacerbations and no treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment change are fulfilled. The total ACT score is based on a range of 5 to 25. A score of 19 or less may be a sign that asthma symptoms are not under control.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 3) up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>For the level of asthma control, baseline values were derived taking the last 8 weeks during the pre-treatment period prior to Visit 3 into consideration. Regarding derived variables based on the asthma diary, data from the last week prior to Visit 3 was taken. Visit 3, regarded as baseline. AQLQ has 32 questions regarding activities, emotions, symptoms, and environmental triggers. Each item values range from 1 (maximum impairment) to 7 (no impairment).</description>

    <description>Correlation between change in the AQLQ and ACT score was tabulated using the Pearson coefficient of correlation (linear correlation). The AQLQ contained 32 items in 4 domains: activity limitation, symptoms, emotional function and environmental stimuli. Scores for the domains as well as the overall score were scaled within a range of 1 (worst) to 7 (best).</description>
