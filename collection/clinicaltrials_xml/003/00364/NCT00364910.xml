      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy in treating
      people who are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a heart attack.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD usually develops in people who have experienced a traumatic or life-threatening event,
      including a health scare like a heart attack or catheterization. Symptoms of PTSD typically
      include anxiety, anger, and flashbacks or nightmares. PTSD symptoms are also associated with
      poor medical outcomes and nonadherence to medication after a heart attack. Fortunately, PTSD
      can sometimes be treated by antidepressants, anti-anxiety medication, and talk therapy. This
      study will compare the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) versus education and
      treatment as usual for treating people who are experiencing PTSD that is related to their
      cardiovascular illness (a heart attack or an invasive procedure such as catheterization).

      Participants in this single-blind study will receive a psychiatric evaluation during which
      post-traumatic symptoms and feelings regarding their cardiovascular illness will be
      evaluated. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either CBT or a single
      educational session about PTSD, with up to 2 more follow-up educational meetings if needed.
      Participants assigned to the educational session will attend one meeting with a researcher
      to discuss the results from their evaluation. If they choose, they will also be referred to
      a mental health clinic for further care. Participants assigned to receive CBT will meet with
      a therapist once a week for at least 3 weeks. Participants will be offered the chance to
      meet with their therapist for two additional sessions if they need more time to discuss
      their symptoms. All participants will be re-evaluated at Months 2 and 6 using an interview,
      questionnaires,blood tests, blood pressure readings, and weight measurements.
