      To study the feasibility of Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) via ultrasound guidance in the
      treatment of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around 23,000 cases of thyroid cancer are discovered annually in the US, and PTC accounts
      for 70-75% of those cases. The conventional treatment consists mainly of surgical resection,
      in the form of lobectomy with/without isthmusectomy, or total thyroidectomy, making it one
      of the most commonly performed procedures. It has high costs, and exposes the patients to
      morbidity of surgery and anesthesia. PTC tends to be indolent with a 90% cure rate and
      controversy exists regarding extent of treatment.

      Percutaneous image-guided RFA has received increasing attention as a promising minimally
      invasive technique for the treatment of focal malignant disease. It permits the in situ
      destruction of tumors without necessitating their surgical excision.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18-90 years old

          -  Patients with low risk well-differentiated PTC, diagnosed by US guided FNA, and whose
             management decision is total thyroidectomy.

          -  Patients with only one dominant malignant nodule will be included in the study.

          -  Patients with size of their thyroid nodule ranging only between 1-4cm in diameter
             will be included in the study.

          -  Patients with nodules located only in between the mid and lower pole of the thyroid
             gland will be included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  When the patient does not meet the inclusion criteria.

          -  When the patient has a contra-indication of surgery or anesthesia.

          -  If the patient refuses involvement in the study.
