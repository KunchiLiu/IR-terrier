    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Male or female subject who has successfully completed the 12 Month Visit of 49653/461
             (12 months of treatment) without tolerability issues, where in the opinion of the
             subject and of the investigator, it will be beneficial to continue treatment with RSG
             XR.

          -  Female subjects must be post-menopausal (i.e. &gt;6 months without menstrual period),
             surgically sterile, or if of child-bearing potential, using effective contraceptive
             measures (oral contraceptives, Norplant, Depo-Provera, an intra-uterine device (IUD)
             a diaphragm with spermicide or a condom with spermicide). Women of childbearing
             potential must use effective contraceptive measures throughout the study and for 30
             days after discontinuing study medication. The subject and their caregiver must
             ensure that the subject will continuously use contraceptive measures throughout the
             duration of the study.

          -  Subject is willing to participate in the extension study and has provided full
             written informed consent prior to the performance of any protocol-specified
             procedure; or if unable to provide informed consent due to cognitive status, full
             written informed consent on behalf of the subject has been provided by a legally
             acceptable representative[1].[1] Where this is in accordance with local laws,
             regulations and ethics committee policy.

          -  Caregiver has provided full written informed consent on his or her own behalf prior
             to the performance of any protocol-specified procedure.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Subject had a serious adverse experience (SAE) or clinically significant laboratory
             abnormality during 49653/461, which in the opinion of the investigator could have
             been attributable to study medication, and which is ongoing at the end of 49653/461.

          -  The subject is felt by the investigator to be unsuitable (on the basis of health,
             compliance, caregiver availability, or for any other reason) for inclusion in the
             study based on the entry criteria for the primary study, 49653/461 (exclusive of the
             age criteria which may not be applicable to some of the subjects).

          -  The subject experienced a significant cardiovascular event during 49653/461 (e.g.
             intervention, percutaneous coronary intervention, vascular surgery, acute coronary
             syndrome [non Q-wave myocardial infarction, Q-wave myocardial infarction, unstable
             angina] or significant arrhythmia), unless a thorough cardiovascular evaluation has
             been performed which confirms that the subject does not have congestive heart
             failure, and is clinically stable.

          -  Treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor, selegiline, memantine or any other
             treatment for cognitive symptoms/AD is initiated at the end of 49653/461.
