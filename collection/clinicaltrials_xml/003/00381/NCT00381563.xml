  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis, sometimes called degenerative joint disease, is the most common form of
      arthritis. It occurs when the cartilage in joints wears down over time. Symptoms can include
      pain, tenderness, stiffness, and inflammation. Studies have suggested that symptoms of knee
      osteoarthritis may be caused by abnormalities at the patellofemoral joint, which is the
      joint between the kneecap, called the patella, and the thigh bone, called the femur. This
      study will determine whether wearing a knee brace that realigns the patella over the femur
      is effective in relieving pain and improving function in adults with knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bending and straightening at the knee causes the patella to glide along a groove in the
      femur bone. However, biomechanical imbalances can cause the patella to jump off track, which
      can lead to pain. Interventions that alter the load distribution across the patellofemoral
      joint, such as patella taping, may be helpful in alleviating symptoms. Patellar taping has
      in fact been shown to be effective in the short-term for treating patellofemoral
      osteoarthritis. But it has not been widely adopted in the clinical setting because it is
      complicated to administer, difficult to educate the patient about ongoing application, and
      lacks evidence of long-term efficacy. Also, patients often experience skin irritation from
      the taping and discomfort when removing the taping. An alternative treatment option is the
      use of a knee brace that realigns the tracking of the patella. This study will determine
      whether wearing a patellofemoral realigning knee brace is effective in relieving pain and
      improving function in adults with knee osteoarthritis.

      Participation in this study will last about 3 to 9 months. All eligible participants will
      wear the same knee brace for a 2-week run-in period during which they will record when they
      wear the brace and any pain medication used. Next, participants will be randomly assigned to
      wear one of two knee braces for 6 weeks and a minimum of 4 hours each day. This will be
      followed by 6 weeks of wearing no knee brace, and then by 6 weeks of wearing whichever knee
      brace they did not wear during the first 6-week period. There will be a total of nine study
      visits. The first study visit will screen for eligible participants and will include an
      interview, knee evaluations, x-rays, and a urine pregnancy test. The second and sixth study
      visits will include knee evaluations, brace fittings, and instructions on how to correctly
      wear and adjust the brace. Most of the other study visits will consist primarily of
      interviews and functional tests. During the first and third 6-week periods, participants
      will maintain a log to record how long they wear their braces and any pain medication used.
      Participants will also wear an accelerometer, which will keep track of how many steps they
      take.

      Participants will have the option of continuing in a 6-month follow-up period during which
      they can wear the brace of their choice. There will be three evaluations that will include
      questions on how participants are doing with their braces.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Knee pain on most days

          -  Either isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis or mixed patellofemoral and
             tibiofemoral osteoarthritis, as based on x-ray

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bed- or chair-bound, usually uses an ambulation aid to walk (e.g., cane, crutch, or
             walker), or uses a wheelchair

          -  Pain emanating more from the back or hip than from the knee, as determined by
             screening questionnaire

          -  Low pain score on the visual analog scale (VAS) (less than 4 out of 10)

          -  Plans to move from the area within 10 months of study screening

          -  Symptomatic comorbid disease that limits activities more than knee pain does, as
             determined by screening questionnaire (e.g., congestive heart failure, chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease)

          -  Receiving corticosteroid injections in the month before study entry, or receiving
             hyaluronan in the 6-month period before study entry. No other treatments will result
             in exclusion, although for patients taking glucosamine and/or chondroitin and/or a
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), they must have taken these treatments
             for at least 2 months before study entry and must commit to not start a new treatment
             during the study.

          -  Bilateral total knee replacements or plans for a total knee replacement of the
             affected knee in the next 6 months

          -  Morbidly obese (body mass index greater than 35), as brace fitting and prevention of
             slippage of the brace will be difficult

          -  Known other causes of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, gout, psoriatic arthritis, and pseudogout

          -  Skin breakdown at the site where the brace will be applied

          -  Failure to pass the run-in test, or the brace falls down the leg during the run-in
