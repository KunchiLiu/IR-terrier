    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well education with or without physical therapy
      intervention works in preventing lymphedema in women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer
      who are undergoing axillary lymph node dissection (surgery to remove lymph nodes found in
      the armpit region). Lymphedema is a condition in which extra lymph fluid builds up in
      tissues and causes swelling in an arm or leg if lymph vessels are blocked, damaged, or
      removed by surgery. A personalized physical therapy intervention and education materials may
      be better than education materials alone in preventing lymphedema in women with breast
      cancer who are undergoing axillary lymph node dissection.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test, in a group randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of this program versus
      education only in reducing the incidence of lymphedema.

      II. To compare the severity of lymphedema, in terms of changes in arm circumference at the
      site of greatest difference as a continuous variable between the two interventions.

      III. To assess the agreement between patients' self-report of swelling (mild, moderate, and
      severe) and the extent of circumferential measurement difference between the treated side
      and the contralateral arm at the site of greatest difference.

      IV. To compare the health-related quality of life (Factional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Breast [FACT-B]+4 score) between the two interventions.

      V. To characterize adherence to lymphedema prevention exercises, lymphedema knowledge, and
      range of motion.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Six weeks after surgery, patients receive a brief initial post-operative care session
      describing lymphedema risk and prevention through oral instruction and written materials.
      Patients complete physical assessments and questionnaires at 6 weeks and at 6, 12, and 18
      months. Patients are also contacted by telephone at 9 and 15 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive lymphedema education and complete physical assessments and
      questionnaires as in Arm I. Patients also complete a personalized physical therapy
      intervention, receive a refrigerator magnet, and a 15-minute video that reinforces
      information and exercises.

             lymphedema sub-study

          -  No documented cardiac conduction disturbances, unstable angina, dementia, or any
             other chronic disease which, in the opinion of the treating physician, significantly

          -  Patients with double mastectomy, axillary node dissection and/or radiation on both
             arms are ineligible; patients who undergo these treatments (i.e., surgery and/or
             radiation) on the contralateral arm after registration to Step 2 are still eligible
             to remain in the study; however, it should be documented appropriately on form C-1628
