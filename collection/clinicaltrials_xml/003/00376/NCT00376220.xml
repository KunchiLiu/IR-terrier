    <textblock>
      The Johns Hopkins Department of Psychiatry is conducting a research study to examine the
      effectiveness of riluzole in treating the depressed phase of bipolar disorder. This
      outpatient treatment study of medication or placebo will last 9-12 weeks. The study includes
      medical and psychiatric evaluations as well as time-limited medication treatment at no cost,
      and you will be compensated for your participation.

      The study will last 8 to 12 weeks and requires weekly visits. Participants will come to
      Johns Hopkins for a screening visit during which they will talk with a psychiatrist, answer
      questions about their mood and symptoms, have their blood drawn and have a brief physical
      exam. If they meet criteria for the study, any antidepressant medication that they are
      taking will be tapered and stopped before beginning study medications. Participation in the
      study includes free study medication, labs, and testing plus reimbursement for
      transportation. Participants will also be paid and after the study referred back to their
      treating psychiatrist with treatment recommendations.

    <description>Initially dispensed 50 mg capsules to take BID. At two weeks, increase dose to 50 mg/100 mg. At four weeks increase to 100 mg BID (two capsules qAM, two capsules qHS). If significant side effects occur (at any time), titration can be slowed and doses can be reduced to a minimum daily dose of 50 mg/day, after which titration may resume by no more than 50 mg a week. Subjects who are unable to tolerate the minimal daily dose permitted in the study will be discontinued from further participation. In addition, if clinical remission is observed at a lower dose of study medication (defined as MADRS &lt; 12) the dose will not be increased further unless clinical symptoms recur.</description>
