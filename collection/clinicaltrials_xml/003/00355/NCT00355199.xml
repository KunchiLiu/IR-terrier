      Multicentric randomized phase III study comparing high doses of chemotherapy with Rituximab
      followed by auto-transplant HPC versus CHOP plus Rituximab as first line therapy in high
      risk patients with DLBCL Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B cells Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas represents one of the most frequent form of
      lymphoma. Its clinical development progresses rapidly and is characterized by a biphasic
      survival curve with patients in complete remission (which can be considered cured) and
      patients that relapse. This last group of subjects have only 25%-33% chance of long free
      disease survival if treated with a second line therapy with high dose chemotherapy plus
      autologous transplant of PBPC.

      Therefore in order to achieve an improvement of the overall survival in patient with DLBCL,
      it is necessary to increase the number of complete remission after first line therapy.

      The aim of R-HDS study, multicentre randomized phase III trial, is to evaluate and compare
      the efficacy and safety of an intensive conditioning regimen with high intensity
      chemo-immunotherapy (R-HDS) plus autologous transplantation versus CHOP conditioning regimen
      plus Rituximab in patients with unfavorable prognosis at diagnosis.
