    <textblock>
      This study is an exploratory study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of
      three concentrations of GW786034 ointment following treatment to small areas of stable
      psoriatic plaques. Dosing will proceed using a microplaque approach, where small volumes of
      ointment will be applied under full occlusion to representative psoriatic plaques. The
      effectiveness of topical GW786034 treatments and controls will be explored using visual
      intensity assessments in addition to dermal imaging and histological surrogates of disease
      activity.

             as deemed by the dermatologist: Moderate to severe in elevation (thickness),
             erythema, and scaling (with a total score of at least 6 for each target lesion, when
             assessed using a 0-4 PASI score). Located on the trunk, buttocks, thighs or upper
             arms. Are of a sufficient size that will allow the application of three occlusive
             patches.
