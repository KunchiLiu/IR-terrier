      The objective of this study is to assess the performance of a noninvasive device for the
      early screening of Diabetes Mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 18 million people have Type II diabetes, and of these, an estimated
      thirty-five percent are unaware of their condition. This translates to roughly 6.3 million
      undiagnosed cases worldwide in 2002. Many diagnoses are made years after the onset of the
      disease. This allows progression of the vascular lesions that arise during the time of
      uncontrolled glucose levels. As a result, microvascular retinopathy, nephropathy, and
      neuropathy are on the rise, as well as macrovascular complications such as: coronary heart
      disease, and cerebral vascular accidents. The prevalence and trends of diabetes underscore
      the need for effective and widespread screening. Our fluorescence based system under
      development will noninvasively measure skin glycation end products that are known to be
      strongly correlated with diabetes status and complications. Since the test would be painless
      and require no patient fasting, significant obstacles to screening compliance would be
      mitigated. The system offers hope for a screening test that is more sensitive and specific
      than the invasive tests currently used for diabetes screening (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test
      (OGTT) and the Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) test).
