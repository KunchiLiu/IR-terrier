      The purpose of this study is determine the safety of 5-fluorouracil, bevacizumab and
      erlotinib when administered in combination with external beam radiation therapy(Phase I
      portion) as well as to begin to collect information about whether this combination treatment
      is effective in treating(Phase II portion) patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

      -  All participants will receive the following drugs: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) given as a
           continuous 24-hour infusion; Bevacizumab given intravenously; erlotinib given orally at
           home. In the Phase I portion, we are looking for the highest dose of erlotinib that can
           be given safely in combination with the 5-FU, bevacizumab and radiation therapy.
           Therefore the dose of erlotinib may not be the same for each participant. The dose will
           increase until we find the highest dose without causing serious or unmanageable side
           effects.

        -  Study treatment is given as an outpatient and consists of 14 day cycles with a total of
           3 cycles. Patients will be given all three study drugs and radiation therapy on a
           monday (unless a monday falls on on a holiday). This will be day 1 of the first
           treatment cycle. 5-FU is given continuously days 1-14. Bevacizumab is given on day 1.
           Erlotinib will be given on days 1-14. Radiation therapy will be performed on Days 1-5
           and 8-12.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed weekly while participants are
           receiving study treatment: physical examination, measurement of vital signs, height and
           weight; performance status; blood work, urine sample.

        -  At the end of treatment the following tests will be performed: physical examination and
           measurement of vital signs; performance status; blood work; CT scans of chest, abdomen
           and pelvis. Patients will also be evaluated for surgery at this time. Patients will be
           followed every three months for the first three years after surgery, then every 6
           months for the next two years.
