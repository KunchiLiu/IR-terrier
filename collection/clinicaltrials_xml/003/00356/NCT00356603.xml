      This study will be conducted to collect cases treated by self-injection of sumatriptan 3mg
      kit product for the treatment of migraine or cluster headache attacks in clinical settings,
      to demonstrate the efficacy, and to examine patient acceptability (simplicity and
      usefulness) and rate of successful self-injection.
