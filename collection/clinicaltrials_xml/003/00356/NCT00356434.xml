  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers at Johns Hopkins University believe that the foot pump will be superior to
      sequential compression devices in comfort and patient compliance which may increase provider
      efforts to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in pregnancy.

      We will be comparing sequential compression devices (SCDs) to foot pumps to determine if
      foot pumps will be better tolerated by obstetric patients, both antepartum and intrapartum.
      Patients in whom thromboembolic prophylaxis is deemed necessary and ordered by the treating
      physician, who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to receive SCDs
      or the foot pump as part of their thromboembolic prophylaxis regimen. We will administer a
      questionnaire to assess patients' satisfaction and comfort with each device and they will be
      asked to complete a log of hours they wore their assigned device for a 7 day period (or as
      long as they are prescribed). Random spot checks to verify compliance will be performed.
