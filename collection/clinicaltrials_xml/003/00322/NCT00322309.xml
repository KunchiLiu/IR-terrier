      This research study is being done to to look at the safety of the medication Mirtazapine
      (Remeron) in people who have cocaine dependence and depression. Hypotheses I. Cocaine usage
      will be less in the mirtazapine treatment group (MG) than in the control group (CG). II. A
      greater increase in Clinician Global Impression (CGI) score will be observed in the MG than
      in the CG. Secondary Hypotheses: I. A greater decrease in Hamilton Rating Scale for
      Depression (HAM-D) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) scores will be observed in
      the MG than in the CG. II. A greater decrease in HIV risk behaviors will be observed in the
      MG than in the CG. III. A greater improvement in sleep structure will be observed in the MG
      than in the CG. IV. The proportion of subjects experiencing severe adverse drug reactions
      that necessitate termination from the study by one of the study clinicians will not differ
      between the MG and CG. V. Retention will be greater in MG than in CG.

      Cocaine dependence is a significant public health problem associated with serious medical,
      psychiatric, social and economic consequences. It is generally accepted that the euphoria
      associated with cocaine use is a result of its action on reward pathways via antagonist
      properties at the dopamine transporter site; cocaine also inhibits reuptake of serotonin and
      norepinephrine. These actions are thought to underlie cocaine's potent reinforcing
      properties. With prolonged use, cocaine may deplete these neurotransmitters, affect
      postsynaptic receptor density, and elicit an overall dysregulation of these neurotransmitter
      systems. These longer term consequences may account for the post-cocaine depressive symptoms
      often claimed by cocaine users to contribute to relapse. Treatment for cocaine dependence at
      the present is primarily psychosocial/behavioral. Currently there is no pharmacological
      agent approved for treatment of cocaine dependence in conjunction with psychosocial
      interventions. Several drugs currently approved for other indications are presently under
      consideration for treatment of cocaine dependence based on their known mechanisms and sites
      of action. Current approaches include strategies to (1) block the effects of cocaine, (2)
      substitutes for cocaine, (3) reduce craving or enhance the addict's ability to manage
      his/her response to craving, and (4) treat underlying conditions (or consequences of cocaine
      use) that may predispose toward dependence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis
             of cocaine dependence.

          -  HAM-D score of 12 or above and history of autonomous depression, defined as meeting
             DSM-IV criteria for major depression or dysthymic disorder during any lifetime period
             of abstinence of 30 days or longer.

          -  At least one urine toxicology positive for cocaine BE over the consecutive two-week
             baseline screening period during which 6 urine samples have been obtained
