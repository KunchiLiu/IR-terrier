  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study Hypothesis: Pioglitazone may decrease inflammation in cystic fibrosis lung disease.

      Markers of inflammation (neutrophils, elastase, cytokines and bacteria)will be measured in
      induced sputum specimens before and after a 4 week treatment period with pioglitazone in
      clinically stable CF patients.
