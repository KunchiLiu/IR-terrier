  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tested the safety of a new malaria vaccine in adults in Mali, West Africa, and
      measured the ability of the vaccine to stimulate antibodies directed against the malaria
      protein that the vaccine is based on. Forty adults were randomly assigned to get either the
      experimental malaria vaccine or a rabies vaccine, for comparison.

    <textblock>
      The study was a randomized, controlled trial in which participants and clinical
      investigators were blinded to vaccine group assignment. Forty adults were randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive either FMP1/AS02A or the control rabies vaccine. The aims of the
      control group were to account for baseline morbidity and the impact of seasonal malaria
      transmission on the dynamics of anti-MSP-1 antibodies, and to minimize bias in assessment of
      adverse events. Vaccines were given on a 0-, 1- and 2-month schedule. The first immunization
      was given in early July just as malaria transmission began; the second dose at the end of
      July as transmission was increasing; and the third dose in late August near the peak of
      malaria transmission intensity. Study day 90 was in October, shortly after transmission
      crests and when severe and uncomplicated malaria disease episodes peak, study day 180 was at
      the end of the malaria season, and study day 272 was at the height of the dry season. The
      final study follow-up on day 364 coincided with the beginning of the 2004 malaria season.
      Interim safety analyses were reviewed by an independent Safety Monitoring Committee before
      the second and third immunizations.

          -  Written informed screening and study consent obtained from the participant before
             study start.

          -  Available and willing to participate in follow-up for the duration of study (12
             months)

        Exclusion Criteria:

             vaccine.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study

             up to 30 days after the third dose.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immuno-suppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. This will
             include oral steroids and inhaled steroids, but not topical steroids.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             within 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine(s) with the exception of

          -  History of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to immunizations or to any vaccine
             component.
