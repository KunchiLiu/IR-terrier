  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how children and adolescents with Attention
      Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) respond to treatment with three differing doses of
      stimulant medications used to treat ADHD, Adderall XR® and Focalin XR®. Another purpose of
      the study is to evaluate if there are differences in sleep and other side effects, such as
      changes in mood or loss of appetite, which can occur with stimulant medications. A third
      purpose is to determine if there are differences in the characteristics of individuals who
      respond better to either of the medications.

      This research is being done because the investigators do not know if one of these two
      commonly used treatments is better tolerated than the other. Children and adolescents with
      ADHD often have a hard time sitting still, playing quietly, finishing things they start,
      paying attention, waiting their turn, and not distracting others. These medications improve
      these symptoms, but sometimes affect sleep, appetite, or mood.

      It is hypothesized that at effective and frequently prescribed doses, Adderall will be
      associated with insomnia, more stimulant side effects, and decreased tolerability during an
      acute trial relative to Focalin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD is often treated with stimulant medications, which have demonstrated short-term
      efficacy in numerous trials. However, treatment is often discontinued prematurely. Although
      ADHD often persists through adolescence, approximately half of all children who are treated
      with a stimulant medication discontinue treatment within one year (Charach, Ickowicz et al.
      2004). Presumably, tolerability and treatment compliance are highly related to the side
      effect profile of stimulant medications (Schachar, Jadad et al. 2002). Sleep problems,
      particularly insomnia, are frequently associated with ADHD and are often exacerbated by
      stimulant medications, particularly at higher doses. Other frequent stimulant side effects
      are decreased appetite and mood lability (dysphoria/euphoria). Little is known about the
      relative effects of different stimulant formulations and dosages (i.e amphetamine,
      methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate) on sleep and tolerability. There is some preliminary
      data with short acting stimulants suggesting a higher prevalence of sleep and appetite
      problems with amphetamine relative to mph (Pelham, Aronoff et al. 1999). Several studies
      indicate that sleep and other stimulant side effects are dose related (Stein, Sarampote et
      al. 2003), although this has not been found in all studies. Moreover, it is unclear if there
      are differences between long-acting amphetamine and methylphenidate based stimulants in
      their side effect profile and tolerability. Thus, we will directly compare these two long
      acting stimulant medications on their side effect profile and tolerability, including
      measures of sleep, mood, and evening behavior (e.g., family conflicts). The recently
      developed extended release formulation of dexmethylphenidate will be compared to one of the
      most common treatments for ADHD, extended release formulation of mixed amphetamine salts.
      The subject population will be older children and adolescents (10-17) with ADHD who are most
      likely to be treated with moderate to higher dose levels of stimulant medications and can
      complete all self-report measures.
