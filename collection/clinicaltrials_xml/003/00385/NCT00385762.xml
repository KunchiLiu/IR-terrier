  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Institute of Mental Health, depressive disorders afflict over six
      million U.S. men annually. Most cases of moderate or severe depression are treated with
      antidepressants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and,
      more recently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and antidepressants with
      modest serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition but unknown mechanism-of-action.
      Over the past two years, prescribing data show a steady increase in antidepressant
      dispensing rates (especially including serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for adults. SSRIs are
      known to have an effect on ejaculatory function and are therapeutically used for treatment
      of premature (rapid) ejaculation. However, few studies have evaluated the potential impact
      of antidepressant medications on male fertility, and no studies have been published with
      respect to the impact of newer antidepressants, such as SSRIs, on male fertility. In the
      high-volume male infertility practice at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, several
      patients have presented who have had a clear temporal association between SSRI use and
      impairment in sperm motility and/or sperm transport (emission). These men have shown
      improvement in sperm counts and motility after discontinuation of antidepressant
      medications.

      We propose a crossover pilot study of normal healthy males to ascertain possible effects of
      SSRIs on semen parameters. After initial screening semen analyses, subjects will take the
      SSRI paroxetine for five weeks. Serial semen analyses will be obtained while on medication
      and one month after discontinuation of medication. Comparisons between semen parameters on
      and off medication will be used to evaluate the frequency and significance of semen analysis
      changes during SSRI treatment.
