      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the administration of
      Risperidal-Consta on the brain's reward circuitry using MRI, behavioral tests and measuring
      cocaine craving and use among people with active cocaine dependence.

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Potential participants must be able to identify at least one &quot;locator&quot; person to
