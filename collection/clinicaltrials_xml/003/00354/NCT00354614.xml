      The primary endpoints for this study are that the AL validation will 1) achieve a
      sensitivity of greater than 80% for AHI values greater than or equal to 15, and 2)
      demonstrate a correlation coefficient of r=0.75 indicating strong correlation between the
      AHI of diagnostic PSG and AL.

      All subjects with suspected Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) scheduled for diagnostic
      polysomnography (PSG) will be invited to participate in the study to be tested to determine
      if they have Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), using the ApneaLink (AL) Sleep Screener.
      Subjects initially will be tested for SDB in the home environment. Following an AL home
      test, subjects will undergo a simultaneous, attended diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) sleep
      study and ApneaLink test for the purpose of confirming and comparing the results between
      diagnostic PSG and the AL device.
