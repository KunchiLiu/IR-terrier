  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis (also called painful bladder syndrome, or chronic pelvic pain
      syndrome) is a common condition with no known cure. Twin studies and family accounts have
      suggested that the condition may be genetic and passed down (or inherited) from one
      generation to the next.

      In this study, we are collecting genetic material and medical information from families in
      North America in an attempt to identify genetic factors that may cause Interstitial
      Cystitis. We are enrolling families and individuals with IC/PBS/CPPS and their family
      members (both family members with and without IC like symptoms).

      To fully describe the phenotype of interstitial cystitis (IC)/painful bladder syndrome
      (PBS)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), in adults and children, and to correlate the
      phenotypic information to the genotypic findings utilizing linkage analysis and candidate
      gene studies. A North American cohort and a Bulgarian cohort will be recruited. Both
      individuals and families with IC/PBS/CPPS symptoms will be recruited to give a DNA (from
      saliva) and urine sample.
