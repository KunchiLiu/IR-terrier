        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is receiving or has received treatment prior to randomization which might
             influence bone turnover

             postmenopausal bone loss)

          -  Patient is receiving or is expected to receive during the course of the study any
             medication (other than study medication) which might alter bone or calcium metabolism
