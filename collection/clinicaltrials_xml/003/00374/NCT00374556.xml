      This research is being done to evaluate the effects of a sleeping pill (eszopiclone,
      Lunesta)in patients with arthritis of the knee who also suffer from chronic insomnia. This
      study will test whether Lunesta improves sleep, pain sensitivity, and daytime symptoms in
      patients with knee pain.
