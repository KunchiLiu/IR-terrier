  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether or not marijuana blunts will produce
      comparable plasma THC levels as marijuana joints and if blunts will produce larger
      cardiovascular and subjective effects.

      There has been a rapid increase in marijuana use during the 1990s, with the most recent
      generation often smoking marijuana in the form of 'blunts' as opposed to more traditional
      routes such as in pipes or in cigarette paper. A blunt is made by removing the tobacco from
      a cigar and replacing it with marijuana (Golub and Johnson, 1999). The cigar wrapper
      contains tobacco and nicotine, which may interact with the cardiovascular and subjective
      effects of the marijuana to produce a different set of effects and risks than cigarette
      paper. Anecdotally, marijuana smokers report that blunts are more potent than joints, yet
      there have been no controlled studies addressing whether blunts enhance the
      subjective-effects and health-related consequences of marijuana use. We are proposing to do
      a within-subject, placebo-controlled study directly comparing the cardiovascular, subjective
      and pharmacokinetic effects of marijuana smoked in blunts compared to identical quantities
      of marijuana smoked in cigarette paper. Research volunteers will be current blunt smokers.
      Each will participate in six, 4-hour outpatient sessions. After baseline data have been
      collected (heart rate, blood pressure, mood scales, exhaled carbon monoxide, plasma THC and
      nicotine levels), participants will take 3 puffs, 5 seconds in duration, from a NIDA
      marijuana cigarette containing 0.0, 1.8 and 3.6% THC or from a blunt containing an
      equivalent quantity and strength of marijuana. Participants will be blind to the type of
      marijuana cigarette smoked. We will measure plasma THC and nicotine, subjective mood
      ratings, and heart rate and blood pressure repeatedly over the course of 180 minutes
      following smoking. This study is the first controlled investigation of the consequences of
      this new method of marijuana smoking; the data obtained may be useful in guiding future
      development of marijuana pharmacotherapy.
