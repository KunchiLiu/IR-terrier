      This project is a VA HSR&amp;D-funded Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) project to
      translate into practice evidence about clinical management of primary hypertension. The
      project aims to contribute to quality improvement of care for patients with primary
      hypertension. The project will implement a clinical decision support system for primary care
      clinicians and will evaluate the implementation by studying the impact on the clinicians'
      prescribing and their patients' blood pressures, and will also study organizational factors.

      Background / Rationale:

      Despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines, there is a gap between evidence-based
      recommended best medical practice and actual practice. In previous work, we have used
      hypertension as a model to study the translation of research clinical targets and drug
      choice into primary care practice through computer-based implementation of clinical practice
      guidelines. In collaboration with experts in guideline-automation at Stanford Center for
      Biomedical Informatics Research (BMIR), we developed an innovative clinical decision support
      system: ATHENA-HTN (hypertension). We have demonstrated that deploying this sophisticated
      system in VA primary care clinics is feasible and clinicians find the system usable and
      useful, as shown by their actual extensive use of the system and their response to
      questionnaire survey. We have also found that the system improved clinician prescribing.

      Objective(s):

      Our objectives in this QUERI-funded VISN Implementation Collaborative include: (1) implement
      evidence-based guidelines for hypertension by upgrading the ATHENA knowledge-base (KB) to
      the most recent guidelines; (2) deploy the system in 5 medical centers within VISN 1 to
      generate individualized recommendations to primary care clinicians caring for patients in
      outpatient clinics; (3) evaluate the implementation.

      Methods:

      In Phase 1 we planned to update the KB and conduct offline testing; to revise the M program
      that extracts patient data daily from VistA to extract additional data elements; to
      streamline the system architecture to make it easier to implement in multiple sites; to work
      with the site-PIs to obtain IRB approval at 5 implementation sites in VISN 1 plus the
      coordinating site at VA Palo Alto; to improve the user interface design; to identify and
      resolve issues in implementing new information technology in multiple different VAMCs with
      different CPRS implementations; to train the site PIs in use of the system; and perform
      baseline data analysis to inform the randomization. In Phase 2 we plan to recruit primary
      care providers from the participating 5 medical centers in VISN 1; randomize clinics to
      ATHENA-HTN intervention or usual care; deploy the system for intervention providers; train
      intervention providers in use of the system; and conduct a 12-month clinical trial of the
      system. In Phase 3 we plan to analyze the results of the clinical trial.

      Status:

      As of November 2010, we are in Phase 3 of the project. We have completed IRB approvals at
      all five medical centers. We have updated the knowledgebase and have conducted offline
      testing. Our system has been deployed to all five medical centers. We've developed new code
      to run the system in a thin client environment. We've also developed HTML for a new
      graphical interface, automatic blood pressure update for the day of visit, and code for
      blood pressure write back to VistA. Due to difficulties appointing programmer staff we had
      to defer plans to program the new user interface (that is now being done in a separate
      project for future use). Our site principal investigators and project coordinator trained
      intervention providers at the five medical centers on the use of the system. One medical
      center completed the use of the ATHENA-HTN system for the training period but did not
      continue with the intervention period. VA Palo Alto staff worked with staff at each VAMC to
      validate ATHENA-HTN data at each site. We completed a 6-8 month intervention period for the
      clinical trial at four of the five medical centers. 103 primary care providers from the five
      medical centers participated in the trial during the active intervention period at their
      sites. Our random allocation is at clinic (substation) level. As of May 2011, we have closed
      the IRB at all 5 medical centers in VISN 1 New England; we are conducting data analyses at
      VA Palo Alto only. We have completed validating the extracted data, and have computed
      variables and established subset datasets for specific analyses. We are conducting our
      primary outcome analyses for whether or not pharmacotherapy for hypertension was
      intensified. We will also be conducing secondary outcome analyses, as time permits, per
      detailed written data analysis plan.

      Impact:

      Our VISN Collaborative study will provide insight into how to upgrade automated guidelines
      (an important issue in light of rapid changes in clinical knowledge and guidelines) and how
      to integrate the system with the VA electronic medical record across multiple VAMCs. We will
      learn about barriers and facilitators for clinician guideline adherence, and the impact of
      this quality improvement strategy on clinician prescribing and patient blood pressures, to
      learn how clinical decision support systems can best be implemented to assist clinicians in
      providing evidence-based care for patients

    <description>The primary outcome is intensification of therapy for hypertension when the patient's blood pressure is above target. Alternate events that we plan to track include: achieving target BP prior to intensification of therapy; return visits with continued blood pressure above target or blood pressure not measured and no intensification of therapy (undesired outcome). The enrollment number 103 is the number of primary careproviders who started the intervention phase of the trial at their study site.</description>
