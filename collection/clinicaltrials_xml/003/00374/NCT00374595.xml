      Hypothesis: Nontraditional risk factors, such as inflammation, vitamin D deficiency,
      elevated PTH, insulin resistance, homocysteine, or uric acid, contribute to cardiovascular
      disease progression after kidney transplant.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate which traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular
      disease risk factors best predict progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using carotid
      intima media thickness performed by ultrasound, in kidney transplant patients.

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease remains the greatest cause of mortality after kidney transplant.
      Traditional risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and smoking,
      contribute to vascular disease after transplant, but nontraditional risk factors may play a
      bigger role in vascular disease progression in this setting. This observational study will
      evaluate nontraditional risk factors for their contributions to vascular disease progression
      as determined by carotid intima media thickness and history of vascular disease events over
      time. The study requires annual checks of blood, urine, history, and carotid ultrasound for
      carotid intima media thickness
