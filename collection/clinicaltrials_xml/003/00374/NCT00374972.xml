      Objective: To determine and compare the effect of low dose estrogen combined hormonal
      contraceptives and progestin-only contraceptives on lactation.

      The subjects will be drawn from a healthy obstetric population in each center, where
      possible preliminary contact during antenatal period. At the postpartum visit, subjects that
      express their wish for a hormonal contraceptive method will be offered enrollment. After
      obtaining an informed consent the participants will be allocated according to their free
      wish to either receive a combined preparation containing 0.02 mg ethylestradiol and 0.15 mg
      desogestrel (Mercilon, Organon) or a progestin only pill containing 0.075 mg desogestrel
      (Cerazette, Organon). Demographic, habits and perinatal data will be collected and stored to
      analysis.

      Frequency and methods of observation: All women will be followed at 6 (baseline), 9 and 12
      weeks post â€“ partum. Instruction will be given as to recording information on intercurrent
      disease, frequency of nursing and use of complementary formula supplements. Maternal BMI
      calculation ( weight/height2) will be obtained at first visit.

      The objective is to compare the capacity of the breast to secrete milk under standard
      conditions and evaluate the influence of different hormonal contraception means. Thus
      samples will be collected at 6 weeks (enrollment) and the 9 and 12 weeks visits. An Egnell
      pump will be used for a maximum of 20 minutes form from both breasts, simulating a regular
      breast feeding. A total of 10 ml aliquot will be taken for composition analysis and the rest
      will be offered to the infant. The milk volume/feeding will be estimated and expressed in
      ml/feeding and multiplied by the number of feedings reported.

      Outcome variables: Milk volume, infant growth at each visit and biochemical markers of milk
      analysis : lipid, casein and carbohydrate content
