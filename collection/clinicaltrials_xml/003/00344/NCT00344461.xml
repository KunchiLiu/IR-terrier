      Open label, two year study of the clinical efficacy of the combination of FTC, Tenofovir,
      and Nevirapine. Sixty HIV infected patients without previous exposure to antiretroviral
      therapy will be enrolled. Study will include a pharmacokinetic substudy to evaluate the
      interaction of FTC and Nevirapine. Truvada may be used.

      Description of study design This is an open-labeled clinical trial evaluating an
      antiretroviral treatment regimen in which the drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity in
      both, resting and activated mononuclear cells. These drugs include: FTC 200 mg p.o. qd, and
      Tenofovir 300 mg p.o. qd, and Nevirapine 200 mg b.i.d.

      Eligible patients must be at least 18 years of age, be referred by their primary HIV
      provider for antiretroviral therapy or if the patient is self referred, have a CD4 cell
      count of &lt; 250/mm3 and have a viral load &gt;5,000c/ml. Eligibility requirement for women is
      that they must have a CD4 cell count of &lt;250 at the time of enrollment. This cutoff for
      women is based on unpublished data that there may be increased hepatotoxicity in women with
      a CD4 cell count &gt; 250 cell/mm3. The screening evaluation will take place the day the
      informed consent is signed. During that screening evaluation, the patient will undergo a
      history and physical examination, and will have study labs drawn. Within 60 days of the
      screening evaluation and meeting all eligible criteria, the patient will be placed on the
      study treatment regimen. Patients will be evaluated at the clinic on Day 0 (therapy
      initiation), weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and then every 8 weeks until 48 weeks and thereafter
      every 12 weeks through week 96. At the end of the study, all patients may continue their
      current antiretroviral treatment regimen at the discretion of the patient and their primary
      care provider.

      Pharmacokinetic Analysis Sub Study A pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed in first 7
      volunteers to assess the impact of FTC on Nevirapine and vice versa. Pharmacokinetic
      analysis will be performed at end of week 2 ( day 14) during 200mg qd start up period.
      Samples will be obtained at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours post Nevirapine dosing.
      Pharmacokinetic analysis will be repeated at the week 8 visit. Samples will be obtained at
      baseline and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours post Nevirapine.

      Assignment of patients There will be 60 patients involved in this clinical trial. This is an
      open-labeled study. There are no placebos involved in this study.

      Dose and dose selection The dosages of medications are those that are currently used as
      standard clinical practice: Nevirapine 200 mg b.i.d. (1-200 mg tablet b.i.d.); Emtricitabine
      (FTC) 200mg po qd.(1-200mg capsule); Tenofovir 300 mg once-a-day (1-300 mg tablet qd).

      Justification of study design All study patients require treatment for their HIV infection.
      All of the drugs used in this study are FDA-Approved. Tenofovir and FTC are approved as a
      once-a-day treatment medication. Nevirapine (NVP) is approved for BID dosing.

      NOTE: That whenever Nevirapine is being prescribed, there will be a lead-in period of 14
      days in which Nevirapine will be prescribed as 200 mg once a day followed by 200 mg BID as
      is the recommended standard of care.
