  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to characterize genes associated either with susceptibility
      or resistance to the development nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in a Chinese population
      where the incidence of NPC is as high as 50 in 100,000. NPC has been and remains a unique
      model of human malignancy for understanding a multi-step carcinogenic process involving a
      ubiquitous virus (Epstein-Barr virus), environmental carcinogens, and an NPC susceptibility
      gene. Up to 95% of all NPC patients at early or late stage of the disease have IgA
      antibodies directed to the EBV virus VCA (viral capsid antigen). Environmental factors have
      also been implicated as significant risk factors in the development of NPC. In addition,
      certain alleles in HLA genes have shown associations with NPC, perhaps in concert with a
      family of T-cell receptor genes (TCR). Other data suggest that a microsatellite marker on
      Chromosome 6 may be associated with an NPC-disease associated gene.

      The objective of this study is to characterize genes associated either with susceptibility

      Chromosome 6 may be associated with an NPC-disease associated gene.

      We will use a &quot;triad&quot; approach to attempt to dissociate genetic from environmental and viral
      associations of NPC incidence. Blood samples will be collected from volunteers (probands)
      and family members (spouse and child and/or parent of patient) at two sites in Guangxi
      Province, China: the Cancer Research and Control Institute in Wuzhou City; and the Cang Wu
      County Cancer Hospital, located about 20 miles from Wuzhou. All cases will be EBV/IgA/VCA
      positive. These triad of samples will provide both control and haplotypic information on
      cases and controls. A database of pertinent clinical and family information will be created
      from a questionnaire filled in by hospital staff interviewers. Blood will be separated into
      plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Plasma will be tested at the Wuzhou
      Center for EBV/IgA/VCA. The PBMCs will be viably frozen and transported to the LGD at
      NCI/FCRDC, where they will be transformed into lymphoblastoid cell lines for extraction of
      DNA. At the LGD the DNAs will be screened for informative polymorphisms in candidate genes
      by DNA genotyping methods. Association analyses will be performed to detect linkages between
      informative polymorphisms in candidate genes by DNA genotyping methods. Association analyses
      will be performed to detect linkages between informative polymorphisms and clinical and
      family data. If a marker associated with development of NC is found, there are potential
      applications in diagnostics and therapy. Further, identification of allelic polymorphisms in
      genes with a role in NPC progression would offer definitive ties of such genes to the
      carcinogenic process.

      Following this study, the samples will be maintained in our repository and curated through
      our central Laboratory database. Loss or destruction of these samples wil be recorded in our
      database and cannot impact the study participants in any way. We understand that studies
      subsequent to the completion of this protocol will require additional OHSR/IRB approval
      prior to commencement.
