  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the safety and tolerance of single, oral doses of AT-1001 in celiac disease
      subjects that are gluten-free diets and in remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One (1) cohort of 24 (2:1 drug:placebo) subjects will receive single oral doses of either
      AT-1001 or matching placebo. Subjects will complete screening and thereafter be admitted to
      the clinic prior to treatment. On Day 1 AT-1001 or matching placebo will be administered
      followed by a baseline intestinal permeability test. Intestinal permeability will be
      measured by administration of an oral sucrose, lactulose and mannitol solution followed by
      an 8-hour urine collection. Day 2 subjects will be given AT-1001 or matching placebo
      followed by a gluten challenge and have the intestinal permeability test repeated. Day 3
      subjects will be administered AT-1001 or matching placebo followed by a post gluten
      challenge intestinal permeability test. Serial blood samples will be collected for
      pharmacokinetic determinations at baseline, 2, and 3 hours post administration of AT-1001 or
      matching placebo, for zonulin determinations at baseline (prior to first dose) and at 3
      hours post dose, and for cytokine determination at baseline, 3 hours post dose (Days 2 and 3
      only) and Day 7. Sucrose, lactulose, mannitol, zonulin and AT-1001 concentrations will be
      determined by validated analytical methods.

      Subjects will be evaluated at screening (medical history, physical examination, vital signs,
      clinical laboratory testing, and 12-lead electrocardiogram). Vital signs and clinical
      laboratory testing will be conducted pre-dose and vital signs, clinical laboratory testing
      and EKG will be monitored post dose. Adverse event reports will be monitored throughout the
      study. At the end of the study a physical exam and clinical laboratory testing will be
      performed.

          -  Subject intermittently consumes clinically significant quantities of non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory agents (“NSAIDs”) and proton-pump inhibitors, within the last 3
             days prior to the treatment visit.
