      Subjects will complete screening and thereafter be admitted to the clinic prior to
      treatment. Three (3) cohorts of 8 (3:1 ratio drug to placebo) subjects will receive 250 Âµg,
      1 mg, or 4 mg of AT-1001 or matching placebo three times a day for 10 days. The subjects
      will be evaluated for safety at screening, prior to administration of treatment, and
      following dosing of the study drug. Serial blood samples will be collected for
      pharmacokinetic determinations at baseline and 2 hours post morning dose on Days 1, 2, 5, 6
      and 10. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature and monitoring for adverse events will occur
      prior to the morning dose on all other study days. An end of study visit will occur 7-10
      days after last dose.

      Subjects will be evaluated at screening (medical history, physical examination, vital signs,
      clinical laboratory testing, and 12-lead electrocardiograms). A physical exam, vital signs,
      clinical laboratory testing and an EKG will be conducted pre first dose. Vital signs,
      clinical laboratory testing and EKGs will be monitored post dose. Adverse event reports will
      be monitored throughout the study. At the end of the study a physical exam, clinical
      laboratory testing and an EKG will be performed.
