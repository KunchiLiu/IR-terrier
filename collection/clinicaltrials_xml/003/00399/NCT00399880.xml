    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Most people
      who die from CHD die of a heart attack. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a term that
      includes mild heart attacks, as well as other episodes of chest pain that may serve as a
      warning sign for an upcoming heart attack.

      There are many medicines that can help prevent and treat ACS. However, at least 25% of
      patients don't take their medications as prescribed. When patients don't take their
      medications, we say they are noncompliant or nonadherent with the treatment.

      The period following hospital discharge is a vulnerable time for many patients. Patients are
      often confused about what to do when they return home from the hospital. Many patients don't
      take their medications correctly, or they don't take them at all. Patients with poor
      literacy skills have more trouble than others, because it is harder for them to follow
      written instructions. Overall, about half of the adults in the U.S. have poor literacy
      skills. It is important to develop ways to help these adults manage their health better.

      The purposes of this research project are 1) to learn more about the relationship between
      low literacy and medication adherence after hospital discharge, and 2) to test a strategy
      designed to help patients take their medicines more regularly. We will recruit consenting
      patients hospitalized with ACS. We will measure their literacy skills, ask questions about
      how they take their medicines, and measure other related factors like social support and
      self-efficacy. Patients will then be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. One group will receive only
      usual care at hospital discharge, which usually includes the nurse and physician briefly
      reviewing the medication prescriptions. The other group will receive an illustrated daily
      medication schedule and special, tailored counseling from a pharmacist at their time of
      discharge. About 1 week after patients leave the hospital we will contact them by phone to
      ask them questions about how they have been taking their medicines. We will get data from
      patients records for 6 months to see if the intervention had an impact on their medication
      compliance, blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes measurements.

      If this study is successful, this simple strategy could be implemented by hospitals to
      improve medication compliance after discharge. This study will also provide more information
      about how patients' literacy skills affect their medication compliance.
