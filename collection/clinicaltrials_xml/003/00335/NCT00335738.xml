    <textblock>
      This phase III trial is studying vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide to see how well
      they work compared to observation only in treating patients who have undergone surgery for
      newly diagnosed retinoblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine,
      carboplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug
      (combination chemotherapy) after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.
      Sometimes, after surgery, no additional treatment is needed for the tumor until it
      progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Prospectively determine the prevalence of high-risk histopathologic features, such as
      choroidal involvement, optic nerve invasion, and scleral and anterior segment involvement,
      in patients with newly diagnosed unilateral retinoblastoma who have undergone enucleation.

      II. Demonstrate that patients without certain high-risk features can be successfully treated
      with enucleation alone by estimating the event-free survival (EFS) (where an event is
      defined as the occurrence of extraocular or metastatic disease) and overall survival (OS).

      III. Estimate the EFS and OS of patients with specific high-risk features who are uniformly
      treated with adjuvant chemotherapy comprising vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide.

      IV. Estimate the incidence of toxicities associated with the proposed adjuvant chemotherapy
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1
      of 2 groups according to presence of high-risk histopathologic features.

      GROUP 1 (high-risk features): Patients receive vincristine IV and carboplatin IV over 1 hour
      on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP 2 (no high-risk features): Patients undergo observation periodically for at least 5
      years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients in group 1 are followed periodically for at
      least 5 years.
