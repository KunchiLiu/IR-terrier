  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of severe long-term
      disability with serious physical and psychosocial effects. Each year about 700,000 people
      experience a new or recurrent stroke out of which 88% are ischemic. Atherosclerotic carotid
      artery disease is a major contributor to the incidence of stroke, particularly in the
      elderly. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is believed to reduce the risk of stroke in patients
      with symptomatic as well as non-symptomatic carotid artery stenosis and is the most
      frequently performed surgical procedure to prevent stroke.

      However, CEA itself carries a risk of complications. Although the incidence of overt
      neurological injury associated with CEA is low, cognitive injuries not revealed in routine
      neurological examinations are believed to be as high as 20-30%.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the neuro-protective (brain-protecting) effect of
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug, dexmedetomidine and desflurane in
      patients undergoing a carotid endarterectomy surgery. We will also determine if
      administering anesthetics by intravenous route (through blood) is brain-protecting as
      compared to inhaled anesthetics administered. It is expected that the action of these
      techniques on brain will decrease the neurological (brain) damage after a period of
      decreased blood supply to the brain that normally occurs during the procedure. This
      neuroprotective action has already been demonstrated in animal studies.

      The goals for intraoperative anesthetic management of CEA include protection of the brain
      from ischemic injury. Dexmedetomidine has been found to be neuroprotective in vivo and vitro
      models of hypoxic-ischemic injury. We therefore propose to test whether intraoperative
      administration of dexmedetomidine will reduce postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction in
      patients undergoing CEA.

      Desflurane has been shown to be neuroprotective after incomplete cerebral ischemia.
      Desflurane not only attenuates the decrease but also increases brain tissue oxygenation and
      pH during ischemic injury and might improve neurological outcome. Neurocognitive outcomes
      may thus be superior with desflurane than with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). We thus
      also propose to test whether desflurane anesthesia reduces the incidence of postoperative
      neurocognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
