    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by carrying chemotherapy
      drugs directly into the tumor and blocking the blood flow to the tumor. Giving bevacizumab
      together with chemoembolization may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with
      chemoembolization works in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by
      surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Improve median progression-free survival of patients with unresectable hepatocellular
           cancer treated with bevacizumab and transarterial chemoembolization therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab once in weeks 1, 3, and 5. Beginning in week 3,
      patients also receive transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy. Treatment repeats
      approximately every 8 weeks for up to 3 courses. Patients achieving &lt; 100% necrosis by MRI
      after the first course receive 2 additional courses of bevacizumab and TACE.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
