  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative endophthalmitis, a possible severe complication of cataract surgery, is an
      infection of the anterior chamber of the eye caused by bacterial contamination and
      colonization through surgical incisions. Bacteria are thought to originate mainly from the
      patientâ€™s skin and studies show that bacteria are commonly found in the anterior chamber
      following surgery. However, innate immune defences are usually able to control and eliminate
      bacterial growth before postoperative endophthalmitis occurs. Also, due to the low incidence
      of postoperative endophthalmitis, it is difficult to accurately evaluate preventative
      methods. This study will examine the efficacy of topical preoperative administration of
      gatifloxacin (a new fourth generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic) on reduction of bacterial
      contamination of the anterior chamber following cataract surgery. If the antibiotic is shown
      to lower bacteria count in cultures from anterior chamber fluid, it has the potential to
      lower the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis.

      Patients undergoing cataract surgery will be notified and asked to participate in the study
      by the physician in advance of the surgery, provided they do not possess any exclusion
      criteria. The participants will be randomly split into two groups; one group will receive
      topical application of gatifloxacin prior to surgery, while the other group will receive no
      eye drops. During surgery, a small sample of anterior chamber fluid will be removed from the
      eye and cultured in both broth and enrichment media for all subjects. Bacterial growth,
      i.e., colony forming units (CFUs), will be used as an indicator of the bacterial
      contamination of the fluid.
