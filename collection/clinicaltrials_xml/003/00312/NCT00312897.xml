      Aim. To provide preliminary data about the efficacy of omega-3FA in the treatment of
      adolescent MDD. To address this aim, a 10-week double blind, placebo-controlled study of
      omega-3FA, using a flexible dose titration is proposed. Primary outcome measures will be:
      (1) change in the total score of the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) at
      the end of treatment (2) response rate on the Clinical Global Improvement scale (CGI) at the
      end of 10-week treatment.

      Hypothesis. Omega-3FA treatment in adolescents with MDD will result in a significant
      reduction of CDRS-R total scores, and a significantly higher improvement rate on the CGI at
      the end of treatment compared to placebo.

      Title: Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Adolescents with Depression

      NOTE: No individual will be advised to terminate ongoing treatment. If adolescents have been
      in psychotherapy prior to their entry in the study, they will be allowed to continue with
      the treatment. However, psychotherapy cannot be initiated at the time of entry into the
      study.

      Aim: To provide preliminary clinical data about the efficacy of omega-3FA (derived from fish
      oil) in the treatment of adolescent MDD. A NCCAM/NIH-funded study.

      Summary: Informed consent will be obtained from parent/guardian and assent obtained from
      participant. Interested participants will have a free diagnostic evaluation by study
      psychiatrist to determine eligibility. Routine blood tests and a urine pregnancy test will
      be obtained. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either omega-3FA or
      matching placebo (corn oil) for 10 weeks. Patients will be seen weekly throughout the trial.
      Dosage will be titrated based on clinical response and side effects. At end of double-blind
      phase, participants will be referred to a clinician who will be informed of subjects'
      treatment. Depending on treatment received during double-blind phase, post-study treatment
      options will include treatment with omega-3 fatty acids or an SSRI.
