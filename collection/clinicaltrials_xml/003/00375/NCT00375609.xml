    <textblock>
      Approximately 200 patients undergoing unilateral knee replacement will be entered into the
      study and randomized to receive either enoxaparin 30 mg sq bid, PRT054021 15 mg po bid, or
      PRT054021 40 mg po bid for 10 to 14 days, at which time patients will undergo venography.

               -  History (including family history) or symptoms of a congenital or acquired
                  bleeding disorder or vascular malformation; or a history of intracranial,
                  retroperitoneal, or intraocular bleeding within the last 6 months; or is felt to
                  be at high risk for bleeding for other reasons.
