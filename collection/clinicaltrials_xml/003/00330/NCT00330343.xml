  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated dose finding study designed to determine the optimal dose
      of naloxone to prevent or minimize the most common side effects induced by opioids, namely
      itching, nausea, and vomiting. Male and female inpatients of the Children’s Center of the
      Johns Hopkins Hospital, who are greater than 6 and less than 18 years of age with acute,
      moderate to severe pain, and who are to be treated with IVPCA morphine will be eligible for
      inclusion in this study. Patients will be recruited by a study investigator prior to the
      initiation of IVPCA therapy. The majority of patients will be post operative patients, and
      will start therapy and the investigational drug in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit or the
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. We plan on studying between 10 and 99, male and female
      patients over a 2 year period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients of all ages, opioids are the cornerstone of management of moderate to severe
      pain. Regardless of method of administration, all opioids produce unwanted side effects,
      including pruritus, nausea and vomiting, constipation, urinary retention, cognitive
      impairment, tolerance, dependence, and (rarely) respiratory depression. Based on the results
      of a previously completed randomized controlled trial, children and adolescents with
      moderate to severe pain, are now routinely treated in the Children’s Center of the Johns
      Hopkins Hospital with a low dose naloxone infusion (0.25 mcg/kg/HOUR) whenever morphine
      intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IVPCA) or parent/nurse controlled analgesia
      (IVPNCA) is initiated. Although the previous study showed a marked reduction in the
      incidence and severity of pruritus and nausea, approximately a third of our patients still
      experience these side effects. The primary purpose of this study is to reduce this failure
      rate by determining if there is an optimal dose of naloxone to prevent opioid induced side
      effects as determined by a dose finding classic up down dose escalation method. Our second
      aim is to detemine the pharmacokinetics of morphine and naloxone and their metabolites at
      each of the naloxone infusion rates attempted. We will measure morphine, naloxone, and their
      metabolites using a liquid chromatographic-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometric
      method (LC/MS/MS). Our final aim is to determine the pharmacogenetics of responders and
      non-responders using DNA isolated from patient blood. To accomplish this we will need a
      single blood collection from patients currently being treated with IVPCA morphine and low
      dose intravenous naloxone.
