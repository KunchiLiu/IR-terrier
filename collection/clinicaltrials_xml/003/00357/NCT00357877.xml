    <textblock>
      Adult tooth decay is an infectious disease that afflicts the majority of Americans aged 55
      and older and is the most common chronic disease at midlife with an ever growing economic
      toll. Despite the fact that specific bacteria cause tooth decay, no FDA-approved
      anti-microbial treatment for decay is available to the American dental professional. The
      Prevention of Adult Caries Study (PACS) is a study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a
      topical, temporary, 10% w/v chlorhexidine dental coating in reduce new decay in adult dental
      patients at risk for decay.

      Adult dental caries, including both coronal and root caries, is an infectious disease that
      afflicts the majority of Americans aged 55 and older and is the most common chronic disease
      at midlife. In addition, adult caries wreaks a significant economic toll, and this economic
      toll continues to grow. Despite the high prevalence and bacterial pathogenesis of caries, no
      FDA-approved anti-microbial treatment for caries is available to the American dental
      professional. The Prevention of Adult Caries Study (PACS) is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial conducted under F.D.A. Investigational New Drug
      license #45,466. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a topical, temporary,
      10% w/v chlorhexidine dental coating in reducing caries increment in at-risk adult dental
      patients. This study will follow 1000 patients over a 13-month study period at four centers
      with vastly diffent populations. The primary endpoint for this study will be caries
      increment. The centers participating in this proposed reaserch are: Kaiser Permanente's
      Dental Plan in Portland, Oregon; Tufts University Dental Clinic in central Boston,
      Massachusetts; Delta Dental Massachusetts' Dental Clinic in Southborough, Massachusetts; and
      the dental clinic of the Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation in Tuba City, Arizona.
      Kaiser Permanente's Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon will act as the
      data-coordinating center, and Tufts University will act as the Administrative Center.
