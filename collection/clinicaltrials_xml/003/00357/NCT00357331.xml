  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal buffering of chronic acid loads may contribute to a significant amount of bone loss
      over time. Evidence from a few small short-term studies suggests that basic compounds,
      namely potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate may reduce bone loss and improve bone
      density.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of potassium citrate on bone
      metabolism. We hypothesize that administration of potassium citrate to postmenopausal women
      with osteopenia will reduce bone resorption and improve bone mineral density.

      Postmenopausal women with osteopenia (T score between -1.0 and -2.5) and no history of
      fracture will be randomized to either daily potassium citrate or placebo for one year.
      Primary outcomes will be markers of bone turnover, which will be measured over 12 months.
      Secondary outcomes will be bone mineral density, compliance, and adverse events.
