  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the hemostatic efficacy and safety of continuous
      infusion versus intermittent bolus infusion in the peri- and post-operative setting,
      employing rAHF-PFM, a recombinant antihemophilic factor manufactured without added human or
      animal proteins, in previously treated patients with severe or moderately severe hemophilia
      A (baseline factor VIII level &lt;= 2% of normal) who are undergoing unilateral major
      orthopedic surgery that requires drain placement. The total study period per subject (from
      consent to study completion) will vary from approximately 9 to 26 weeks and will involve
      clinical and laboratory assessments.

    <description>Drainage fluid volume was to be measured cumulatively and recorded every 8 hours ± 30 minutes during the first 24 hours following surgery.

    <description>Drainage fluid volume was to be measured cumulatively and recorded every 8 hours ± 30 minutes during the first 24 hours following surgery. Prior to surgery, the operating surgeon was to predict the estimated duration of surgery and the volume (mL) of the estimated expected blood loss for the surgery in a hemostatically normal individual of the same sex, age, and stature as the study subject 1) for the intraoperative procedure (defined as the time period from incision to application of compressive dressing and release of tourniquet, if applicable), 2) for the first 24 hours postoperatively, and 3) for the postoperative period until drain removal, if drainage continued beyond 24 hours.

    <description>An initial loading dose will be administered intravenously over a period &lt;= 5 minutes (maximum of infusion rate of 10 mL/minute) within 60 minutes prior to surgery dose in order to maintain a minimum target FVIII level of at least 80% of normal.
CI will start prior to surgery as soon as the loading dose has been administered, at a rate calculated according to a formula provided by the sponsor.
All study product must be administered with a syringe pump running at an infusion rate according to the dosing regimen, but always &gt;= 0.4 mL/h.</description>
