      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To reverse hyperglycemia and insulin dependency in patients with type 1 diabetes
           mellitus through islet transplantation utilizing steroid free, calcineurin-inhibitor
           free immunosuppression.

        2. To assess the long-term function of successful islet transplants in patients with type
           1 diabetes mellitus utilizing islets that have undergone a period of culture.

        3. To determine whether the natural history of the microvascular, macrovascular, and
           neuropathic complications are altered following the successful transplantation of
           islets.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      The initial proposal submitted to the JDRFI was to compare 3 different groups of patients
      receiving islet cell transplants utilizing steroid-free, calcineurin-free protocols. The 3
      groups were as follows:

        1. Zenapax, Rapamycin &amp; MMF

        2. Campath, Rapamycin &amp; MMF, and

        3. Thymoglobulin, Rapamycin &amp; MMF.

      The grant was awarded in December 2003, however the recommendations were to focus on a
      single group (group 3 or 4) in order to determine the relative efficacy and toxicity of a
      new immunosuppressive drug combination. We elected to perform the group utilizing Campath,
      since we have a similar protocol utilizing the same immunosuppressive regimen with the
      addition of CD34+ enriched donor bone marrow cells (2000/0024). The results of this trial
      utilizing a steroid-free/calcineurin-free protocol will be compared with the standard
      &quot;Edmonton Protocol&quot; (2000/0196), which we are currently conducting (14 patients have been
      transplanted). In addition, the results will be compared with those in 2000/0024.

      Protocol 2000/0024 (utilizing the same immunosuppressive regimen; Campath, Rapamycin,
      Tacrolimus-switched to MMF at 3 months) is being followed by a DSMB established at the NIH.

      We propose to evaluate 12 patients with steroid free, long term calcineurin inhibitor free
      immunosuppression regimens which can be directly compared to our historical group of
      patients who underwent the Miami version of the Edmonton protocol (Islet Cell
      Transplantation Alone in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Steroid-Free
      Immunosuppression - Protocol # 2000/196) and with the concurrent tolerogenic protocol (Islet
      Cell Transplantation Alone and CD34+ Enriched Donor Bone Marrow Cell Infusion in Patients
      with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus; Steroid Free Regimen - Protocol # 2000/0024) which uses the
      same immunosuppressive regimen combined with CD34+ stem cell enriched donor bone marrow
      infusions.

      The regimen will consist of Campath 1-H induction, maintenance immunosuppression with
      sirolimus and tacrolimus for 3 months with subsequent introduction of mycophenolate mofetil
      (MMF) and removal of tacrolimus completely and TNF-alpha inhibition (etanercept) in the
      peri-transplant period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Potential candidates must have type 1 diabetes mellitus and fulfill one or more of the
        following:

          1. Manifest signs and symptoms that are severe enough to be incapacitating.
             Incapacitating signs and symptoms include hypoglycemic episodes requiring assistance
             by others and hypoglycemia unawareness (the inability to recognize low blood
             glucoses; glucoses &lt; 54 mg/dl). These patients are at high risk for involvement in
             accidents (they can lose consciousness or act irrationally), thus causing harm to
             themselves and/or others.

          2. Patients with poor diabetes control (HbA1c &gt; 8.0% but &lt; 12%), despite intensive
             insulin therapy, as defined by: self monitoring of blood glucose ≥ 4 times/day,
             multiple insulin injections (≥ 3/day) or insulin pump, and close monitoring of blood
             glucose control by an endocrinologist. These patients can experience acute, rapid
             hyperglycemia secondary to several stress factors, that can lead to dehydration,
             disorientation, and in some instances, ketoacidosis.

          3. Progressive diabetic complications. These patients with chronically poor glycemic
             control are at higher risk for the development of a wide variety of complications
             (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease) associated with
             diabetes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Potential candidates will be excluded as per the following criteria:

          1. Age &lt; 18 or &gt; 65 years

          2. Duration of diabetes &lt; 5 years

          5. Weight &gt; 80 kg

          6. Insulin requirement &gt; 1.0 u/kg/d

          7. HbA1c &gt; 12%

         11. Macroalbuminuria (&gt; 300 mg/24 hours)

         12. Anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 12.0 g/dl for males; &lt; 11 g/dl for females)

         13. Hyperlipidemia (fasting low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol &gt; 130 mg/dl and/or
             fasting triglycerides &gt; 200 mg/dl)

         14. Abnormal liver function tests (consistently &gt; 1.5 x normal range)

         15. Serological evidence of HIV, HBsAg and/or HBcAb, HBsAb without history of
             vaccination, human t cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), or hepatitis C virus (HCV)

         16. Negative serology for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or evidence of acute or chronic
             infection (IgM ≥ IgG)

         17. Lack of updated immunizations per current Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
             guidelines (including lack of immunization against hepatitis B, pneumococcus and
             influenza - during season)

         18. Presence of panel reactive antibodies &gt; 20%

         19. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &gt; 4 ng/ml unless malignancy is ruled out

         20. Positive tuberculin test (unless proof of adequate treatment for latent tuberculosis
             can be provided)

         21. X-ray evidence of pulmonary infection or other significant pathology

         22. Gall stones and/or portal hypertension and/or hemangioma on liver ultrasound

         23. Abnormal abdominal or pelvic ultrasound (evidence of masses that are considered
             suspicious for malignancy or adenopathy)

         24. Active peptic ulcer disease

         25. Active infections

         26. Unstable cardiovascular status (including positive stress echocardiography if age &gt;
             35)

         27. Untreated or unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy

         28. Previous/concurrent organ transplantation (except for failed islet cell or pancreas
             transplantation)

         29. Malignancy or previous malignancy

         30. Any medical condition requiring chronic use of steroids

         31. Active alcohol or substance abuse; smoking in the last 6 months.

               -  surgically sterile, or

                  alone are not acceptable)

         33. Positive pregnancy test or intent for future pregnancy, or male subject's intent to
             procreate
