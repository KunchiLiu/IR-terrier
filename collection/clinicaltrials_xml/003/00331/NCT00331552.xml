    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and cyclophosphamide,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving more
      than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with trastuzumab may be a better way to
      block tumor growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the optimal tolerated dose of Doxil when given in
      combination with daily oral cyclophosphamide in patients with stage IV breast cancer. (Phase
      I) II. To determine the efficacy (overall clinical response rate) of the optimal tolerated
      dose of Doxil when given in combination with daily oral cyclophosphamide and herceptin (for
      HER2 neu positive patients) in patients with stage IV breast cancer. (Phase II) SECONDARY
      OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the treatment related toxicity associated with each dose level of
      this regimen and assess efficacy (overall clinical response rate). (Phase I) II. To assess
      the safety (treatment related toxicity) of the optimal tolerated dose of Doxil when given in
      combination with daily oral cyclophosphamide and herceptin (for HER2 neu positive patients)
      in patients with stage IV breast cancer. (Phase II) III. To assess time to progression and
      overall survival following treatment with Doxil and daily oral cyclophosphamide and
      herceptin (for HER2 neu positive patients). (Phase II) IV. To compare the response rate in
      patients who are heavily pretreated to the response rate in patients who are less heavily
      pretreated. OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pegylated doxorubicin HCl
      liposome followed by a phase II feasibility study. Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide
      once daily on days 1-28 and pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 90 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Some patients with HER2/neu 3+ disease may also receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90
      minutes weekly or every 3 weeks at the discretion of the treating physician. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
