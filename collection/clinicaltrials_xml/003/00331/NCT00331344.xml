  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ixabepilone and
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride when given together with prednisone and to see how well they work
      in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy
      and chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug
      (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of the
      combination of ixabepilone, mitoxantrone hydrochloride, and prednisone in patients with
      hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer that progressed during or after taxane-based
      chemotherapy. (Phase I) II. Assess the efficacy, as measured by reduction in
      prostate-specific antigen, of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the overall safety of this regimen as second-line chemotherapy in these
      patients.

      II. Evaluate the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, open label, dose-escalation study of mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride and ixabepilone followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and
      ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1 and oral prednisone twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for ≥ 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of mitoxantrone hydrochloride and
      ixabepilone until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride and ixabepilone at the MTD determined
      in phase I and prednisone as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

    <description>This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 for adverse event monitoring and reporting. Toxicities will be tabulated by grade for each dose cohort and overall for all patients accrued to the phase I study.</description>

    <time_frame>Course 1 (first 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Cohorts of 3 patients will be enrolled at each dose level; if 1 DLT is observed then the cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If a second DLT is observed, the previous dose level will be considered the MTD. If all observed DLT are due to neuropathy (specific to ixabepilone), then we would consider the previous dose level of Ixabepilone the MTD for that drug, and escalate mitoxantrone hydrochloride as described above to a maximum dose of 12 mg/m^2. Toxicities will be tabulated by grade for each dose cohort and overall for all patients accrued to the phase I study.</description>

    <time_frame>Every 3 courses</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics will be calculated to characterize the disease and treatment factors including the proportion responding with a 95% confidence interval. If accrual is completed and more than 15 of 58 patients show &gt; 50% PSA declines after 3 courses, then the null hypothesis of a 20% response proportion will be rejected. PSA declines for individual patients will be plotted in the form of a waterfall diagram of maximal PSA declines.</description>
