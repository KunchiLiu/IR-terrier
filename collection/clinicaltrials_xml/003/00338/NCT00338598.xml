    <textblock>
      This placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of glycine, an agonist of
      the glycine-B co-agonist site of the NMDA receptor, on alcohol consumption and craving as
      well as negative symptoms in schizophrenia.

      Glycine will decrease the rewarding action of ethanol and reduce ethanol consumption. Also,
      glycine will improve negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

      OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenia affects about 1% of the general population and is a highly
      disabling disease. Additionally, the rate of alcohol dependency for patients with
      schizophrenia is very high. There are no established treatments for alcohol dependency and
      negative symptoms in schizophrenia. This study will examine whether the addition of glycine
      to neuroleptic medications will help patients with schizophrenia and alcoholism decrease
      their drinking as well as improve negative symptoms.

      RESEARCH PLAN: An abnormality of the glutamate neurotransmitter system has been hypothesized
      for both alcoholism and schizophrenia. Studies suggest that the amino acid glycine may
      improve alcohol dependency and symptoms of schizophrenia by acting on the N methyl D
      aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor. Glycine causes reversal of the effects of ethanol in
      animal studies and improves mood, social withdrawal and other so called &quot;negative symptoms&quot;
      of schizophrenia. Consequently, the use of glycine by patients with schizophrenia and
      alcohol dependency may potentially decrease alcohol craving and alcohol consumption and also
      improve certain symptoms of schizophrenia. The potential of glycine to improve both alcohol
      dependency and negative symptoms could represent an important step in the improvement of the
      quality of life for patients with schizophrenia.

      METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS/RESULTS: In order to test this hypothesis, we will use a double blind,
      placebo controlled study and measure the number of drinks, the degree of craving for alcohol
      and symptoms of schizophrenia among other parameters. Our principal approach to analyses of
      medication effectiveness will be the application of the linear mixed effect model. The
      linear mixed effect model permits a flexible approach for studying change in individuals
      through time as a random effect, and does not require all patients to have data at all
      measured points. Our principal model of analysis includes treatment (placebo or glycine), as
      between subject factor, and time, as within subject factor. Compliance will be also included
      as a time varying independent variable. This project continues to recruit subjects.
