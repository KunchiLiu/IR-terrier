    <textblock>
      This research study involves the use of the drugs Letrozole, GnRH, and NAL-GLU GnRH
      antagonist. Letrozole is a drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for use in breast cancer treatment that has been found to block the formation of
      estrogen. The NAL-GLU GnRH antagonist is a drug that temporarily blocks the action of GnRH.
      GnRH is a hormone that the body makes that stimulates other hormones that then control the
      function of the ovary.

      The purpose is to study the effects of the administration of letrozole in women with GnRH
      deficiency at the same time that they receive gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In
      addition, administration of letrozole and NAL-GLU GnRH antagonist in healthy women with
      normal menstrual cycles will be done to evaluate the role of estrogen in the control of the
      hormone FSH, or Follicle Stimulating Hormone, in the female reproductive cycle. A better
      understanding of FSH control may help in the development of new treatments for women with
      difficulty conceiving.

      The negative feedback control of FSH is crucial for the precise regulation of follicular
      development in the female. An important component of this feedback is exerted by estrogen.
      Letrozole will be used to block aromatase and therefore estradiol production in normal and
      GnRH deficient females. These studies will dissect the relative roles of estradiol and
      inhibin on FSH secretion at the pituitary and hypothalamus.

      The aromatase inhibitors block aromatization of androgens to estrogens, allowing us to
      examine the relative contribution of estradiol and inhibin to FSH regulation. Using normal
      subjects and GnRH-deficient subjects receiving replacement GnRH allows us to compare the
      effect of relative estradiol blockade at the pituitary (GnRH deficient subjects) vs the
      pituitary and hypothalamus (normal subjects), thus determining the direct site of estradiol
      action.

      A more thorough understanding of estrogen and inhibin feedback on FSH will improve our
      understanding of the failure of follicle development in subsets of patients with
      infertility, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, in which FSH levels are normal but follicles
      fail to develop. Study of FSH control will also help us understand the failure of negative
      feedback on FSH, which can result in multiple follicular development and multiple gestation
      and its associated costs and risks. Thus, these studies may afford new therapeutic options
      for conception in infertile patients while simultaneously providing new methods to avoid the
      risks of multiple gestations.
