      The goal is to conduct a clinical pilot study to evaluate the use of a rotating
      multi-segment slant-hole collimator in the detection of myocardial defects.

      Myocardial perfusion SPECT is recognized as an effective clinical diagnostic imaging
      technique in the assessment of myocardial perfusion and coronary artery diseases. It is the
      most important clinical application of SPECT imaging techniques.

      The goal is to conduct a clinical pilot study to evaluate the use of RMSSH SPECT in the
      detection of myocardial defects especially in very sick patients in the nuclear medicine
      clinics, emergence room, and intensive care units. Comparison of the clinical utilities of
      the cardiac RMSSH SPECT technique with conventional cardiac planar and SPECT with
      parallel-hole collimation will also allow us to evaluate the potential application of the
      technique to a wider patient population.

      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that quantitative 99mTc myocardial
      perfusion RMSSH SPECT provides similar diagnostic accuracy in patients with cardiac diseases
      as conventional SPECT imaging techniques.
