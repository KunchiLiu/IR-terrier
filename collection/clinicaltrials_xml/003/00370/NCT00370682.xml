      This descriptive study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of different formulations
      of the WRAIR dengue vaccine compared to a placebo.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized into one of three groups. One group will receive a placebo
      vaccine and the other two will receive different dengue vaccine formations. Each subject
      will receive two doses six months apart. All subjects will have 11 venipunctures during 11
      visits (i.e., screening plus 10 study visits) over a period of nine months.

             examination before entering into the study;

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject;

          -  Able to read the Subject Information Sheet and Consent Form;

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits)
             should be enrolled in the study;

          -  females must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. surgically sterilized or, if of

             patch or injectable contraceptives) for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative
             pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to vaccination and must agree to continue such
             precautions for 60 days after completion of the vaccination series

             vaccine within 30 days preceding the study vaccine (includes placebo) or planned use
             during the study period;

          -  Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the
             period starting from 30 days before the first dose of the study vaccine/placebo and
             ending 30 days after the second dose;

          -  A planned move to a location that will prohibit participating in the trial for 9
             months after the initial vaccination;

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within 90 days preceding the first dose or planned
             administration during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean
             prednisone, or equivalent, 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed;

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or blood products within 90 days preceding the
             first dose or planned administration during the study period;

          -  Any chronic systemic drug therapy to be continued during the study period (except for
