      To evaluate and compare the expression and change in expression of key severe asthma targets
      at baseline in mile to moderate asthmatics vs. severe asthmatic subjects.

      To evaluate and compare the airway pathology at baseline and changes in airway pathology in
      relation to asthma severity.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  History of asthma with exclusion of other significant pulmonary disease.

          -  Body Mass Index between 19-31 kg.m-2.

          -  Subjects will be assigned to group 1(mild to moderate) or Group 2 (severe asthmatics)
             depending on their Lung Function test results.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  As a result of medical interview, physical examination or screening investigation the
             physician responsible considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  History of drug or other allergy, which, in the opinion of the responsible physician,
             contra-indicates their participation.

          -  Subject is female who is pregnant or lactating.

          -  Currently or planning to take during the study regular medication (including
             over-the-counter) except for medication allowed in inclusion criteria.

          -  Having participated within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer of the first
             dose in a study using new molecular entity, or the first dose in any other study
             investigating drugs or having participated within one month of the first dose in a
             study with invasive procedures.

          -  History or current evidence of an upper or lower respiratory infection or symptoms
             (including common cold) within 2 weeks of baseline assessments.

          -  History of abnormal bruising or bleeding.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Doing night-shift work within at least 5 days prior to dosing until completion of the
             study.

          -  Anticoagulants except low dose of Aspirin (80 mg per day) (for bronchoscopy).

          -  Beta blockers except for low dose Atenolol (25 mg/day) or Metoprolol (50 mg/day) (for
             bronchoscopy).

          -  Use of Cytochrome P450 inhibitors.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the following medications: Lidocaine, Fentanyl,
             Versed, Demerol, Midazolam, Epinephrine, Flumazenil and Naloxone.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to bronchodilator (such as Albuterol).

        In addition, the following additional exclusion criteria must apply to mild to moderate
        persistent asthmatics on regular inhaled steroids:

          -  Changed asthma medication within the 4 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Has had an asthma exacerbation in the previous month.

          -  Known sensitivity or allergy to prednisolone.

          -  Current use or use within the previous 3 months of oral corticosteroids.

          -  Current use of Methotrexate, cyclosporine and PDE inhibitors

          -  History of tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, severe hypertension,
             glaucoma , severe affective disorder and peptic ulceration.

        In addition, the following additional exclusion criteria must apply to severe persistent
        asthmatics with clinical controlled asthma symptoms:

          -  Changed asthma medication within the 4 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Has had an asthma exacerbation in the previous month.

          -  sensitivity or allergy to prednisolone.

          -  History of tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, hypertension, glaucoma,
             severe affective disorder and peptic ulceration.

          -  Current use or use within the previous 4 weeks of oral prednisolone or equivalent of
             greater than 20mg daily.
