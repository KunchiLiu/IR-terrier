  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether long-term chronic alcoholism is associated
      with changes in emotional functioning and brain structure and function.

      This research investigates brain structure and function in alcoholics compared to healthy
      nonalcoholic individuals. Alcoholics have shown impairments in cognitive processing of
      emotional signals. Some alcoholics are impaired in social skills, and many are unable to
      implement the strategies for interpersonal interactions that they recommend for themselves.
      For example, alcoholics have difficulty interpreting non-verbal emotional cues and
      recognizing facial expressions of emotion. When listening to sentences, alcoholics also have
      some difficulty judging emotional intonations and emotional content. In our research, we are
      trying to understand where in the brain these emotional behaviors take place, and whether or
      not the brain functions differently for alcoholic and nonalcoholic individuals. We present
      emotional words and pictures on a computer screen, and using MRI scans, we observe how the
      brain works when people purposefully respond to the words and pictures. Additionally, we are
      comparing brain structure and activation patterns in men and women, because there may be
      gender differences in responses to emotional stimuli.

        The study populations include alcoholics and demographically equivalent healthy controls.
        Potential participants who have participated in one or more of our prior studies are
        contacted by telephone to determine whether or not they would like to participate again.
        Potential participants who have not previously been enlisted in any of our studies are
        recruited through fliers placed in the Boston Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, Boston
        University School of Medicine, and after-care programs in the Boston area, and through
        advertisements placed with local newspapers and web sites. For these &quot;new&quot; participants,
        subject selection procedures include an initial prescreening telephone interview to
        determine identifying information such as age, level of education, health history, and
        history of alcohol and drug use. Those eligible are invited to the laboratory for further
        screening and neuropsychological evaluations.
