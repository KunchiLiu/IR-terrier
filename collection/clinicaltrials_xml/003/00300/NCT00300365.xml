      -  Aim 1: We will test our primary hypothesis that combining niacin extended release
           (niacin-ER), at a daily dosage of up to 2.0 g with pioglitazone, at a daily dosage of
           45 mg will result in a 12% greater increase in HDL-C when compared to niacin-ER
           monotherapy over 12 weeks in non-diabetic patients with the metabolic syndrome (see
           Table 1).

        -  Aim 2: In this secondary aim, we will test our hypothesis that the combination of
           niacin-ER and pioglitazone will significantly increase insulin sensitivity, when
           compared to niacin-ER alone, as measured by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose
           tolerance test (FSIGTT).

        -  Aim 3: In this additional secondary aim, we will test our hypothesis that the
           combination of pioglitazone and niacin-ER will reduce markers of inflammation,
           including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor
           alpha receptor type II (sTNF--R2), and resistin, and raise adiponectin when compared
           to niacin-ER alone.

        -  Aim 4: In this exploratory aim, we will measure a broad spectrum of emerging
           cardiovascular risk factors in order to derive a richer sense of the effects of
           combination pioglitazone and niacin-ER in these individuals. We will collect adipose
           tissue level expression (mRNA &amp; protein) relating to cholesterol transport (PPAR-,
           PPAR-, and PPAR-, ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-B1), triglyceride transport/lipolysis (HM74a,
           HSL), adipocytokines (TNF-a, IL-6, adiponectin, leptin, acylation-stimulating protein),
           and glucose regulation (glut-4 and IRS-1). [assuming sufficient mRNA yield]. These
           findings will serve as hypothesis-generating data for future studies..

      This is a two-arm, parallel, double-blind randomized prospective clinical trial. The
      subjects will be asked to provide informed consent, and then undergo screening for
      enrollment criteria at the first visit (-5 weeks). The subjects who are eligible, and
      provide informed consent will return for Visit 2 baseline data (-4 weeks), and then begin
      the unblinded niacin-ER titration. Specifically, subjects will receive a starting dose of
      niacin-ER of 500 mg per day, which will be increased in 500 mg increments every week up to a
      dose of 2000 mg per day. Subjects will need to tolerate at least 1500 mg per day of
      niacin-ER in order to remain in the study and be randomized. Thus subjects who are unable to
      tolerate the 2000 mg daily dose of niacin-ER will be taken back to 1500 mg per day for one
      week and then randomized. Subjects who develop prohibitive side effects at doses less than
      1500 mg per day will be discontinued from the study. All subjects who are able to take the
      target dose of niacin-ER will continue that dose of niacin-ER and come to the GCRC to be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either niacin-ER plus pioglitazone or niacin-ER plus matching
      placebo for 12 weeks. Pioglitazone will be started at 30 mg and then increased to 45 mg at
      week 6. This entry design is designed to minimize the differences in mean dose of niacin-ER
      and dropout rate between study groups.
