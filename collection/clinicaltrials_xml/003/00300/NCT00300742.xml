      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of using topiramate to reduce binge
      eating and drinking episodes in alcohol dependent individuals with comorbid binge eating
      disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown an alarming coincidence of binge eaters also reporting serious alcohol
      abuse. Evidence has shown this population to have higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity,
      higher caloric intakes during meals, higher rates of tobacco use, more frequent binge
      episodes, and an earlier age of onset for binge eating and alcohol abuse. It is believed
      that topiramate may reduce binge eating and has been found helpful in reducing the cravings
      associated with alcohol consumption.

      This study is to test the feasibility of administering topiramate to individuals with
      alcohol dependence and binge eating disorder. This will involve determining the adequacy of
      the amount of assessment and scheduled visits.
