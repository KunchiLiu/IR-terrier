      The objective of the study is to confirm the superiority of the intensive therapy to the
      conventional therapy concerning the prevention of the incidence or exacerbation of vascular
      complications caused by diabetes mellitus (DM) by a randomized controlled study in patients
      with type 2 DM.

      The objective of the study is to confirm the superiority of the intensive therapy to the
      conventional therapy concerning the prevention of the incidence or exacerbation of vascular
      complications caused by diabetes mellitus by a randomized controlled study in patients with
      type 2 DM. The primary outcome measure is occurrence of myocardial infarction, coronary
      bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stroke, carotid
      endarterectomy, percutaneous transluminal cerebral angioplasty, carotid artery stenting, or
      death.

    <description>Behavioral: Lifestyle modification including weight control, with the goal of BMI 22.
Drug: Drugs are added in a stepwise manner to control blood glucose, blood pressure and lipid metabolism, using mainly hypoglycemic drugs, ACEI/ARB and statins, respectively. Management goals are: HbA1c &lt; 6.2%, BP &lt; 120/75 mmHg, HDL-C 40 mg/dL , LDL-C &lt; 80 mg/dL, TG &lt; 120 mg/dL.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Subjects were considered eligible if they were 45 years old or older
        but younger than 70 years old at study entry, had type 2 diabetes and met both &quot;(1) and
        (2)&quot; or both &quot;(1) and (3)&quot; described below. [Note: Those who met all three &quot;(1), (2) and
        (3)&quot; were also considered eligible for inclusion.](1) Glycemic control Those with HbA1c
        6.9% or greater despite treatment with any of the three regimens given below. Diet and
        exercise therapy alone, Diet and exercise therapy plus 1 oral anti-diabetic drug, Diet and
        exercise therapy plus, GI and 1 other oral anti-anti-diabetic drug (2) Blood pressure
        control Those with the following casual blood pressure (BP) level as measured on an
        outpatient basis, Systolic BP 140 mmHg or diastolic BP 90 mmHg while not on an
        antihypertensive agent, Systolic BP 130 mmHg or diastolic BP 80 mmHg while on 1 or 2 ARB,
        ACEI or long-acting CCB Those receiving antihypertensive agents other than ARB, ACEI or
        long-acting CCB were not eligible for study entry, with the exception of those who were
        receiving these agents for other purposes than blood pressure lowering. (3) Lipid
        metabolism Those with the following fasting lipid levels while not on a lipid-lowering
        agent LDL-cholesterol, 120 mg/dL (as calculated by using the Friedewald formula)
        Triglycerides, 150 mg/dL HDL-cholesterol, &lt; 40 mg/dL Subjects receiving 1 lipid-lowering
        agent were judged eligible for study entry if they met any of the above criteria. However,
        care needs to be taken to ensure that those on fibrates discontinue the fibrate treatment
        at the start of the study when they are assigned to the intensive therapy arm.

        Exclusion Criteria: 1. Those with poorly controlled hypertension despite pharmacological
        therapy (systolic BP 200 mmHg or diastolic BP 120 mmHg) 2. Those on insulin therapy 3.
        Those with non-diabetic renal disease 4. Those in whom type 1 and other diabetes due to
        pathogenic mechanisms other than those associated with type 2 diabetes is strongly
        suspected 5. Those who tested anti-GAD antibody*-positive 6. Those with LDL-cholesterol
        200 mg/dL 7. Those suspected of having secondary hypertension other than renal parenchymal
        hypertension 8. Those suspected of having hereditary lipid disorder with a strong family
        history of lipid metabolic disorder 9. Those who were receiving antihypertensive agents
        other than ARB, ACEI, long-acting CCB, except where they were receiving these agents for
        other purposes than blood pressure lowering 10. Those who were receiving 3 or more
        antihypertensive agents (i.e., ARB, ACEI, and long-acting CCB), except where they were
        receiving these agents for other purposes than blood pressure lowering 11. Those with more
        serious retinopathy than proliferative retinopathy 12. Renal failure (serum Cr: 2.0 mg/dL
        in men; 1.5 mg/dL in women) 13. Those with a history of cardiac failure or those with
        cardiac failure 14. Those who were pregnant or potentially pregnant 15. Those who met any
        of the following criteria and who had BNP 100 pg/mL, Myocardial infarction, Angina
        pectoris (or a history of disease), History of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG),
        History of percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA), Other cardiac disease, ECG findings
        of left ventricular hyperplasia, Abnormal ECG findings (excluding isolated extrasystole or
        right bundle branch block [RBBB]) 16. Those judged by the physician in charge to be
        ineligible for study entry
