    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to first define whether abnormalities of skeletal muscle are
      related to the presence of inflammation and to poor motor performance and whether this can
      be modified by exercise interventions.

      Background: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Biological
      changes in hemiparetic skeletal muscle may further propagate the disability. The
      investigators report gross muscular atrophy and major shift to fast myosin heavy chain (MHC)
      isoform distribution in hemiparetic thigh that are related to reduced fitness and slow
      walking speed. The investigators also find elevated inflammatory mediators, TNFa and NFkB in
      the paretic thigh muscle. No prior studies have systematically examined the profile of
      hemiparetic muscle contractile proteins and their relationship to function and fitness after
      stroke. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying hemiparetic skeletal muscle atrophy
      and contractile protein abnormalities are unknown.

      The investigators have investigated treadmill aerobic exercise (T-AEX), as a task-oriented
      training model. This exercise model can reverse the alterations in MHC profile in
      hemiparetic leg muscles after stroke. This T-AEX program also improves fitness levels, leg
      strength, and ambulatory performance in chronic stroke. Moreover, post hoc analyses our
      randomized treadmill exercise program show that specific features of the exercise
      prescription likely influence the nature of exercise-mediated adaptations. Specifically, The
      investigators find that the degree of training velocity progression predicts gains in VO2
      peak, but not walking function. In contrast, increasing training duration is associated with
      improved 6-minute walking function, but not fitness gains. These findings provide initial
      evidence that cardiovascular metabolic adaptations are contingent upon advancing the
      training velocity, rather than training duration. These exercise-mediated changes in MHC
      profiles and inflammation might be extremely important in the context of muscle structure
      and function, ambulation and overall fitness.

      Hypothesis: The investigators propose a randomized clinical study to investigate the
      hypothesis that in chronic stroke patients a 6 month velocity-based progressive T-AEX
      program is superior to duration-based progressive T-AEX for improving HP leg skeletal muscle
      contractile protein expression and reducing inflammatory markers to improve muscle function,
      fitness, and ambulation.

      Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether skeletal muscle MHC isoform expression is altered and
      inflammatory mediators, TNF and markers of NFkB activation, present in the hemiparetic
      vastus lateralis muscle, compared the non-paretic leg and matched non-stroke control leg
      muscles, and related to muscle function, fitness, and gait performance. 2) Determine whether
      6 months progressive T-AEX programs can attenuate this abnormal MHC profile and inflammatory
      mediators to improve muscle structure and function.

      Methods: At baseline, bilateral VL biopsies are obtained from chronically disabled, stroke
      participants with hemiparetic gait to examine the HP and non-P thigh skeletal muscles for
      alterations in MHC isoforms, key muscle contractile protein, and evidence for inflammation
      (TNFa) and NFkB activation. Participants are randomized to 6 months of progressive
      velocity-based or duration-based T-AEX training. Repeat VL muscle biopsies are obtained in
      the HP limb only after exercise interventions to assess whether 6-month exercise
      rehabilitation can restore MHC profile and attenuate activation of inflammatory pathways.
      Expression of the specific MHC isoforms, TNF, and NFKB marker expression (mRNA and protein)
      are investigated in these muscle tissues by real-time RT-PCR, Western Blot analysis, and
      immunohistochemistry. The investigators will explore relationships between T-AEX mediated
      changes in MHC expression and inflammatory activation in skeletal muscle after stroke to
      improve muscle strength, muscle performance, fitness and activity levels, ADL performance,
      and gait deficit severity.

      Anticipated Results and Relevance: The cross-sectional baseline data will provide the first
      systematic study of a substantial cohort of stroke patients to define the relationship
      between altered structural and contractile protein expression to both muscle physiology and
      clinical measures of muscle performance, metabolic fitness, and rehabilitation mobility
      outcomes. HP VL muscle will be directly compared to the non-P limb muscle within -subjects
      and to non-stroke reference controls, in order to better understand the scope of skeletal
      muscle inflammatory and metabolic abnormalities in the stroke population. The intervention
      results will allow us to determine the specific requirements of treadmill training that are
      optimal and crucial to produce the exercise-mediated adaptations in hemiparetic skeletal
      muscle that lead to improved rehabilitation outcomes to reduce the disability of chronic
      stroke.
