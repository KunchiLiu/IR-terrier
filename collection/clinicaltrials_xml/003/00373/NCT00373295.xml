      The purpose of this study is to determine if baclofen dose-dependently decreases marijuana's
      direct effects and symptoms of marijuana withdrawal and thus decreases marijuana relapse.

    <textblock>
      Only a small percentage of dependent-marijuana smokers who are seeking treatment for their
      marijuana use are able to achieve sustained abstinence. The objective of this study is to
      investigate the interaction between marijuana and the potential treatment medication,
      baclofen, with the direct goal of using this information to improve marijuana treatment
      outcome. GABAB agonists such as baclofen have been shown to attenuate the
      self-administration of cocaine, heroin, alcohol and nicotine (see Cousins et al., 2002;
      Haney et al., 2006). Baclofen also appears to decrease withdrawal symptoms in heroin and
      alcohol abusers (Akhondzadeh et al., 2000; Addolorato et al., 2000). The purpose of this
      study is to determine if baclofen dose-dependently decreases marijuana's direct effects and
      symptoms of marijuana withdrawal and thus decreases marijuana relapse in our laboratory
      model. For the purposes of this model, relapse is defined as a return to marijuana use after
      a period of abstinence. The study will utilize an inpatient/outpatient, counter-balanced
      design, with each participant maintained on each of three medication conditions for 16 days:
      placebo and baclofen (60, 90 mg/day). Participants will begin taking capsules during the
      outpatient phase so that the dose can be incremented up to the maintenance dose prior to the
      first inpatient day. Further, clinical studies have shown that baclofen is most effective at
      decreasing cocaine's effects when administered for several weeks. During the inpatient study
      phases, participants will have the opportunity to self-administer placebo or active
      marijuana 6 times per day. This study will provide important information of the effect of
      baclofen as a potential treatment medication for marijuana dependence.
