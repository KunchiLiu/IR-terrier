      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether aripiprazole will decrease cocaine
      self-administration, subjective effects and cravings compared to placebo.

      Despite the recent increase in data about cocaine's basic neurochemical mechanisms of
      action, progress towards the development of an effective pharmacological treatment for
      cocaine abuse has been disappointing. We are proposing to use our laboratory model of
      repeated dose cocaine self-administration to assess the potential efficacy of the novel
      antipsychotic, aripiprazole. Aripiprazole is a partial agonist at both the dopamine D2
      receptor and at the serotonin 5HT1a receptor, while antagonizing the 5HT2a receptor. By
      functioning as a partial D2 agonist, aripiprazole is hypothesized to function as a D2
      antagonist during hypodopaminergic states, such as during cocaine use, while functioning as
      a D2 agonist during hypodopaminergic states, such as during cocaine withdrawal. This 42-day,
      outpatient/inpatient/outpatient/inpatient protocol will evaluate the effects of aripiprazole
      maintenance (0, 15 mg/day) on cocaine craving, subjective effects, and self-administration
      using a within-subjects design. Non-treatment seeking cocaine abusers will be maintained
      outpatient for 16 days of dose maintenance prior to inpatient cocaine self-administration
      sessions. During the inpatient phases, volunteers will live on a hospital clinical research
      unit and will participate in laboratory sessions in which they will have the opportunity to
      choose between repeated doses of smoked cocaine and $5. In addition to measuring their
      cocaine self-administration, we will measure the cardiovascular and subjective effects of
      cocaine under each aripiprazole maintenance condition.
