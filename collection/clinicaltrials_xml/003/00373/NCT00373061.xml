      The Xolair Pregnancy Registry is an observational study established by Genentech to obtain
      data on pregnancy outcomes in women who are exposed to Xolair. Women exposed to at least one
      dose of Xolair within 8 weeks prior to conception or at any time during their pregnancy will
      be followed to completion of their pregnancies. The evaluation of infants will be conducted
      at birth and at 6-month intervals until infants are 12 months old.

        Enrollment in the Xolair Pregnancy Registry is voluntary and must be initiated by the
        pregnant woman. A healthcare provider (HCP) cannot enroll a patient but can suggest that
        the pregnant woman call the Registry Center to enroll herself.
