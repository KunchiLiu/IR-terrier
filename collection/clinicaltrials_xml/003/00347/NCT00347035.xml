      Purpose:

      To evaluate the influence of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory indomethacin on the
      brimonidine intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect.

      Methods:

      A randomized double-masked study was carried out. Patients medicated with timolol maleate
      0,5% and needed complementary medication were random allocated into two groups: (a)
      brimonidine tartarate 0,15% and indomethacin 1% or (b) brimonidine tartarate and placebo
      (balanced saline solution). If patient’s both eyes were eligible, they were allocated to the
      same group.

      IOP was measured at two weeks, one month and two months after study beginning. The mean IOP
      of the eyes was used for analyzes, in the case of two eligible eyes. For statistical
      analyzes repeated measures analysis was used.
