  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trachoma, an ocular infection caused by C. trachomatis, is the second leading cause of
      blindness worldwide.Years of repeated infection with C. trachomatis cause the eyelid to scar
      and contract and ultimately to rotate inward such that eyelashes rub against the eyeball and
      abrade the cornea (trichiasis). The World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed a
      multi-faceted strategy to combat trachoma, which includes surgery to correct trichiasis.
      Despite this encouraging news, under the best of circumstances the recurrence rate of
      trichiasis following surgery is disappointingly high. The objective of our project is to
      conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial of post-surgical antibiotic treatment,
      comparing oral azithromycin to topical tetracycline, for trichiasis surgical patients in
      Ethiopia with the goal of determining the impact of treatment on rates of trichiasis
      recurrence at one and two years.

    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial of the effectiveness of a single dose of azithromycin compared
      to 6 weeks of topical tetracycline, and the added benefit of family-based azithromycin
      treatment, in preventing recurrence of trichiasis following surgery is proposed. This will
      provide the evidence base to inform and change the global public health policy and the
      donation program policy, regarding post-surgical treatment for trichiasis patients and
      possibly their families.

      The investigators will determine the impact of three treatment strategies following
      trichiasis surgery on the rate of trichiasis recurrence in the operated eye at six months
      and one year. A randomized clinical trial of 1425 trichiasis surgical patients will be
      conducted in Sodo,Ethiopia. The first group (Control Group) will receive topical
      tetracycline following surgery; the second group (Intervention Patient Group) will receive
      oral azithromycin; the third group (Intervention Family Group) will receive oral
      azithromycin, and all family members resident in the patient's household will also receive
      oral azithromycin. Data will be collected at baseline (pre-surgery) on ocular status and
      infection status. Data will be collected at the time of surgery on surgery-related variables
      and surgical and post-operative complications. Additional data will be collected on any
      surgical complications and early recurrence at the two-week visit when sutures will be
      removed. A follow up visit at two months will include data collection on recurrence and
      presence of ocular infection. Evaluations for trichiasis recurrence will occur again at six
      months and at one year post-surgery. The latter visit will also include data collection on
      presence of ocular infection in the surgical case, and ocular infection in household
      members. Evaluation of the risk of recurrence at six months and one, two, and three years
      within each group will be completed to determine the benefit of using azithromycin compared
      to topical tetracycline, and the added benefit of family-based treatment.
