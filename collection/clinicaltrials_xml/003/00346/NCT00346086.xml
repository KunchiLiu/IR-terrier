  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various chemical modifications of allergens have been attempted to enhance efficacy, improve
      safety, and foster compliance with IT. These approaches have been unsuccessful - in that the
      allergenicity and immunogenicity have either decreased, or increased in tandem, with no
      resultant efficacy: safety benefit ratio. This study utilizes an adjuvant approach in which
      synthetic immunostimulatory DNA is conjugated to ragweed allergen in an attempt to modulate
      both the clinical and immunologic allergic response to ragweed exposure in ragweed-allergic
      patients with seasonal rhinitis.

    <textblock>
      Evaluation of efficacy and safety of allergen-CpG oligonucleotide immunostimulatory
      conjugate in treatment of ragweed-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis. Study incorporates
      clinical outcomes (symptom diaries, medication diaries, visual analog scores, quality of
      life questionnaires), safety measurements, immunologic assays (antibody measurements, T-cell
      assays, cytokine assays, nasal provocation).
