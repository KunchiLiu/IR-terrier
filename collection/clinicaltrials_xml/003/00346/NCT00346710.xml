      Rheumatology Clinic at Good Samaritan Hospital. We want to learn about the patient, his or

      The current study will evaluate the effect of offering a series of workshops to enhance
      communication skills on both patient and provider satisfaction. Participants will be
      patients seen in the Fellows Longitudinal Clinic of Johns Hopkins Rheumatology at Good
      Samaritan Hospital. All fellows currently enrolled in the Division of Rheumatology Training
      program will participate. (This study has been underwritten by the American College of
      Rheumatology as part of a fellowship awarded to the PI.)
