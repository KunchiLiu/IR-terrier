    <textblock>
      This is an 8 week study that compares two medications. One medication is olanzapine (5-20 mg
      daily) whereas the other medication is an orally disintegrating medication. Both medications
      are used to treat depressed bipolar patients. The main focus of this study is the comparison
      of these two medications on gastro-intestinal hormones and weight gain.

    <textblock>
      Olanzapine is undeniably one of the most effective treatments available for all phases of
      bipolar disorder. After FDA approval for bipolar mania, the drug became one of the most
      widely prescribed of treatments for this difficult-to-treat disorder. However, concerns
      about weight gain and the associated metabolic syndrome/type II diabetes have impacted the
      use of olanzapine.

      In fact, weight gain is quite common with olanzapine. For example, in one large scale 8-week
      placebo-controlled trial of olanzapine in bipolar depression, the olanzapine-treated
      patients gained an average of 2.59 kg., while placebo patients lost an average of 0.47 kg.
      Further, weight gain can continue over an extended period of time, mounting to an average of
      about 6 kg. over one year. It should be noted, however, that in prior studies, no efforts
      have been made to limit weight gain. More recent data suggest that interventions such as
      dietary counseling are effective in either preventing or reversing weight gain.

      Olanzapine is a potent antagonist of serotonin (5-HT) 2A, 5-HT2C, and histamine (H) 1
      receptors. Significant and potentially additive weight gain is associated with blockade of
      5-HT2C and H1 receptors. In addition, serotonin and its receptors are significantly involved
      in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) - related hormone secretion. Animal studies
      suggest significant involvement of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors in
      the regulation of appetite, satiety, and GI-related hormones. However, the interplay of
      selective activation or inhibition of these receptor subtypes is complex, and difficult to
      distinguish from effects on activity and anxiety. Suffice it to say that activation or
      blockade of these receptors have differential effects on appetite, satiety, metabolic
      activity, as well as leptin, secretin, insulin, glucagon, ghrelin, neuropeptide Y, and
      cholecystokinin.

      Weight gain and the corresponding metabolic syndrome represent a &quot;deal killer&quot; with regard
      to the treatment of most patients. However, one recent small study may be highly relevant to
      this discussion. De Haan et al.28 investigated the relative effects of standard olanzapine
      tablets to the orally-disintegrating form (ZydisTM) in adolescents and young adults who had
      gained weight with olanzapine. The group randomly assigned 18 patients to continuation
      olanzapine tablets or ZydisTM for a 16-week period. The ZydisTM-treated patients lost an
      average of 6.6 kg. while the continuation regular olanzapine group gained 3.7 kg. Although
      small, this study suggests a potential solution to the weight-gain problem associated with
      olanzapine.

      Most of the pharmacological effects on weight and hormones are thought to be mediated
      centrally. However, De Haan et al. (de Haan L, et al. Psychopharmacology (Berl).
      2004;175:389-390) proposed that at least some of the difference could be attributable to
      local effects in the GI tract. In particular, the site of absorption was suggested as a
      possible explanation, with the orally disintegrating form (ZydisTM) yielding less exposure
      of the pylorus to olanzapine than the standard ZyprexaTM tablets. 5-HT2 receptors may play a
      role in satiety and appetite via contraction of the duodenum. As well, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3
      receptors have been shown to mediate the release of secretin and pancreatic secretion of
      fluid and bicarbonate secondary to acidification of the duodenum (i.e., gastric emptying).
      This effect may be mediated via peripheral activation of 5-HT2A receptors.

      In this project we will treat 20 patients with bipolar disorder with olanzapine (a
      widely-used and FDA approved treatment for this condition); patients will be randomly
      assigned (1:1) to either standard Zyprexa tablets or orally disintegrating Zydis. We will
      measure symptom improvement and weight gain over the course of the study. Patients will be
      given dietary counseling prior to initiating either medication. In addition, we will
      contrast the effects of the treatments on GI-related hormones.
