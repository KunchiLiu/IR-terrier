  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether aspirin and simvastatin are safe and
      effective for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAH is characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and lower extremity edema as a result of heart
      failure. In PAH, in situ thrombosis may occur in the lungs, and pulmonary endothelial
      dysfunction is well-recognized. As aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation, there may be value
      in using aspirin to treat PAH. Simvastatin has beneficial effects on blood vessels in other
      types of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, simvastatin may similarly benefit patients with
      PAH.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive 6 months of daily placebo
      tablets, daily aspirin and daily placebo, daily simvastatin and daily placebo, or daily
      aspirin and daily simvastatin in a double-blind fashion. The study will compare the safety
      and efficacy of aspirin to placebo and simvastatin to placebo.
