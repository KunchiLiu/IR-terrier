      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving erlotinib before surgery may make the tumor smaller and
      reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving erlotinib after surgery
      may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well erlotinib works when given before and
      after surgery in treating patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of neoadjuvant erlotinib hydrochloride on histopathological,
           molecular, and genetic correlates in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for
           muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pathological complete response rate in surgical specimens from patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine recurrence and progression rates after cystectomy (up to 2 years after
           surgery) in patients treated with neoadjuvant and adjuvant erlotinib hydrochloride.

        -  Determine 2- and 5-year disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival rates in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily for 4 weeks. Patients then undergo
      radical cystectomy with curative intent. Within 12 weeks after surgery, patients resume oral
      erlotinib hydrochloride* once daily for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients who are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g., found to have pT3, N+
      disease) do not receive erlotinib hydrochloride after surgery.

      Tumor tissue is obtained at baseline (at the original or confirmatory transurethral
      resection of the bladder tumor) and at the time of cystectomy for analysis of drug-specific
      and tissue-based biomarkers by western blot, immunohistochemistry, and gene array
      techniques. Histopathological, molecular, and genetic correlates are analyzed to better
      understand the potential effects of EGFR inhibition in transitional cell carcinoma and to
      determine the effect of neoadjuvant erlotinib on gene expression. Tumor tissue is also
      evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction to confirm drug effects on expected targets
      and on EGFR expression, activity, and affected signaling pathways in the disease state and
      by microarray analysis to define expression phenotypes correlating with outcome, distinguish
      responders from nonresponders, and determine effects of drug treatment on gene expression in
      disease.

      Patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years after surgery.
