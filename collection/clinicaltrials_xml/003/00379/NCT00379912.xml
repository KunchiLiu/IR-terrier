    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to explore a modified dose and schedule of azacitidine in order to
      more effectively address the needs of patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes
      (MDS), i.e., to alter the natural history of the disease without excessive toxicity or
      burden. The administration of erythropoietin is designed to influence the differentiation of
      primitive hematopoietic cells in which azacitidine has reversed the abnormal phenotype to
      red blood cells for patients in whom inadequate production of red blood cells is the major
      clinical issue.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multi-center, randomized study.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms:

      Arm A (Azacitidine + Erythropoietin)

        -  Azacitidine Treatment 50 mg/m2 subcutaneously every other day (three times a week) for
           two consecutive weeks every four weeks. A cycle of therapy is defined as two
           consecutive weeks of subcutaneous azacitidine administered every other day three times
           a week (e.g. Monday - Wednesday - Friday) and the time to resolution of any treatment
           associated toxicity.

        -  Erythropoietin Treatment Patients who are randomized to Arm A will receive a dose of
           60,000IU as a single subcutaneous injection weekly without interruption while enrolled
           on protocol therapy. The dose should be administered to coincide with the first day of
           each cycle.

        -  Protocol therapy may be administered for up to six cycles of therapy.

      Arm B (Azacitidine Alone)

        -  Azacitidine Treatment 50 mg/m2 subcutaneously every other day (three times a week) for
           two consecutive weeks every four weeks. A cycle of therapy is defined as two
           consecutive weeks of subcutaneous azacitidine administered every other day three times
           a week (e.g. Monday - Wednesday - Friday) and the time to resolution of any treatment
           associated toxicity.

        -  Protocol therapy may be administered for up to six cycles of therapy.

      ECOG performance status 0 to 2

      Hematopoietic:

      To be eligible for randomization, subjects must have documentation of at least 1 of the
      following:

           transfusion within a period of 8 weeks).

        -  An untransfused hemoglobin &lt; 10 gm/dl measured on at least two occasions more than 7

          -  Females with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to being randomized. Patients are considered not of child bearing potential if
