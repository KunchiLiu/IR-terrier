      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as trabectedin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well trabectedin works in treating patients
      with advanced, persistent, or recurrent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of trabectedin, as measured by frequency and duration
           of objective response, in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent uterine
           leiomyosarcoma.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive trabectedin IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a
      confirmed complete response may receive at least 2 additional courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
