    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Naltrexone may fight breast
      cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Naltrexone may also stop the
      growth of breast cancer by impairing blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well naltrexone works in treating women with
      metastatic breast cancer that is no longer responsive to previous hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of naltrexone in women with hormone-refractory, metastatic
           breast cancer as measured by serial fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission
           tomography-CT scans.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of naltrexone in these patients.

        -  Determine the median time to event (first time when maximum specific uptake values is
           higher than that at baseline) within 1 year of study entry.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral naltrexone once daily for 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 8 weeks, patients may continue naltrexone off
      study at the discretion of the physician.

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-CT scans at baseline,
      week 4, week 8, and periodically thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic, hormone-receptor positive breast cancer

          -  Disease that has progressed despite previous systemic hormonal therapy. Hormone
             therapy must be terminated at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment.

          -  Prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy is allowed if at least 3
             weeks since last treatment. Patient must recover from the acute toxic effects of the
             treatment prior to study enrollment.
