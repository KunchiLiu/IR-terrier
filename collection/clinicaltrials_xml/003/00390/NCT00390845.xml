                  is evidence of loss of large and small fibre function (confirmed by an
                  electrophysiological nerve conduction examination and by quantitative sensory
                  testing - warm sensation &gt; 5.2 0C and cool sensation &gt; 4.5 0C - in median nerve
                  territory (Anand et al., unpublished data).

               -  location of pain consistent with the area innervated by the affected nerve(s),
                  with or without other sensory symptoms in the affected area

             examination, laboratory assessment or ECG at screening which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could interfere with the interpretation of efficacy or safety data or
             which otherwise would contraindicate participation in a clinical study, in
             particular:

               -  subjects with non-neuropathic pain component involvement, mononeuropathy
                  multiplex, or more than one cause or potential cause for pain symptoms (e.g.

                  C nucleic acid result;

               -  GI disorders that may interfere with safety assessments, e.g. diarrhoea.

          -  Recent start or change in dosing regimen (£1 month prior to screen) of any medication
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with pain assessments or
             introduce a risk of drug-drug interactions (e.g. glucocorticoids and some
             anticonvulsants, see Section 9.2, Prohibited Medications for details).

          -  Unable to refrain from excessive use medications (e.g. sedatives) that in the opinion

             females.

          -  Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice within seven days prior to the first
             dose of study medication.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within a 30-day period prior to dosing.

          -  Participation in a trial with any drug within 3 months before the start of the study
