  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify genes and proteins responsible for specific muscle
      disorders by studying genetic material from individuals with neuromuscular disease, as well
      as their family members. We are interested in recruiting many types of neuromuscular disease
      including; Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy DMD/BMD, limb-girdle muscle dystrophy
      LGMD. There are still many patients diagnosed with muscular dystrophy but have no causative
      gene implicated in their disease. We feel that these patients may have new genetic changes
      in genes coding for important muscle proteins that we have yet to identify. Using molecular
      genetics to unravel the biochemical basis of these neuromuscular disorders should lead to
      more accurate diagnosis of these disorders and should lead to potential therapies.

      Our research has many goals, one of which is to characterize the genetic changes responsible
      for the type of muscle disease found in our participants. In our past research, several new
      genes responsible for various forms of neuromuscular disease were identified and/or are
      being studied. These include dystrophin, the sarcoglycans, obscurin, and filamin. Each
      discovery has resulted in advances in our ability to develop diagnostic tests which benefit
      patients and their families by providing accurate diagnosis, presymptomatic and/or prenatal
      testing. Genotype-phenotype correlation studies have increased our understanding of the
      natural history of these rare disorders benefiting patients through better prognostic
      determinations by clinicians. Biochemical and pathological analysis of muscle biopsies has
      led to new insights into disease pathophysiology which we hope will aid in finding
      treatments.

      Our research also studies gene expression in muscle biopsy samples. This entails identifying
      the genes whose expression is increased or decreased in the muscles of individuals with
      different muscular dystrophy types. We believe these studies will identify genes and gene
      pathways which are common to the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy or which are unique to a
      particular dystrophy. Our microarray research should lead to a better understanding of the
      disease process and possible ways to halt the process. The end point of these studies would
      be an accurate description of the disease pathogenesis.
