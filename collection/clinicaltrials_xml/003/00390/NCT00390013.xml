      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate if the medication gabapentin lessens the
      vulvar pain some women experience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is not a &quot;best&quot; treatment plan for vulvar pain including vulvodynia (chronic vulvar
      pain) and vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (VVS, chronic vulvar pain localized to the vaginal
      opening). We propose that vulvodynia is a neuropathic pain (pain that effects the nervous
      system) as characterized by pain from stimuli that is not usually painful, stimuli that
      would not usually be painful causing significant pain, and burning pain. Gabapentin has been
      shown to be effective in treating chronic pain.
