  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyaluronan is a man-made preparation of a protein complex that occurs naturally in joints
      and that is often low in people with osteoarthritis. Although hyaluronan has been used in
      millions of people with knee osteoarthritis, it is not yet FDA approved for use in the
      thumb. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of hyaluronan
      in relieving arthritis symptoms at the base of the thumb and to compare it to
      corticosteroids and local anesthetic.

      The principle hypothesis is that treating osteoarthritis at the carpometacarpophalangeal
      (CMC) joint with injectable hyaluronan will results in greater pain relief, higher patient
      satisfaction, and better functional outcomes than treating with placebo injections (local
      anesthetic) or with corticosteroid injections. Treating CMC osteoarthritis with
      corticosteroid injections will result in greater pain relief, higher patient satisfaction,
      and better functional outcomes than treating with placebo injections. Patients with worse
      pre-treatment function will have less improvement and worse post-treatment results after
      administration of corticosteroid or hyaluronan.

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis involves a wearing down of the cartilage within a joint. It can affect any
      joint in the body, but it most commonly affects joints in the hands, hips, knees, and spine.
      Over the last few years, a new medicine called hyaluronan has been used for treating
      osteoarthritis. Hyaluronan is a man-made preparation of a protein complex that occurs
      naturally in joints and that is often low in people with osteoarthritis. Although hyaluronan
      has been used in millions of people with knee osteoarthritis, it is not yet FDA approved for
      use in the thumb. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of
      hyaluronan in relieving arthritis symptoms at the base of the thumb and to compare it to
      corticosteroids and local anesthetic. Specifically, the study will evaluate pain relief,
      patient satisfaction, and functional outcomes among participants.

      Participation in this study will last 26 weeks. Screening will include a questionnaire and
      an x-ray of the affected thumb. Eligible participants will then be randomly assigned to one
      of three treatments: two hyaluronan injections, one corticosteroid injection plus one local
      anesthetic injection, or two local anesthetic injections. Participants will receive the
      injections at the base of their thumb, and the first injection will be followed by the
      second injection a week later. There will be five study visits that will occur at baseline
      and Weeks 2, 4, 12, and 26. All study visits will include questionnaires, and except for the
      Week 2 study visit, they will also include an examination and evaluation of the affected
      thumb. Photographs of the thumb will be taken at baseline. The injections will occur at
      baseline and Week 2. At Weeks 8 and 20, questionnaires will be mailed to participants for
      them to complete. Upon completing the study, participants will have the option of receiving
      continued treatment with another round of hyaluronic injections.
