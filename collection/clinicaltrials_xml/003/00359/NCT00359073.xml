    <textblock>
      People with asthma may have asthma worsening when they have an upper respiratory infection
      due to a virus or a common cold. Leukotrienes are increased in nasal secretions from
      children with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and lung washings during times of acute lung
      inflammation. Experimental virus exposure in adults is also associated with increases in
      nasal leukotrienes.

      The degree to which leukotrienes play a role in asthma worsening is unknown.There is
      information linking leukotrienes to viral infections, allergic inflammation, and asthma
      exacerbation.This information supports the hypothesis that virus-induced leukotrienes
      contribute to the severity of respiratory infections and in susceptible individuals, lead to
      lower airway obstruction and exacerbations of asthma. We propose to use montelukast in an
      experimental viral challenge model to explore this hypothesis.

      Viral infections are important causes of wheezing illnesses throughout childhood and in
      adults with asthma. There has been progress in identifying mechanisms and risk factors for
      severe respiratory symptoms, and in particular, wheezing. Given this close relationship, it
      would be attractive to apply antiviral strategies to the prevention and treatment of asthma,
      and both RV and RSV are obvious targets. Unfortunately, attempts at developing an RSV
      vaccine have so far been unsuccessful, and vaccination to prevent RV infection does not seem
      to be feasible due to the large number of serotypes. Antiviral medications have been tested
      in clinical trials,53-57 however one problem with this approach is that once the clinical
      signs and symptoms appear, viral replication is well underway. As a result, reductions in
      respiratory symptoms or the duration of illness are modest.56 The other potential
      therapeutic approach for respiratory viral infections would be to selectively inhibit
      pro-inflammatory immune responses induced by the virus. The beneficial effects of systemic
      glucocorticoids indicate that this approach is valid; the challenge will be to develop
      treatments with greater efficacy and a reduced potential for adverse effects. The large body
      of information linking cysteinyl leukotrienes to viral infections, allergic inflammation,
      and asthma exacerbations, strongly supports the hypothesis that virus-induced leukotrienes
      contribute to the severity of respiratory infections and in susceptible individuals, lead to
      lower airway obstruction and exacerbations of asthma. We propose to use montelukast in an
      experimental viral challenge model to explore this hypothesis.
