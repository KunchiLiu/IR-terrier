      The main purpose of this study is to compare how one 50mg tablet of SB-497115 is broken down
      in the body by healthy subjects versus subjects with mild, moderate or severe liver
      problems. The study is also being done to 1) check on how well the study drug is tolerated
      by healthy subjects versus those with liver problems and 2) to check if liver impairment
      affects how the study drug binds to protein in the blood.
