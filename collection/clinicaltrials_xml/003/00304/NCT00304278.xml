      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of treatment with
      Tarceva (Erlotinib) and RADPLAT (RADiation and intraarterial cisPLATin) for patients with
      Head and Neck cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck malignancies represent a group of epidermoid tumors that arise from the
      epithelial lining of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. Three modalities of therapy have
      established roles in the treatment of carcinoma of the head and neck: chemotherapy,
      radiation therapy (XRT), and surgery. The choice of modality depends upon many factors such
      as the site and extent of the primary lesion, the likelihood of complete surgical resection,
      the presence of lymph node metastases, etc. Traditionally, smaller lesions (stage T1-T2) are
      effectively treated either, by surgical excision or irradiation whereas more advanced
      disease (stage III-IV) is treated with combined surgery and XRT. The subsequent morbidity
      related to extensive surgery is a major problem among survivors. Clearly, there is a need to
      develop therapeutic strategies for patients with advanced head and neck cancer with more
      effective approaches employing non-surgical modalities.

      Our hypothesis is that head and neck cancers are resistant to apoptosis from DNA damage
      induced by radiation and chemotherapy. This resistance is mediated by EGFR overexpression
      which results in downstream activation of cell survival signals, such as AKT, and may be
      overcome when Erlotinib (Tarceva) is co-administered with RADiation and cisPLATin
      (intraarterial chemotherapy).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage III-IV disease
             comprised of T3 or T4 N0-2 lesions of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and
             larynx.

          -  No previous radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

          -  No evidence of distant metastatic disease.

          -  Age &gt; 18.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60 (ECOG 2).

          -  ANC &gt; 1000, platelets &gt; 100,000, calculated or 24-hour creatinine clearance &gt; 60.

          -  Study-specific informed consent form.

          -  Protocol treatment must begin &lt; 8 weeks of diagnostic biopsy.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  Patients with surgically cured secondary malignancy who have been disease free &gt; 5
             years are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiologic evidence of bone destruction.

          -  Previous or concurrent head and neck primaries.

          -  Prior surgery to study site other than biopsy.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because treatments and agents have the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. For this reason, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  History of a prior or concomitant malignancy (other than carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin).
