  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III clinical trial is studying how well cisplatin-based chemotherapy and/or
      surgery works in treating young patients with stage I, stage II, stage III or stage IV
      adrenocortical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.
      Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of
      normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving it after surgery may kill any tumor cells
      that remain after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the outcome of patients with stage I adrenocortical tumor (ACT) treated with
      surgery alone.

      II. Describe the outcome of patients with stage II ACT treated with radical adrenalectomy
      plus regional retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.

      III. Describe the outcome of patients with unresectable or metastatic ACT treated with
      mitotane and a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility and complications associated with the use of radical
      adrenalectomy and regional node dissection (RLND) in these patients.

      II. Determine the toxicity of mitotane when administered with cisplatin, etoposide, and
      doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with residual disease after surgery, inoperable
      tumors, or metastatic disease at diagnosis.

      III. Determine, prospectively, the frequency of tumor spillage during surgery in these
      patients.

      IV. Determine the frequency of lymph node involvement in these patients. V. Compare the
      incidence and type of germline p53 mutation in non-Brazilian children and children from
      Southern Brazil.

      VI. Characterize the cooperating molecular alterations associated with ACT. VII. Determine
      the presence of embryonal markers in children with ACT.

      OUTLINE:

      STRATUM I (stage I disease): Patients undergo primary tumor resection and retroperitoneal
      lymph node sampling followed by observation. Patients who have undergone prior surgery
      without nodal sampling undergo observation only.

      STRATUM II (stage II disease): Patients undergo primary tumor resection and extended
      regional lymph node dissection followed by observation. Patients who have undergone prior
      surgery with simple resection of the primary tumor undergo exploratory surgery with extended
      regional lymph node dissection followed by observation.

      STRATUM III (stage III or IV disease):

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy comprising oral
      mitotane four times daily on days 1-21; cisplatin IV over 6 hours on days 1-2; etoposide IV
      over 1 hour on days 1-3; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 4-5. Patients
      also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 6 and
      continuing until blood counts recover OR pegfilgrastim SC once on day 6. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 2-4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with stable disease or partial response proceed to surgery. Patients with
      a complete response proceed directly to continuation chemotherapy.

      SURGERY: Patients with stage III disease undergo extended surgery and regional lymph node
      dissection. Patients with stage IV disease undergo primary tumor resection (if feasible)
      with regional lymph node dissection and resection of the metastases. Patients then proceed
      to continuation chemotherapy.

      CONTINUATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive additional cisplatin-based chemotherapy (as in
      induction chemotherapy) for 4-6 courses followed by mitotane alone for an additional 2
      months. Patients with stage IV disease then proceed to additional surgery when feasible.

      ADDITIONAL SURGEY: Patients with stage IV disease may undergo additional primary tumor
      resection with regional lymph node dissection and resection (or re-resection) of the
      metastases.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 5
      years.

    <description>The model used for comparison will be an exponential model with a constant failure rate of 0.053 (stratum I), 0.347 (stratum II), 0.602 (stratum III and IV) per year for the first two years and 0 after that. The one-sample one-sided log-rank test comparing the observed data with the hypothesized model (Woolson, 1981) of size 0.05 will be used to assess whether the data are consistent with the target models. Since this test has independent increments, the method of Lan and DeMets will be used to derive the p-values for testing procedure.</description>
