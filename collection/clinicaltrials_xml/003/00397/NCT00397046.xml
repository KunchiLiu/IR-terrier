    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of HKI-272, and to
      determine the maximum dose that can safety be given. The secondary purpose of this study is
      to determine how the body uses and gets rid of HKI-272 and to assess whether HKI-272 is
      effective for the treatment of advanced solid tumors.

      This is a phase 1 open-label sequential-group study of ascending single and multiple oral
      doses administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors. Each subject will participate in
      only 1 dose group and will receive a single dose of test article, followed by a 1-week
      observation period, and then will receive the test article administered once-daily by mouth
      in cycles consisting of 28 days. Subjects will be enrolled in groups of 3 to 6. Adverse
      events and dose-limiting toxicities will be assessed from the first single dose.
