      This study is intended to help develop new MRI imaging techniques for studying mood and
      anxiety disorders. Researchers believe that depression and anxiety disorders may cause
      structural and functional changes in the brain. This study will optimize the way MRI scans
      are collected to look at brain structure and examine how the brain behaves while subjects
      perform particular tasks.

      Healthy normal subjects between 18 and 50 years of age who have never had a major
      psychiatric disorder and who have no first-degree relatives with mood disorders may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened by phone with questions about their
      psychiatric and medical history, current emotional state and sleep pattern, and family
      history of psychiatric disorders. Candidates who pass the preliminary screening then undergo
      additional screening interviews and laboratory tests.

      Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing, as
      follows:

      &quot;&lt;TAB&gt;MRI scans: Subjects are asked to participate in an MRI study on one of several
      scanners to measure blood flow in the brain, concentrations of certain chemicals in the
      brain, or magnetic properties of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnet and radio waves to
      obtain pictures of the brain. The subject lies still on a narrow bed with a metal coil close
      to the head. For this study, subjects may be asked to wear a special coil on the neck to
      help measure blood flow. They may be asked to watch a screen presenting images or to do a
      task in which they respond to pictures or sounds and may be asked to return for additional
      scans.

      &quot;&lt;TAB&gt;Neuropsychological testing: Subjects may undergo tests of cognitive performance.
      Often, people with mood disorders have subtle changes in performance on these tests that
      allow researchers to pinpoint where brain abnormalities occur. Before the tests can be used
      in patients, they must be validated by using healthy subjects. These tests are presented
      either orally, in written form, or on a computer.

    <textblock>
      A major component of understanding the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety disorders is
      expected to involve elucidation of abnormalities of brain structure and function associated
      with these conditions. Historically, post-mortem histopathological and neurochemical
      assessments constituted the primary methods for investigating abnormalities of brain
      structure and function in psychiatric disorders. However, the significance of the results
      from such studies has been limited by the relatively poor availability of specimens from
      subjects with mood and anxiety disorders who had been unmedicated and clinically
      well-characterized antemortem. By allowing for in vivo human studies, medical imaging
      technologies afford efficient, accurate, and non-invasive alternatives for characterizing
      brain structure and function. The recent, rapid development of magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) technology, in particular, has provided powerful tools for assessing a wide range of
      cerebral physiological and morphological characteristics. To optimally exploit the potential
      of rapidly evolving MRI capabilities and hardware in investigations of mood and anxiety
      disorders, new techniques and applications must be tested and developed. The technical
      development protocol proposed herein will assess new imaging techniques and hardware, and
      will develop novel cognitive tasks for application in the study of mood and anxiety
      disorders.

      The primary objective of this protocol is the development of MRI experiments for
      characterizing the physiological correlates of mood and anxiety disorders. In addition, the
      pilot projects encompassed within this protocol involve the optimization of existing MRI
      pulse sequences, the application of new pulse sequences for structural and functional MR
      imaging, and the development of new functional MRI (fMRI) tasks that can elucidate neural
      function within the cognitive-behavioral domains affected in mood and anxiety disorders.
      This protocol will also allow testing of newly developed imaging hardware that can increase
      the spatial resolution, contrast, and sensitivity of MR images. Such hardware includes the
      implementation of new radio frequency (RF) coils and patient monitoring equipment.
      Development of these techniques and applications will directly enhance the sensitivity and
      specificity of MRI studies of mood and anxiety disorders.
