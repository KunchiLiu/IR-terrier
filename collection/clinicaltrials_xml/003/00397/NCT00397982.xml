  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving temsirolimus together with bevacizumab works
      in treating patients with stage III or stage IV malignant melanoma. Temsirolimus may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of
      malignant melanoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving temsirolimus together with
      bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective tumor response rate (complete response and partial response) in
      patients with stage III or IV melanoma treated with temsirolimus and bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the
      efficacy of this regimen, in terms of progression-free survival, in these patients.

      III. Compare pre- vs post-treatment measurements of biomarkers and vascular system/immune
      system parameters in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Correlate tumor and blood biomarkers with clinical response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats every 14 days for a maximum of
      26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo
      tumor resection on day 9 of course 2.Blood samples are collected during courses 1 and 2.
      Samples are examined by flow cytometry to evaluate peripheral blood mononuclear cells for
      molecular effects of study agents. Patients also undergo normal and tumor tissue biopsy (by
      core needle biopsy, incisional biopsy, or surgical resection) during courses 1 and 2.
      Samples are examined by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, protein array technology,
      gene expression analyses, DNA mutation analyses, and genomic analyses for pre-and
      post-treatment measurements of target molecules (epidermal growth factor receptor, B-Raf,
      MEK, MAPK), downstream pathway components (PI-3 kinase, AKT, mTOR), markers of angiogenesis,
      proliferation and apoptosis, markers that may modulate cell signaling or the response to
      investigational agents, and vascular and immune system parameters.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for up
      to 2 years, and then periodically for up to 5 years.
