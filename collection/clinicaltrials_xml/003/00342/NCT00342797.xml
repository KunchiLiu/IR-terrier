  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A series of 1,729 retinoblastoma (RB) patients were identified from medical records at
      hospital centers in Boston (1937-84) and New York (1914-84). The study cohort consists of
      the 1,604 patients who survived at least 1 year after RB diagnosis. Information was obtained
      from medical records and interviews conducted in 1987 and 1993. RB patients had a 30-fold
      excess risk of another cancer, and a 50% chance of developing a cancer if they survived to
      50 years of age. Blood samples have been collected from 481 patients, and studies are
      underway to determine if certain mutations in the RB1 genes are associated with increased or
      decreased penetrance or with increased risk of subsequent cancer development. The study
      population in New York is being expanded currently to include patients treated since 1984,
      and their medical records are being abstracted. Blood samples will be collected from the
      newly identified patients who are returning to New York Hospital for a followup RB exam.
