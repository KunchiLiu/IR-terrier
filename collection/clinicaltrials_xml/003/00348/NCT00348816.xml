      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and prednisone, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Docetaxel may make
      tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving docetaxel together with radiation
      therapy and prednisone after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with radiation
      therapy and prednisone works in treating patients who have undergone surgery for prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline and the number of
           patients reaching a PSA nadir of zero after treatment with chemoradiotherapy comprising
           docetaxel and external-beam radiotherapy followed by docetaxel and prednisone in
           patients with hormone-naive prostate cancer who have a persistent or rising PSA after
           radical prostatectomy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival, based on PSA progression, of these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with chemoradiotherapy for rising
           PSA after radical prostatectomy.

        -  Determine if the velocity of subsequent PSA failure impacts survival of these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  Document subsequent therapy for patients whose previous treatment has failed and if
           there is a response to that therapy.

      Quaternary: To collect data on a contemporary cohort to those on study that received
      radiation alone. We will match cancer and patient characteristics to determine if the
      variable of chemotherapy has any impact on outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 and
      undergo external-beam radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47.

      Beginning within 6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive docetaxel
      IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral prednisone twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, every 4 months for 2
      years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
