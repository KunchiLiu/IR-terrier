  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the effectiveness of KASA (Kaletra Patient Support Program) on
      improving or maintaining treatment adherence in HIV positive patients that have been
      initiated on treatment with Kaletra®. This will be a purely observational study conducted on
      patients that will be on treatment with Kaletra®. All treatments will be as per routine care
      including the use of KASA which will be determined exclusively by the physician and the
      patient without consideration of the study.

      The efficacy of disease management programs as assessed in randomized clinical trials is not
      representative of real - life effectiveness observed under routine clinical practice. In
      real - life settings the utilization of and compliance with disease management programs by
      physicians and patients is not uniform. Therefore assessment of their true effectiveness is
      ideally conducted under a pure observational setting without any interference from the
      investigators with respect to making the programs available to patients and enforcing their
      adherence to them.

      This is a 12-month, multi-center, Canadian Post Marketing Observational Study utilizing a
      prospective single cohort design. Patients that are treated with Kaletra® including those
      that are initiated on treatment with Kaletra® will be eligible to participate. All
      treatments including participation in the KASA (Kaletra Adherence Support Assistance)
      program will be according to the decision of the treating physician and the patients and
      will not be affected in any way by their decision to participate in the study. Follow-up
      will be for 12 months with visits conducted according to the physician judgment. However,
      assessments every six months will be recommended.
