  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib, dose-escalation and cohort-expansion study of
      atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) in combination with vemurafenib or vemurafenib plus
      cobimetinib in participants with BRAFV600-mutation positive metastatic melanoma. Enrolled
      participants may continue treatment until they are no longer experiencing clinical benefit
      as assessed by the investigator and in alignment with the protocol.
