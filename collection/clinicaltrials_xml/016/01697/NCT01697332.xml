  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of our study are to determine the capabilities of hyperpolarized
      129Xe MRI to measure lung function and its potential to sensitively detect pulmonary disease
      and its progression in COPD. We hypothesize that measurement of alveolar surface area,
      septal thickness, and capillary transit time measured with hyperpolarized 129Xe will
      correlate better with quality of life measures in COPD subjects than traditional diagnostic
      measures such as spirometry and Computed Tomography.

    <description>Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI scans will be performed on healthy subjects and the uptake of 129Xe in the pulmonary septal tissue will be measured as a function of time. From this data, the mean and distribution of three pulmonary functional parameters will be determined. The three measures are alveolar surface area per unit volume, septal thickness and capillary transit time through the gas exchange region.</description>

    <description>Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI measures of disease severity in GOLD Stage 1-3 subjects are more highly correlated with physical disabilities associated with their pulmonary disease than traditional tests of pulmonary function.</description>

    <description>Determine the degree to which the spatial heterogeneity of regional 129Xe measurements of pulmonary function in a single individual correlates with physical manifestations of disease severity. We hypothesize that measures of spatial heterogeneity will correlate highly with physical disability.</description>
