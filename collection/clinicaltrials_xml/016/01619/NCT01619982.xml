  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to learn 1) if the addition of prophylaxis with vancomycin will
      decrease the rate of cefazolin non-susceptible SSI's, in high risk population 2) to develop
      better understanding of vancomycin and cefazolin pharmacokinetics in children undergoing
      cardiopulmonary bypass 3) to assess the barriers to vancomycin dosing peri-operatively 4) to
      assess side effects and risks associated with peri-operative vancomycin administration. This
      will allow us to improve patient care by better understanding the benefits or the risks of
      peri-operative vancomycin administration and potentially decrease cefazolin-resistant
      surgical site infections.

      In addition, this study gives us the opportunity to evaluate cefazolin and vancomycin
      pharmacokinetics on children on CPB.

      The investigators will take blood samples from 20 patients. In 10 patients the investigators
      will do Cefazolin pK analysis and in the other 10 the investigators will do pK Vancomycin
      analysis. For the remainder of 292 patients, only prospective chart review will be done to
      determine the incidence of SSI's.

      This data will be compared with 936 controls who received only Cefazolin pre-operatively as
      prophylaxis for SSI's.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With 100% compliance with the surgical infection prevention (SIP) bundle, the risk of
      surgical site infections (SSIs) has decreased considerably, but is still greater than the
      baseline rate at the best comparison hospital (2.5%). Recent analysis of SSI's in
      cardiovascular surgery patients identified more than half being caused by cefazolin
      resistant gram positive bacteria (methicillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococci-
      MRSE, or methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus- MRSA). Cefazolin is routinely given
      pre-operatively as surgical prophylaxis in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery.

      Vancomycin is not routinely recommended for prophylaxis due to concerns of developing
      vancomycin resistance, however patients with MRSE and MRSA SSIs end up needing additional
      surgery to remove or replace infected hardware or grafts and/or additional weeks to months
      of intravenous vancomycin therapy. This results in significant morbidity to the children and
      cost to the institution. Several published guidelines suggest the use of pre-operative
      prophylaxis with vancomycin (alone or in conjunction with cefazolin) in instances where
      patients may be at higher risk for infection with MRSE or MRSA. The purpose of this study is
      to determine whether the addition of vancomycin to standard pre-operative prophylaxis with
      cefazolin in selected high risk subjects along with the full SIP bundle will decrease the
      incidence of cefazolin-resistant SSI's.
