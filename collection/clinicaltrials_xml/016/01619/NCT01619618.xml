      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related
      to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers in samples from patients with
      recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer treated on ECOG-E1302 trial.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the frequency of ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 2
           (ABCG2), met proto-oncogene (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) (c-MET), and v-Ki-ras2
           Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-ras) polymorphisms or mutations in this
           study population and the predictiveness of these polymorphisms on survival, time to
           progression, response rate, and toxicities.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells are analyzed for the
      frequency of ABCG2, c-MET, and K-ras polymorphisms or mutations by polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR). Results are then correlated with patients' clinical outcomes and toxicity.
