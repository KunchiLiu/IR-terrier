               -  Hypothyroidism

             of the study, including progressive cervical medullary compression

          -  Growth plates have fused

          -  Have a history of any of the following:

               -  Renal insufficiency

          -  Cardiac or vascular disease, including the following:

               -  Cardiac dysfunction (abnormal echocardiogram [ECHO] including left ventricle
                  [LV] mass) at Screening Visit

               -  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

               -  Congenital heart disease

               -  Cerebrovascular disease, aortic insufficiency

               -  Clinically significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmias

          -  Current treatment with antihypertensive medications, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II
             receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, cardiac
             glycosides, systemic anticholinergic agents, any medication that may impair or
             enhance compensatory tachycardia, drugs known to alter renal function that is
             expected to continue for the duration of the study

          -  Have been treated with growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), or
             anabolic steroids in the previous 6 months or long-term treatment (&gt; 3 months) at any
             time

          -  Have had regular long-term treatment (&gt; 1 month) with oral corticosteroids (low-dose

          -  Have had bone-related surgery or expected to have bone-related surgery during the
             study period. Subjects with previous limb-lengthening surgery may enroll if surgery

             sequelae.

          -  Have any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at high
