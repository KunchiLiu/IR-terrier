  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether an intervention that involves the
      medication naltrexone, will reduce drinking and improve health outcomes in women with HIV
      infection and hazardous drinking. Our central hypotheses are that, compared to women who
      receive placebo (sugar pill containing no medicine), women who receive naltrexone will have
      decreased rates of hazardous drinking, improved HIV medication adherence, less rapid disease
      progression, and reduced sexual risk behavior. The study design will involve 240
      HIV-infected women with hazardous drinking, who will be recruited from HIV clinics,
      neighborhoods and referrals in Miami, Florida.

      Eligible women will receive either a daily pill containing naltrexone (50mg) or an
      identical-appearing placebo for four months. All participants will receive encouragement and
      feedback related to their drinking regardless of medication assignment. The study
      participants will be assessed at two, four and seven months after enrollment. The proposed
      work is innovative because pharmacologic treatment for alcohol has not been evaluated in
      HIV-infected women. If our hypotheses are confirmed, the study findings would transform the
      approach to hazardous drinking within clinics serving HIV-infected women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a
      treatment program for hazardous drinking, delivered within HIV-clinic outpatient settings,
      that involves oral naltrexone. The central hypothesis is that women participating in the
      treatment program will have decreased rates of hazardous drinking and improved clinical and
      behavioral health outcomes that are associated with hazardous drinking. The investigators
      have formulated this hypotheses based on the existing literature, the preliminary data and
      the clinical experience. The investigators theorize that women who receive an alcohol
      treatment intervention will be less likely to have &quot;at risk&quot; drinking behavior 6-months
      after enrollment, compared to women who received similar assessments but no formal treatment
      intervention. The investigators hypothesize that 4-months after enrollment, women who
      receive an alcohol treatment intervention will have improved adherence to HIV antiretroviral
      therapy, improved CD4 cell counts, reduced HIV viral load, and reduced risky sexual
      behavior, compared to women who receive similar assessments but no formal intervention.

      The investigators will recruit 240 women from one site in Miami, Florida. Of those 240 women
      120 will receive naltrexone and the others will receive placebo. Study participants will
      take the medication for 4 months but the investigators will follow them for 7 months. At
      baseline, 2 months, 4 months and 7 months, the investigators will administer study
      questionnaires and assess their liver enzymes, CD4 count and viral load. The investigators
      will also follow them up at months 1 and 3 to reinforce the medication intake and to assess
      for any possible side effects.

      New treatment options are available, but their impact on hazardous drinking has not yet been
      evaluated among HIV-infected women, many of whom are poor, minorities, or who have
      associated mental health or substance abuse problems. Delivery of therapeutic interventions
      must be improved in order to reduce hazardous drinking in women with HIV/AIDS. The proposed
      research is significant because the therapy will be offered within HIV clinic settings and
      will potentially improve the health of a population that is significantly undertreated. In
      addition to determining the effectiveness of an alcohol treatment intervention, the
      investigators will also identify key barriers and facilitators associated with adherence to
      pharmacologic treatment for alcohol in women with hazardous drinking. The findings will
      directly affect the type and quality of care for hazardous drinking in this subset of
      HIV-infected individuals and will inform both primary and secondary prevention efforts.
