  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether an aggressive quality improvement
      intervention strategy will decrease time from hospital presentation to first balloon
      inflation in non-transfer patients with acute ST segment elevation MI (STEMI) treated with
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Twelve hospitals in Michigan were
      randomized to either aggressive intervention or control. The intervention consisted of Grand
      Rounds at each hospital, sharing of best practices, and coordinating center staff working
      closely with staff at each intervention hospital to discuss solutions to barriers to rapid
      treatment for STEMI patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participating hospitals randomized to the aggressive intervention strategy actively
      worked to create teams to analyze processes of care for STEMI patients, identify areas
      needing improvement, and implemented strategies to streamline treatment.

      Hospitals randomized to control were instructed to conduct &quot;business as usual&quot;.

    <description>Hospitals were randomized to an aggressive intervention strategy or to &quot;business as usual&quot;. The hospitals randomized to the aggressive intervention strategy underwent the following:
Grand Rounds conducted by physician and nurse from the Coordinating Center. This included a formal presentation on the evidence supporting rapid time to treatment in STEMI patients and evidence based strategies for reducing treatment delays.
Discussion with staff regarding perceived barriers to treatment and suggestions/ideas for strategies to overcome these barriers
Follow-up monthly phone conferences to continue to discuss strategies and ideas sharing
Written plan from sites detailing plans to change processes of care.</description>
