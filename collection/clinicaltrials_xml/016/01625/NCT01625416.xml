  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After traumatic injuries some people have difficulty returning to the routine of their
      everyday activities and may experience physical and emotional pain. The purpose of this
      study is to identify new ways of providing support for physically injured trauma survivors.
      All study procedures are designed to work around patient needs and be as flexible as
      possible in order to best fit into patients' post-injury recovery.

      Patients who are eligible for the study are randomly assigned to receive care as usual, or
      the &quot;new method of treatment,&quot; with the study Trauma Support Specialist (TSS). This TSS will
      be in contact with the patient for the next three months; they may visit the patient at the
      hospital or at outpatient medical appointments. The TSS will also be available to talk with
      the patient over the telephone. Overall, the TSS will be working with the patient to help
      with difficulties returning to his or her routine and overcoming physical and emotional pain
      experienced after the injury. We believe that patients who receive the &quot;new method of
      treatment,&quot; will be more able to return to daily routines and/or cope with the emotional
      stress that can occur after an injury. Intervention technology innovations including mHealth
      applications and web-based links will be included in the investigation.

      Clinical feasibility randomized clinical trial (RCT) pilot of integrating information
      technology advancements into Early PTSD Screening and Intervention. Design Overview: Between
      30-200 injured trauma survivors who are initially admitted to either the Harborview
      inpatient wards or emergency department acute care settings will be enrolled in the study.
      If patients agree to participate, they will be engaged by a research assistant to complete a
      baseline assessment battery. Following the battery, all patients will be engaged in an
      initial technology readiness assessment to gauge comfort and skill using a variety of
      devices (e.g., smartphones, cellular phones, tablets, and laptop computers) that could
      potentially be utilized for delivery of interventions. Patients will then be randomized to
      either care as usual or to the stepped-care technology-based educational intervention.
      Patients randomized to the intervention condition will be met by a trauma support
      specialist. Intervention patients who endorse elevated substance use and/or mental health
      symptoms, including PTSD, depression, suicidal ideation, chronic pain, and postconcussive
      symptoms, will receive up to 3 months of motivational interviewing and/or cognitive
      behavioral therapy delivered by the trauma support specialist in person or over the
      telephone. The trauma support specialist may utilize mHealth technologies including websites
      and applications available on smartphones and tablet devices, as strategies to compliment
      CBT approaches that target specific areas of concern. However, the psychotherapeutic
      intervention embedded within the Stepped Care protocol is conceived of being fundamentally
      separate from the mHealth tools that may also be mentioned during discussions between the
      trauma support specialist and the patient. Inherent throughout the intervention is a focus
      on obtaining acceptability information from patients related to all aspects of the
      intervention and interpersonal experiences with the trauma support specialist, as well as
      any technology-based assessments and mHealth tools that may compliment the stepped care
      protocol. Patients will receive up to 3 consecutive months of trauma support specialist
      support post-injury. Follow-up assessments will occur at 1, 3, and 6 months following the
      baseline assessment, with additional acceptability assessments completed for specific
      aspects of the intervention listed above.

The TSS will complete follow-up correspondence across the three month time period to assess mental health functioning and use of information technology that addresses medical concerns. Patients who report barriers to mHealth technologies and request additional therapeutic services for mental health concerns assistance will receive evidence-based motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral intervention procedures that can span up to 3-months.</description>
