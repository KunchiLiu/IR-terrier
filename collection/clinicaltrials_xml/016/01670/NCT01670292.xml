  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a biomechanical study which is Project 1 in the Developmental Center for Clinical
      and Translational Research in Chiropractic (DCRC I) (NIH/NCCAM grant 1 U19 AT004663-01;
      principal investigator Christine Goertz, DC, PhD). This study is designed to monitor both
      physiological and patient self-report outcome variables. In addition, as there is little
      quantitative information on Spinal Manipulation Technique procedures reported in clinical
      trials, the study is designed to collect preliminary kinetic measures of the spinal
      manipulation technique delivery (i.e. force-time profiles).

      Participants with narrowly defined chronic low back pain will be included in this study.
      Each participant will be treated 12 times over the course of 6 weeks. The following data
      will be collected: participant characteristics that may predict outcome or be modifiers of
      force used by provider (gender, age, height, weight, and Body Mass Index); spinal segment
      load during the pre-load and thrusting phases (force and moment in the pre-load phase, peak
      load, loading rate, and thrust duration; physiological measures (posterior-anterior global
      stiffness and flexion-relaxation); patient-centered outcomes of back pain and function; and
      concomitant medications and treatments.

      Study participants (n= 80) will be recruited from the Quad Cities metro area. A team of
      experienced chiropractic clinicians working at the Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research
      will treat study participants. Each of the study participants will receive 2 High Velocity
      Low Amplitude Spinal Manipulation treatment visits per week over a 6 week period. The
      physiological assessments will be performed immediately before and after Spinal Manipulation
      delivery during treatment visits 1, 5 &amp; 12 (6 sets of assessments in total). During these
      same treatment visits, we will also capture the kinetic measures during Spinal Manipulation
      delivery for spinal segment load analysis. We will further collect thrusting force-time
      profiles of all Spinal Manipulation delivered in the course of treatment for thrust contact
      force analysis. Participant patient-centered outcomes will be measured at baseline 1,
      treatment visits 1, 6, and 13.
