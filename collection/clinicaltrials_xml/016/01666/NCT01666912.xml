    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study comparing two groups of 48 adolescent women each. The
      intervention group will receive a contraceptive implant postpartum, prior to discharge from
      the hospital. The control group will receive a contraceptive implant at the usual 6 week
      postpartum clinic visit. During prenatal care, participants will be consented and screened
      for enrollment. After delivery, these women will be assessed and consented for enrollment
      into the study. Women who consent for enrollment will be randomized. Women will be followed
      up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year after contraceptive implant insertion. At
      each follow up, women will be assessed for continuation of and satisfaction with this method
      of contraception.
