    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well fosaprepitant dimeglumine and granisetron transdermal
      system work in preventing nausea and vomiting in patients with breast cancer undergoing
      chemotherapy. Antiemetic drugs may help lessen or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients
      treated with chemotherapy

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of fosaprepitant (fosaprepitant dimeglumine)
      and granisetron transdermal system in the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy
      induced nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety of the combination of fosaprepitant and granisetron transdermal
      system in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvan or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5âhydroxytryptamine-3
      (5HT3) and neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors as potential markers of efficacy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive granisetron transdermal system patch 24-48 hrs before the
      initiation of chemotherapy. Patients wear the granisetron transdermal system patch for 7
      days. Patients receive fosaprepitant dimeglumine intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on day 1
      of chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every 2 or 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.
