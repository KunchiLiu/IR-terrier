    <textblock>
      For the prediction of late-onset preeclampsia (PE) in low risk women, the investigators
      established a cut-off value for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio and evaluated the combination models of
      Elecys, second trimester uterine artery (UtA) doppler, and fetoplacental proteins for Down
      syndrome screening.

      A prospective study was carried on in Cha hospital. Serum samples for Down syndrome
      screening were assayed to estimate pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A),
      alpha-fetoprotein , unconjugated estriol, human chorionic gonadotrophin , and inhibin-A.
      Women screened for Down syndrome were offered UtA Doppler at 20-24 weeks of gestation and
      then collected serial serum samples for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio at two time points (24-27 and
      34-37 weeks' gestation).
