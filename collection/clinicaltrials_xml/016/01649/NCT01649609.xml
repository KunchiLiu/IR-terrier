      BK virus infections after kidney transplant are increasing and can result in damage to the
      transplanted kidney. Currently, the universally accepted treatment is to decrease the
      strength of the antirejection medications but it is unclear what medications should be
      lowered and to what extent. The investigators propose to perform a study with patients who
      have BK virus detected in their blood during routine screening that appears to be
      increasing. The investigators will use two different strategies that involve different
      combinations of standard anti-rejection medications at lower dosages. Patients will be
      assigned to one of the two groups in a random manner across the two hospitals participating
      in the study. Patients will be followed for at least a year to determine if one strategy was
      more effective than the other in preventing an increase in the number of viruses in the
      blood stream and whether either one was more effective in reducing the negative impact of
      the infection on the functioning of the transplanted kidney.

      The incidence of BK viremia, an early complication after renal transplantation and the
      associated rates of graft loss resulting from BK nephropathy have been steadily rising since
      a series of cases that were reported in the mid-1990's. While this is at least partly
      related to the introduction of newer immunosuppressive agents, recent United Network for
      Organ Sharing (UNOS) data analyses suggest that there is a continuing rise in the incidence
      of BK viremia and associated nephropathy with a 3.5% incidence rate in 2009 representing a
      dramatic rise from just 0.9% only 4 years earlier. Single center data reports have suggested
      much lower rates of BK viremia and nephropathy in cohorts treated with mTOR (mammalian
      target of rapamycin) based immunosuppressive regimens when compared to the overall national
      incidence rates. Recent data has demonstrated that calcineurin inhibitors at concentrations
      routinely used in clinical practice interfere with the BK virus specific T cell responses;
      an interference that is not seen to occur with mTOR inhibitors. Further, recent evidence
      that inhibition of the mTOR pathway has a direct and consequential negative impact on BK
      infected cells provides additional insight into the observed benefit associated with mTOR
      inhibitors. The growing problem of BK viremia among renal transplant patients is further
      compounded by the absence of effective management strategies that have been tested in a
      rigorous or controlled setting - a fact that was highlighted in a recent systematic review.
      The cornerstone for management so far has been the reduction of immunosuppression, largely
      based on the outcome of a single center study of screening patients for viremia and
      following with preemptive lowering of immunosuppression. Conversion from calcineurin
      inhibitors to mTOR inhibitors has been reported in small case series to be an effective
      measure that appears to be superior to merely lowering immunosuppression; however, this
      approach has not been tested with a robust clinical study design.

      Currently, the diagnosis of BK nephropathy requires a renal biopsy, an invasive procedure
      with its own risks. In addition, identification of patients with viremia who progress to
      nephropathy and subsequent graft failure i.e. prognostication does not appear possible with
      the renal biopsy results at present. Validation of potential non-invasive biomarkers
      provides a unique opportunity for both detection and risk stratification of patients with BK
      viremia subsequent failure, which could lead to more informed therapeutic interventions
      while supporting the development of newer therapies.
