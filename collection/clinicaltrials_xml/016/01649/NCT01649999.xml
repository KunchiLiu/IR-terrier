    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP015K monotherapy and to evaluate the
      dose-dependent response of ASP015K in moderate to severe Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) subjects
      given ASP015K for 12 weeks.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled,
      dose-finding, monotherapy, multi-center study with once daily oral ASP015K or matching
      placebo in subjects with moderate to severe RA, with or without prior antirheumatic
      medication, and regardless of responsiveness to the medication.

      The study is comprised of up to a 4-week Screening period, a 12-week Treatment period and a
      4-week Follow-up period.

      Subjects in each treatment group will take ASP015K or matching placebo orally, once daily,
      after breakfast for 12 weeks after the screening period.
