      This research study is being conducted to examine the effects of daily inorganic nitrite
      treatment on the cardiometabolic and hormonal disturbances observed in overweight/obese
      adults with the metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Ultimately, oral nitrite therapy
      may have a major impact on the prevention and treatment of both diabetes and cardiovascular
      disease.

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States and
      worldwide. Several studies have demonstrated that fruit and vegetable rich diets
      significantly reduced blood pressure and reduced the risk of ischemic stroke and
      cardiovascular disease in general, the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood.
      Preclinical and clinical research over the last decade has revealed the important
      vasoprotective effects of nitrates and nitrites with regards to reduction in blood pressure,
      vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. More recent findings suggest that
      inorganic nitrate and nitrite therapy may be involved in the regulation of glucose-insulin
      homeostasis.

      For this reason, development of an oral formulation of nitrite salt represents a rational
      avenue of exploration for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, whereby nitrite would
      ensure rapid acting effects upon absorption which can be further oxidized to nitrate via the
      enterosalivary circulation pathway. In this pathway, about 25% of circulating nitrate is
      concentrated in the saliva and reduced to nitrite by commensal mouth bacteria with nitrate
      reductase enzymes. The proposal is the first human study to investigate the inorganic
      nitrite effects (in any form) on insulin sensitivity in a patient population. This will be
      the second human trial using orally delivered nitrite (previously as aqueous solution).
