  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Informal caregivers provide a majority of care for patients at the end of life. Lack of end
      of life preparation and completion may leave caregivers less capable of caring for a loved
      one or making crucial decisions influencing care.

      This study will examine whether a preparation and completion intervention reduces caregiver
      anxiety, depression, anticipatory grief, and burden and improves patient quality of life and
      health care use

      The investigators propose a randomized control trial to evaluate an intervention of
      end-of-life preparation and completion with Veterans and their caregivers at end-of-life.
      Specific aims are to 1) Evaluate the impact of the caregiver Outlook intervention on
      caregiver anxiety, depression, anticipatory grief, completion, and burden; 2) Evaluate the
      impact of the home versus in hospital, emergency department, or nursing facility; 3)
      Evaluate the impact of the intervention session's qualitative content, examining variation
      associated with selected demographic variables, quality of family communication, and stage
      of illness on change.

      Caregivers in the first group (&quot;treatment&quot;) will meet with a facilitator three times for a
      period of forty-five minutes each. In the first session, subjects will be asked to discuss
      issues related to relationship life review.

      In session two, participants will be asked to speak in more depth about issues such as
      regret and forgiveness. In the final session, subjects will focus on legacy and celebration.
      Caregivers in the second group (&quot;attention control&quot;) will meet with a facilitator three
      times for a period of forty-five minutes each and be asked to listen to a non-guided
      relaxation CD or participate in a guided relaxation exercise.

      Participants in both groups will receive pre and post-test measures administered by a
      blinded interviewer. Outcome measures will be measures by the Functional Assessment of
      Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), Quality of life scale, FACIT-sp sub-scale, Anticipatory
      Grief Scale, Caregiver Reaction Assessment, the Qual-E completion and preparation
      sub-scales, and patient days at home.
