  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label, experimental medicine study to evaluate the efficacy, safety
      and mechanism of action of belimumab in subjects with antiphospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R)
      autoantibody positive idiopathic membranous glomerulonephropathy (IMGN), and to profile the
      relationship between biomarkers, autoantibody status and clinical response. 10 milligrams
      per kilogram (mg/kg) belimumab intravenous (IV) will be administered at weeks 0, 2, and then
      every 4 weeks, over a 24-week treatment period in subjects with anti-PLA2R antibody positive
      IMGN followed by a further long term treatment period until subjects reach remission of
      proteinuria, up to a maximum of 2 years total treatment. All subjects will receive
      background supportive therapy throughout the study. The dosing frequency will be adjusted to
      every 2 weeks if the subject's proteinuria as assessed by urinary protein creatinine ratio
      (PCR) is greater than 1000 milligrams per millimole (mg/mmol) [greater than 10 grams(g)/24
      hours (h)], to compensate for loss of belimumab in the urine. Effects on mechanistic markers
      will be measured by the level of proteinuria, levels of anti-PLA2R antibodies, and various
      other measures of kidney function. These will be compared to historical data. The
      pharmacokinetics of belimumab will be measured to confirm dosing in heavily proteinuric
      subjects. Pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, biomarkers and Quality of Life(QoL) in IMGN subjects
      will also be investigated. Safety will be assessed by adverse events (AE), clinical
      laboratory evaluations, and vital signs.

             (either by light microscope with immuno-fluorescence, or by electron microscope) in
             the last 7 years with non-active disease &gt;3 years (non-active defined as subject not
             on immunosuppressants and proteinuria &lt;2g per 24h) (biopsy results and slides should
             be available for independent evaluation).

          -  Autoantibody: Have positive anti-PLA2R autoantibody test results at screening.

          -  Proteinuria: Have clinically active disease (nephrotic range proteinuria) for at
             least 3 months prior to screening and no improvement (less than 30% reduction),
             despite supportive therapy (which should include maximal tolerated doses of ACE
             inhibitor or ARB unless contraindicated, and may include statins, diuretics, dietary
             salt restriction). During screening proteinuria must be greater than 400mg/mmol by
             PCR (or greater than 4.0g per 24h) as measured from a 24 h urine collection and/or
             spot urine sample (early morning where possible) on 2 occasions at least 7 days
             apart.

          -  Female Subjects: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant

        <description>Proteinuria is being assessed at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60, 68, 76, 84, 92, 100, 104/4 week post last dose and at the 16 week and 6 month follow-up visits. Proteinuria measurements are being based on urinary protein creatinine ratio measurements spot urine samples. For other key time points, Weeks 12, 52, 76 and 4 week post last dose, they are the mean of the PCR from a pre-dose spot urine sample and from a 24 h post-dose or post visit urine collection. Baseline is defined as the mean of the pre and post dosing Day 0 values from 2 consecutive 24 h urine collections. The ratio is defined as the post-Baseline value divided by the Baseline value. The results for this outcome measure will be reported at the end of the study i.e. May 2017, as they were not designed to be reported at interim periods.</description>

        <title>Vital Signs Measurements Assessed up to 116/16 Week Follow-up Visit</title>
        <description>Vital signs including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and temperature were measured throughout the 104-week treatment period and follow-up. Sitting blood pressure/heart rate and body temperature are being measured pre-dose on dosing days. Blood pressure is being measured on at least 2 clinic visits during the Screening phase or by a 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitor. Additionally, weight is being measured at all dosing visits prior to dosing and at Week 104. The results for this outcome measure will be reported at the end of the study i.e. May 2017, as they were not designed to be reported at interim periods.</description>

        <description>Urine membrane attack complex will be assayed quantitatively by ELISA method. Urine MAC samples are being collected at Day 0 and Weeks 8, 28, 52, 76 and 4 week post last dose. Results will be normalized using urine creatinine concentration to adjust for urine dilution, before calculation of the ratio as value at time point divided by value at Baseline (Day 0). The results for this outcome measure will be reported at the end of the study i.e. May 2017, as they were not designed to be reported at interim periods.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in B Cell and T Cell Subpopulations</title>
        <description>Blood samples for flow cytometry quantification of peripheral lymphocyte (B cell and T cell) subpopulations and activation markers are being collected on Day 0 and at the Week 8, 16, 28, 4 week post last dose and 6 month post last dose visits. B cell Facs panels are being used to measure changes over the course of therapy in B cell subsets such as transitional, naïve, memory and plasma B cell compartments by percent of the B cell compartments and absolute numbers. T cell Facs panel are being used to measure changes in T cell subsets, such as T regs and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in terms of numbers and expression of activation markers to establish if B cell targeting with belimumab affects the T cell compartment perhaps through limiting B cell antigen presentation or cytokine release. The results for this outcome measure will be reported at the end of the study i.e. May 2017, as they were not designed to be reported at interim periods.</description>

        <description>Cytokine/chemokines associated with T helper skewing or autoimmune pathology will be analyzed using Luminex, ELISA. Serum analyte quantification is being used to confirm altered protein levels of any gene expression increases or decreases identified by transcriptomic analysis. Cytokine/chemokine samples are being collected on Day 0 and Weeks 8, 16, 28, 52, 76, and 4 week post last dose.
