    <textblock>
      The study is being done to:

        -  test a strategy of using a resistance test to choose anti-HIV drugs. Resistance tests
           look at the HIV in your blood to see which drugs might work best to lower your HIV
           infection.

        -  see how well combinations of new anti-HIV drugs work to lower HIV infection

        -  see if taking new anti-HIV drugs together is safe and tolerable

        -  see if text messages improve people's anti-HIV drug-taking behavior (only at sites
           doing the adherence study)

        -  in people taking certain combinations of anti-HIV drugs with an anti-TB drug, compare
           how these drugs act in the body

        -  in Step 3, to see how people do after they stop having frequent clinic visits as part
           of a research study

For the purposes of this outcome measure, a week 24 measurement includes any HIV-1 RNA measurement obtained at ≥7*22=154 days after randomization (to allow for the protocol-defined 14 day window for scheduling the week 24 visit)</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for Step 1:

          -  HIV-1 infection

          -  Any previous combination of ARV treatment at any time with at least one regimen that
             contained one NNRTI and two NRTIs which was replaced with a PI-based regimen because
             of virologic, immunologic, or clinical treatment failure, or because of toxicity.

        NOTE: All potential participants with prior RAL exposure will be assigned to Cohort D.

          -  Current receipt of a PI-based regimen with no regimen change for a minimum of 24
             weeks prior to screening.

        NOTE A: Within the 30 days prior to collection of the confirmatory VF sample, alteration
        in dose, dose frequency, or any within-class substitution(s) for intolerance is permitted,
        as are drug interruptions for fewer than 7 cumulative days.

        NOTE B: There can be no changes and no drug interruptions within the 3 days immediately
        prior to the collection of the confirmatory VF sample.

          -  Confirmation of VF of current second-line PI-based ART. NOTE A: Failure of the
             current second-line regimen is defined as two consecutive measurements of plasma
             HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL obtained at least 1 day apart while on the current PI-based
             regimen.

        NOTE B: The first measurement of plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL must have been obtained
        after at least 24 weeks of being on the current PI-based regimen and within 240 days prior
        to study entry. This measurement may be obtained from any local laboratory or from medical
        records regardless of the laboratory that performed the test.

        NOTE C: The second measurement of plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL must be obtained within
        103 days prior to study entry and must be performed in a DAIDS-approved laboratory.

          -  CD4+ T-cell count result from a specimen drawn within 103 days prior to study entry;
             the date of specimen draw and CD4+ T-cell count must be recorded.

          -  Certain laboratory values obtained within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Females of reproductive potential (women who have not been post-menopausal for at
             least 24 consecutive months, ie, who have had menses within the preceding 24 months,
             or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization, hysterectomy or bilateral
             salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum
             or urine pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to randomization or registration.

          -  Female participants of reproductive potential must agree not to participate in the
             conception process (ie, active attempt to become pregnant, in vitro fertilization),
             and if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female
             participant must use at least one reliable form of contraceptive. Potential female
             participants must continue to use contraceptives while receiving study treatment and
             for 6 weeks after stopping study treatment.

          -  Female participants who are not of reproductive potential or whose male partner(s)
             has documented azoospermia) are not required to use contraceptives. Any statement of
             self-reported sterility or that of her partner's must be entered in the source
             documents.

        NOTE: Acceptable documentation of lack of reproductive potential is oral or written
        documentation from the participant.

          -  Karnofsky performance score &gt;/= 70 within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Ability and willingness of potential participant to provide informed consent.

          -  Willingness of potential participant to adhere to protocol requirements, especially
             with respect to treatment assignment and ability to obtain non-study provided ART, if
             needed.

          -  Ability to take oral study medications.

          -  No intention of permanent relocation that would preclude attending Step 1 and 2 study
             follow-up visits.

          -  Availability of a successful, interpretable resistance genotype report from a
             DAIDS-approved regional genotyping facility from testing performed on a plasma sample
             that was collected during screening (ie, at or after the date that a sample is
             collected to confirm HIV-1 virologic failure) and which was shipped to a regional
             resistance testing laboratory once documentation of two screening plasma HIV-1 RNA
             values ≥1000 copies/mL was available.

        NOTE: A repeat test of the original sample is acceptable if the initial genotype results
        are not available due to technical reasons.

          -  Identification of a cohort assignment and ARV regimen for use on study, selected from
             the recommended options provided by the site investigator, and reviewed and approved
             by the A5288 CMC.

        NOTE: The final CMC-approved cohort (A, B, C, or D) and planned ARV regimen must be
        entered into the enrollment system, the ACS, and kept in hardcopy as source documentation
        at the site.

        Exclusion Criteria for Step 1:

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding.

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drugs or
             their formulation.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          -  Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until candidate
             either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the
             site investigator, for at least 7 days prior to study entry.

          -  Concurrent illness or condition that would compromise the ability to take study
             medication, follow the protocol, or that would make participation not in the best
             interest of the participant, per the site investigator.

          -  Requirement for taking any of the prohibited medications with the selected ARV study
             regimen, or within 14 days prior to study entry.

          -  Active tuberculosis (TB) or rifampin exposure less than 2 weeks prior to study entry.
