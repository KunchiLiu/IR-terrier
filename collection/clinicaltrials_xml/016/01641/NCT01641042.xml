  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of
      the new meningococcal vaccine 134612 in subjects with increased risk of meningococcal
      disease and compare it to its activity in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each at risk subject enrolled, an age-matched healthy subject will be enrolled. Age
      matching will be performed according to the following age strata: 1-5 years, 6-10 years,
      11-17 years.
