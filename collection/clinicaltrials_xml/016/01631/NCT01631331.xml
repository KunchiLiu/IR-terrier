      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effect of vismodegib on sporadic basal cell
      carcinoma (BCCs) prior to surgical removal.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The percent reduction in surgical defect area/size surrounding BCC tumor pre and
      post-vismodegib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Bread-loafing histology will be used to determine if the tumor after vismodegib shrinks
      as one discrete lesion (contiguous) vs. with skip areas (non-contiguous) II. The percent
      reduction in tumor size pre and post-vismodegib. III. Safety, tolerability and percent
      drop-out after 3 vs. 6 months of vismodegib in otherwise healthy patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 3 months if the initial
      BCC size is &lt; 2 cm and superficial or for up to 6 months if the initial BCC size is &gt;= 2 cm
      or non-superficial. After completion of vismodegib treatment, patients undergo Mohs surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.

    <measure>Anti-tumor effect as measured by the percent change in surgical defect area against the null hypothesis of no change after the treatment period using calipers and photographs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be tested against the null hypothesis of no change as a one-sample t-test. A p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. We will first perform non-parametric paired t-test taking this account, and also use more sophisticated methods such as the MIXED procedure (PROC MIXED) treating each subject as a random effect and time as fixed effect, with appropriate correlation structure.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study patients must have at least one BCC, &gt; 5 mm, eligible for Mohs surgical
             removal; patients with BCCs that have been treated before (recurrent BCCs, BCCs that
             failed other chemotherapy) are eligible for this trial, if they meet size criteria

          -  No Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) or Karnofsky performance status will be
             employed

          -  Normal hepatic function: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Normal renal function : normal serum creatinine defined as &lt;= 2.5 mg/dL

          -  Clinically acceptable complete blood count (CBC)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  The patient is willing to forego surgical treatment of BCCs by up to 6 months, except
             when the principal investigator (PI) believes that delay in treatment potentially
             might compromise the health of the subject

          -  Documented negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, with
             agreement to the use of two acceptable methods of contraception during the study and
             for 7 months after discontinuation of vismodegib

          -  For men with female partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use a latex,
             non-latex, or any other male condom and to advise their female partners to use an
             additional acceptable method of birth control during the study and for 2 months after
             discontinuation of study drug

          -  Be willing to not donate blood or semen for three months following discontinuation of
             study medications

        Exclusion Criteria:

             breast, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) stage 0

          -  The subject has uncontrolled systemic disease, including known human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) positive patients:

               -  The patient has history of congestive heart failure

               -  The patient has clinically important history of liver disease, including viral
                  or hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis

               -  The patient has any condition or situation which in the investigator's opinion
                  may put the patient at significant risk, could confound the study results, or
                  could interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study;
                  this includes history of other skin conditions or disease, metabolic
                  dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving
                  reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use of an
                  investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of the
                  study or render the patient at high risk from treatment complications

          -  The patient has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study
             medication formulations

          -  The patient is willing to abstain from application of non-study topical medications
             to the skin for the duration of the study, including prescription and over the
             counter preparations; for example, topical preparations containing corticosteroids or
             vitamin A derivatives are not allowed

          -  Pregnant or nursing patients will be excluded from the study
