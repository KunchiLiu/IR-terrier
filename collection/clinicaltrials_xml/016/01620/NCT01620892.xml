  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to evaluate the condition of patients 5 years after having undergone partial
      knee replacement for localized osteoarthritis of the knee. Participating patients will
      voluntarily undergo detailed evaluation of clinical and radiologic outcomes 5 years after
      surgery. The aims of the study are to describe the survivorship of the prostheses and the
      clinical results of patients, and to elucidate and describe the natural history disease of
      the untreated knee joint compartments after a partial replacement. Patients who were
      operated by the principal investigator 5 years previously will be invited to participate.
      The study is observational in nature; there is no element of experimentation or test of an
      intervention.

    <description>Eligible participants are invited to enroll into this observational study after the 5-year anniversary of the index primary knee replacement procedure. The participant will be evaluated once to determine whether the original implant is in situ, or has been revised. Method of determination will include self-report of the participant, medical records review/verification, and radiographic examination of the prosthesis.</description>

        The potential study population consists of all patients who have undergone implantation of
        a specific unicondylar knee arthroplasty device under the care of the principal
        investigator between December, 2006 and December, 2008. This is a clinic-based sample of
        consecutive cases.
