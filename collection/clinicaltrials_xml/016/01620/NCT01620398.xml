      There are no studies exploring the benefits of a diet composed of typical Brazilian food in
      the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Randomized studies show that the
      Mediterranean diet is beneficial for patients with established cardiovascular disease or in
      risk for CVD development. Indeed, nutritional composition of the Mediterranean Diet is one
      of main references for dietary guidelines for treatment and prevention of CVD in Brazil and
      the world. However, in many countries, such as Brazil, most foods of the Mediterranean diet
      are not widely available, may be expensive or are not part of population eating habits. So,
      the prescription of the Mediterranean diet intervention for cardiovascular disease to the
      Brazilian population may not be feasible, leading to a low adherence. In this context,
      patients with established CVD have a low compliance to nutritional prescription. The BALANCE
      Program, considers 3 concepts: a) A dietary prescription guided by nutritional content
      recommendations from the Brazilian national guidelines; b) A nutritional education program
      based on fun, playful strategies and suggestions of affordable foods; and c) Intensive
      follow-up through one-on-one visits, group sessions, and phone calls. This is the first
      proposal to use these concepts concurrently with the objective to increase adherence of
      secondary prevention patients to the diet proposed by the guidelines. Therefore, this trial
      will investigate the effects of the Program on reducing cardiovascular events - such as
      cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, myocardial revascularization,
      amputation for peripheral arterial disease, and hospitalization for unstable angina - or
      death in patients with established CVD. Moreover, it will evaluate the effects of the
      dietary program on reducing CV factors, such as BMI, waist circumference,

      The BALANCE Program will investigate the effect of the Program in reducing cardiovascular
      events, such as cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, myocardial
      revascularization, amputation for peripheral arterial disease, hospitalization for unstable
      angina, or death in patients with established cardiovascular disease. Moreover we aim to
      evaluate the effect of the dietary program on reducing cardiovascular risk factors, such as
      body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, total cholesterol, low density
      lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides and fasting glucose. Also it is our objective to compare
      the dietary patterns after interventions, the effect of the intervention among nutrients and
      energy consumption and, finally, to evaluate the BALANCE Program comprehension.

      The BALANCE Program is a randomized, multicenter, national trial with allocation concealment
      and intention-to-treat analysis. We will randomize patients aged 45 years or more with any
      evidence of established cardiovascular disease to the BALANCE program or control groups.
      BALANCE Program is composed by 3 concepts: a) a diet that provides 50-60% of energy from
      carbohydrate, 10-15% from protein, 25-35% from total fat, &lt;7% from saturated fatty acids,
      &lt;10% polyunsaturated fatty acids, &lt;20% monounsaturated fatty acids, &lt;1% trans fats, &lt;200
      mg/day cholesterol, 20-30 g/day fiber, and &lt;2,400 mg/day sodium; b) Nutrition education
      program based on ludic strategies and indication of affordable foods; c) An intense follow
      up by individual and group visits and phone calls. For Control group, generalized advices to
      follow a low fat, low energy, low sodium and low cholesterol diet are given. The primary
      composite outcome is the occurrence of cardiovascular death, cardiac arrest, acute
      myocardial infarction, stroke, and myocardial revascularization, amputation for peripheral
      arterial disease or hospitalization for unstable angina. Blinded assessors will adjudicate
      clinical events and analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. We enrolled 2536
      patients in 34 sites. Enrollment was open in March 2013 and ended in March 2015 and patients
      will be followed up to 48 months.

    <description>Participants will be encourage to follow a generalized diet counseling prepared by dietitians based on low fat, low energy, low sodium and low cholesterol diets. They will receive a common folder composed by lists of foods that should be preferred or avoided. For example, avoidance of ultra processed foods, preference for boiled and baked foods rather than fried foods and recommendation of having at least five meals a day. This folder is equivalent of several that are given on ambulatories or hospital of Brazilian public health.</description>
