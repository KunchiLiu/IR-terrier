    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to expand understanding of the effects of cannabis on driving
      performance with and without the presence of low levels of alcohol.

      This project will involve the development a of a protocol and driving environment that is
      sensitive to the effects of cannabis on driving performance by building on prior driving
      situations used previously for testing the effects of alcohol on driving.

      Individuals will be recruited who are currently users of cannabis and alcohol to participate
      in this study. They will undergo a physical exam at screening. There will be six study
      visits where the subject will arrive at the Clinical Research Unit(University of Iowa
      Hospitals &amp; Clinics) the night before dosing. At each visit subjects will be receive one of
      the following six dosing regimens: placebo alcohol with placebo cannabis; placebo alcohol
      with low-dose cannabis, placebo alcohol with higher-dose of cannabis, low dose alcohol with
      placebo cannabis; low dose alcohol with low dose cannabis, low dose alcohol with higher-dose
      of cannabis. After dosing, participants will have provide saliva samples and blood drawn
      periodically to check cannabis levels and will complete a driving simulation. After
      completing the drive, additional saliva samples and blood draws will occur and participants
      will be monitored until it is safe to transport home.
