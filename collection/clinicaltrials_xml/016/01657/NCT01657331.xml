    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 multicenter study to assess the safety and effectiveness of brentuximab
      vedotin and bendamustine, when given together, in patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma or
      Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) that has either returned or did not respond to initial
      treatment(s). Patients will be accrued at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) and at
      two subsites in Canada.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brentuximab vedotin will be administered as an outpatient IV infusion on day 1 of each
      21-day cycle. Bendamustine will be given as an outpatient infusion on days 1 and 2 of a
      21-day cycle. Patients may receive prophylactic pegfilgrastim on day 3 of each cycle, or
      filgrastim for 5 to 10 days, per investigator's discretion. Patients can receive a maximum
      of 6 cycles of therapy.
