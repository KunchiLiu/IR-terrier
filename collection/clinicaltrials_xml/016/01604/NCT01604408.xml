  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LY2495655 is an investigational drug being tested for muscle wasting. Muscle wasting
      includes shrinking of the muscle and weakness. This can occur when a muscle is no longer as
      active as usual. When muscles are no longer in use, they become weaker.
