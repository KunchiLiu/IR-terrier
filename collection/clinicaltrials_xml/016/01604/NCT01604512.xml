  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine if MRI perfusion and PET/CT can tell growing tumor and radiation
      injury apart. MRI perfusion looks at the blood vessels in the tumor. PET/CT looks if the
      tumor cells are actively growing. The investigators will do these two tests and see which
      one is better.

      Optional Second MRI Perfusion

      The investigators may ask the patient to undergo a second MRI perfusion scan. They are
      testing this second scan to see how well it works. It can cover the entire brain. It takes
      about an 5 extra minutes in the scanner. If they decide to undergo this second scan, they
      will divide the usual IV contrast dose into two parts. The patient will not receive extra IV
      contrast for this second scan. This second scan is optional.

    <description>The MRI perfusion and PET/CT scans will be obtained within 12 weeks of each other. These scans are part of the standard of care for patients with brain tumors and uncertain tumor response or progression after treatment. Although every effort will be made to perform both MRI perfusion and PET/CT on the same day or during the same week, some patients may experience longer intervals between scans due to scheduling conflicts. The disease in question (radiation injury vs. tumor progression) may change slightly during this interval (e.g., the lesion may grow or shrink slightly), but no large changes are expected between the two scans. The patients may continue existing treatments in the interval between scans (e.g., steroids, chemotherapy), but the two scans must be performed before any change or new treatment occurs. Fusion images of MRI and PET/CT will not be reviewed by the neuroradiologist interpreting the MRI perfusion nor the nuclear medicine radiologist interpreting the PET/CT.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathological or clinical/radiological diagnosis of aneoplasm , either primary (e.g.,

             of brain radiation therapy

          -  Completed fractionated radiation therapy (to 60 Gy for high grade gliomas) or
             stereotactic radiosurgery or hypofractionated radiation therapy (e.g. for brain
             metastases, anaplastic meningiomas), without or with concurrent chemotherapy

          -  New or increased enhancing brain lesion(s) OR nonenhancing brain lesion(s) if
             receiving anti-angiogenic therapy, which is considered indeterminate for tumor
