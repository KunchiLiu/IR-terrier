  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in performing a detailed examination of the pancreas via
      EUS (Endoscopic Ultra Sound)for patients referred for a non-pancreatic condition. The
      hypothesis is to make a statistical determination of how many pancreatic cysts the
      investigators discover incidentally.

    <description>Cross-sectional imaging identifies cystic neoplasms in up to 1.2% of the general population. However, data from an autopsy series reports pancreatic cysts in up to 24% of patients.EUS can identify small cysts that are not seen on CT scan, MRI or other cross sectional imaging we hypothesize that pancreatic cysts are present between 1.2 and 24% of the population, with rates varying by variables such as age and a previous diagnosis of pancreatitis. The purpose of this study is to identify the prevalence of pancreatic cysts in patients undergoing EUS for non-pancreatic indications .</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The inclusion criteria included: patients &gt;18 years old with decision making capacity
             referred for EUS for any other indication other than the evaluation of a known
             pancreatic cyst, solid mass, or suspected mass.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any known history or evidence of the following from any previous imaging study:
             pancreatic cyst, solid mass, suspected pancreatic mass, dilated main pancreatic duct

          -  Previous surgical resection of any portion of the upper GI tract such as Billroth II
             that would not permit complete EUS exam of the pancreas

          -  Laboratory and/or clinical evidence of ongoing acute pancreatitis

          -  Previous pancreatic surgical resection

          -  Pregnancy
