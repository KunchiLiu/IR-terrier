      Multicenter, randomized, assessor-blinded controlled study of safety and effectiveness of
      the PneumRx, Inc. RePneu Lung Volume Reduction Coil (RePneu LVRC) System
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled study comparing outcomes
      between the LVRC and Control Groups. Subjects will be block randomized in an LVRC
      (Treatment) to Control ratio of 1:1. The randomization will be stratified by homogeneous
      versus heterogeneous emphysema, to support a balance of patients with differing
      heterogeneity in both the LVRC and Control Groups.

    <description>The RePneu Lung Volume Reduction Coil System is an implantable device, delivered through a fiber-optic bronchoscope. This is a two part system that consists of 1) sterile Nitinol Coils and 2) a sterile, disposable, single-use (single-patient) Delivery System consisting of a Guidewire, Catheter, Cartridge, and Forceps.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control arm is standard medical care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Control Group will not undergo any bronchoscopies for Coil placement and will not receive prophylactic antibiotics or steroids before and after 'treatment' or chest x-rays in connection with the 'treatment' visits. The frequency of visits to the Study Doctor or designee will be similar to the LVRC Group.</description>

          -  Subject has stopped smoking for at least 8 weeks prior to entering the study as
             confirmed by a Cotinine test or other appropriate diagnostic test.

          -  Subject has completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program within 6 mos prior to
             treatment and/or is regularly performing maintenance respiratory rehabilitation if
             initial supervised therapy occurred more than 6 mos prior to baseline testing.

          -  Subject has received Pneumococcal and Influenza vaccinations consistent with local
             recommendations and/or policy.

          -  Subject (and legal guardian, if applicable) has read, understood, and signed the
             Informed Consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has severe homogeneous emphysema determined by Core Radiology Lab.

          -  Subject has co-morbidities that may significantly reduce subject's ability to improve
             exercise capacity (e.g., severe arthritis, planned knee surgery) or baseline
             limitation on 6MWT is not due to dyspnea.

          -  Subject has a change in FEV1 of greater than 20% (or, for subjects with
             pre-bronchodilator FEV1 below 1L, a change of greater than 200mL) post-bronchodilator
             unless investigator can confirm by other means that subject does not have asthma.

          -  Subject has DLCO of less than 20% of predicted.

             of the subject for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject is pregnant or lactating, or plans to become pregnant within the study
             timeframe.

          -  Subject has an inability to tolerate bronchoscopy under moderate sedation or general
             anesthesia.

          -  Subject has clinically significant bronchiectasis.

          -  Subject has giant bullae &gt;1/3 lung volume

          -  Subject has had previous LVR surgery, lung transplantation, lobectomy or LVR devices
             in either lung.

          -  Subject has been involved in pulmonary drug or device studies within 30 days prior to
             this study.

          -  Subject is taking &gt;20mg prednisone (or equivalent dose of a similar steroid) daily.

          -  Subject has any other disease, condition(s) or habit(s) that would interfere with
             completion of study and follow up assessments, would increase risks of bronchoscopy
             or assessments, or in the judgment of the investigator would potentially interfere
             with compliance to this study or would adversely affect study outcomes.

          -  Subject has a sensitivity or allergy to nitinol (nickel-titanium) or its constituent
             metals.
