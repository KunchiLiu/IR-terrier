      This study was designed to evaluate the effect of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS) in the resolution of Chronic Pain. Participants will be Veterans from the
      first Gulf War (GW1) who often suffer from chronic pain problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have been conducted on the health of Veterans deployed to Iraq during
      GW1. The focus of these studies has been primarily to define the nature of symptoms and
      symptom clusters and to determine if evidence supports the definition of a new unique
      illness. Most noteworthy is the &quot;Iowa Study&quot;, a cross-sectional study of 3,695 Veterans from
      Iowa consisting of those who were and were not deployed in GW1. In telephone interviews the
      Gulf War deployed Veterans reported approximately twice the number of symptoms compared to
      those who were not deployed.

      The often ambiguous and seemingly treatment resistant symptoms presented by GW1 Veterans
      represent a challenge to the Veteran's Affairs Health Care System on two fronts; efficacy in
      treatment and cost. In particular, unlike most medical conditions which can be diagnosed by
      objective medical findings, pain is a subjective experience (International Association for
      the Study of Pain, 1994). Therefore the investigators propose to engage in a clinical trial
      of rTMS in chronic pain that occurs in the context of multiple medical symptoms in the GW1
      population. The symptom category approach will be applied with the restriction that enrolled
      GWI diagnosed patients will have symptoms of chronic pain as outlined in the musculoskeletal
      category and at least two additional symptoms.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Born between 1936 and 1973 (ages 18 to 55 during Gulf War I) and were deployed to the
             Persian Gulf during Gulf War I.

          -  Patients must have symptoms suggestive of Gulf War Illness, including

               -  Chronic pain &gt;= 4 on the pain severity scale of the BPI-SF at screening

               -  At least 2 other symptoms in at least one of the other five (5) categories
                  defined by the 2013 IOM report (Gulf War and Health, Treatment for Chronic
                  Multisymptom Illness): fatigue, mood and cognition, gastrointestinal,
                  respiratory, and neurological

          -  Ability to obtain a Motor Threshold (MT) will be determined at the end of the
             screening process.

          -  If on a psychotropic medication regimen, that regimen will be stable for at least 4
