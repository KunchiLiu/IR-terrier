  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that AFOLIA, a recombinant manufactured human follicle
      stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) has a similar efficacy and safety profile compared to the
      widely used and marketed r-hFSH Gonal-f.

      Comparison of the clinical pregnancy rate in the AFOLIA group compared to the Gonal-f group
      as the primary endpoint. Comparison of the number and size of follicles, the number of cycle
      cancellation, the hormone parameters and adverse events in the AFOLIA group compared to the
      Gonal-f group as secondary endpoints.
