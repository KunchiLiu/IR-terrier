    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of laboratory-treated T cells and to see how
      well they work in treating patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) that has returned
      after a period of improvement (relapsed), previously treated with donor stem cell
      transplant. Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy, may stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Placing a gene that has
      been created in the laboratory into a person's T cells may make the body build an immune
      response to kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with treating patients with high
      risk or relapsed AML, MDS, and CML after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
      by adoptive transfer of virus-specific cluster of differentiation (CD)8 T cells
      genetically-modified to express a high affinity Wilms tumor 1 (WT1)-specific T cell receptor
      (TCR).

      II. Determine the anti-leukemic activity associated with treating patients with relapsed
      AML, MDS and CML after allogeneic HCT by adoptive transfer of virus-specific CD8 T cells
      genetically-modified to express a high affinity WT1-specific T cell receptor (TCR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the in vivo persistence of transferred T cells and ability to migrate to and
      accumulate in bone marrow.

      II. Determine the maintenance of TCR expression and function of transduced T cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients with no evidence of leukemia or MDS post-HCT receive WT1-sensitized T cells
      intravenously (IV) over 45 minutes (or longer for patients who are 15-30 kg) on days 0 and
      14 and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 14-28.

      ARM II: Patients with evidence of leukemia (AML or CML) or MDS (minimal residual disease or
      overt relapse) post-HCT receive WT1-sensitized T cells IV over 45 minutes (or longer for
      patients who are 15-30 kg) on days 0 and 14 and aldesleukin SC BID on days 14-28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 4 weeks, at weeks 6
      and 8, at 3, 6, 12 months, and then annually for up to 15 years.
