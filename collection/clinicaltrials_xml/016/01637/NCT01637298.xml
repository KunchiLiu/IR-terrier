      The goals of this application are to assess the usefulness of biomarkers, including p16
      proteins, minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins, high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)
      types, and E6 and E7 mRNA/oncoproteins, as adjunct tools to anal Pap smear in identifying
      HGAIN and to study the impact of HIV infection on the characteristics of anal cytology (by
      anal Pap smear) and biomarkers. To fulfill these goals, in addition to routine practice, it
      will be necessary to follow 450 MSM (315 HIV-positives and 135 HIV-negatives) over 60
      months, and perform HRA and biomarkers on all clients at baseline and every 12 months.
      Information from this study would inform AIN screening and follow up approaches in
      HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM in both resource-limited and resource-rich settings.
