    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies pregabalin in preventing acute pain syndrome in
      patients receiving paclitaxel. Pregabalin may control the pain caused by cancer treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain pilot data regarding the possible effect of pregabalin on
      pain related to paclitaxel-associated acute pain syndrome (P-APS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I.
      To obtain pilot data regarding the possible effect of pregabalin on paclitaxel-induced
      peripheral neuropathy. II. To obtain pilot data regarding the possible relative toxicities
      related to pregabalin therapy in this study situation. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To
      characterize neurological testing abnormalities that might occur with the P-APS, and to
      evaluate neurological testing abnormalities during the period of the longer-term
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). II. To determine the PRO incidence and
      characteristics of, and change in, P-APS and paclitaxel induced more chronic CIPN over
      several cycles. These data will serve to confirm the results obtained in our previous
      natural history study N08C1. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM
      I: Patients receive pregabalin orally (PO) twice daily (BID), beginning on the first night
      of chemotherapy, for 12 weeks and then once daily (QD) for 1 week. ARM II: Patients receive
      placebo PO BID, beginning on the first night of chemotherapy, for 12 weeks and then QD for 1
      week. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 6
      months.
