  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      43 adult patients with dumping syndrome will receive 3 months of pasireotide s.c. during the
      dose escalation phase (dose can be increased based on the presence of hypoglycemia during
      OGTT). From Month 3- to Month 6 patients will then switch to pasireotide LAR. The core phase
      of the study is completed at tghe end of Month 6. Patients will be offered to enter into the
      6 month extension phase if they experienced benefit with pasireotide LAR treatment
