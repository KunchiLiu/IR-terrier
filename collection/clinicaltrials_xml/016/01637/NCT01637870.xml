    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at determining whether or not the use of a wound suction device placed
      on the cesarean incision instead of a standard sterile dressing will decrease the prevalence
      of wound complications and wound infections in women at high risk for post operative
      complications. The study will first look at the infection and wound complication rate in
      women 6 months prior to the start date of the study by reviewing charts of women who have
      undergone a cesarean section. The study involves placing a single use, portable wound vacuum
      over the cesarean section incision and keeping it in place for 72h. The investigators will
      then compare the rates of wound infection and wound complications between these two groups.

      It is our hypothesis that negative pressure wound systems will decrease the wound infection
      and complication rate in this high risk population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infectious complications have been found to be five times higher in women undergoing a
      cesarean delivery compared to a vaginal delivery. Known risk factors for wound complications
      are obesity, premature rupture of membranes, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders,
      emergency cesarean delivery, twin delivery, chorioamnionitis, increased surgical blood loss
      and preeclampsia.

      This study is aimed at determining whether or not the use of a suction device placed on the
      wound instead of a standard sterile dressing will decrease the prevalence of wound
      complications and wound infections in women at high risk for post operative complications.
      The investigators will use a group of historical controls collected for 6 consecutive months
      prior to initiation of the study. The study involves placing a single use, portable negative
      wound pressure system kept in place while in the hospital after surgery (on average 48-72
      hours) in women who meet criteria for increased risk of wound complications. The
      investigators will then compare the rates of wound infection and wound complications between
      these two groups.
