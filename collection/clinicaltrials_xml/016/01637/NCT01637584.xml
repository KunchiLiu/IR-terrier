    <textblock>
      The overarching objectives of this study are: 1) To investigate the neurobiology of
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during REM and NREM sleep relative to wakefulness; 2)
      To identify the neurobiological underpinnings of sleep treatment response to prazosin or
      placebo during wakefulness, REM sleep, and NREM sleep in OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD; and 3)
      To explore pre-treatment brain activity patterns during wakefulness, REM sleep, and NREM
      sleep that predict sleep treatment response. We will also explore the stability of the PET
      signal by comparing pre- and post-placebo changes in brain glucose metabolism in
      non-responders. For non-PTSD veterans, the stability of the PET signal will be evaluated in
      a subsample of 6 veterans without PTSD who will repeat the PET imaging procedures 8 weeks
      after the initial PET series.

      The overarching hypothesis is that PTSD is characterized by neurobiological alterations in
      the amygdala, mPFC, and brain centers involved in the regulation of NREM and REM sleep, and
      that these neurobiological changes are normalized with effective sleep treatment.

      PTSD affects both daytime functioning and sleep. Complaints of poor sleep, objective
      disruption of sleep, and heightened sympathovagal tone during sleep occurring early after
      trauma exposure increase the risk of developing PTSD up to one year later. (1-4). Insomnia
      is one the most common reasons for referral to mental health services in active duty
      personnel (5). In military personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, more than 70
      percent of those with PTSD report sleep problems and fatigue, whereas more than 25% percent
      of those without PTSD endorse these symptoms (6). Other disruptive nocturnal behaviors and
      sleep disorders including sleep terrors, nocturnal anxiety attacks, simple and complex motor
      behaviors and vocalizations, acting out dreams, sleep apnea, and periodic leg movement
      disorders are also frequently reported by PTSD patients (7-12). In PTSD, sleep disturbances
      independently contribute to poor clinical outcomes such as increased severity of daytime
      PTSD symptoms (8), depression (13), suicidality (13), general psychiatric distress (14),
      poorer quality of life and functioning (14), poorer perceived physical health (14), and
      increased substance use (15;16).
