  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that education will improve exercise capacity, symptoms and
      quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition,
      the investigators are interested in determining how education might alter various chemicals
      in the blood and exhaled breath that reflect inflammation in the lungs and the body as a
      whole.

      The investigators plan to enroll 42 patients into this study, with half of them
      participating at each of the two sites, Vermont Lung Center at the University of Vermont in
      Burlington, Vermont, and at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Participants will
      undergo a series of measurements and tests at the beginning of the study, receive formal
      education about COPD over the next 2 weeks, return at 6 weeks for a brief refresher session,
      and finally return after 12 weeks for repeat measurement and testing as was done at the
      beginning. Participants will be asked to keep a diary of symptoms, medication, and exercise
      during the study.
