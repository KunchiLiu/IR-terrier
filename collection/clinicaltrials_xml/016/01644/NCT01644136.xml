    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to investigate if the application of Arista absorbable
      hemostat (AH)Â®, a product approved to stop surgical bleeding, can prevent lymphoceles.
      Lymphoceles are collections of lymphatic fluid which can occur after a lymph node dissection
      for cancer. These fluid collections can become symptomatic in some patients. Arista would be
      applied to one side of the pelvis after a pelvic lymph node dissection, to see if this
      decreases the number of postoperative lymph fluid collections seen on a computed tomography
      (CT) scan after surgery

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether, if applied to the lymph node basins after pelvic lymph node
      dissection, Arista could potentially reduce the formation of lymphoceles and consequently
      the need for secondary interventions.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node
      dissection. After lymph node dissection, patients undergo microsphere-mediated lymphocele
      prevention to the lymph node basin on one side of the pelvis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.

    <description>The rate of lymphoceles on each side of the pelvis will be compared. Summary statistics will be reported (mean, standard deviation, and range for the continuous variables and frequency and percentages for the categorical variables). In addition, we will determine interrelationships among specific variables using regression and correlation analyses.</description>
