  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to selectively control blood flow through an arteriovenous (AV) graft only when
      it is needed for dialysis may reduce the current repetitive complications such as
      thrombosis, venous hypertension and blood steal from the extremities. The Hemoaccess Valve
      System (HVS) allows an AV graft to be turned on to blood flow when it is needed for dialysis
      then when dialysis is concluded, the device's valves are activated, shutting off the flow of
      blood through the graft. The graft is then flushed with sterile saline using the dialysis
      blood lines. By having only saline in the graft and restoring normal blood flow to the
      artery and vein, it is believed that this will dramatically reduce the current complications
      with having blood diverted through the graft 24/7.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Hemoaccess Valve System (HVS) is a subcutaneous valve device that is implanted when a
      new AV graft is placed. It consists of a silicone port into which 3cc of sterile saline is
      injected. The fluid travels through connective tubing to two balloon valves which expand
      inside small rigid cuffs which surround the end ends of the graft at the venous and arterial
      anastomoses. The expansion of the balloons inside the cuffs close off the graft to blood
      flow. Once the graft is closed off, blood inside the graft is flushed out with sterile
      saline and using the dialysis needles which are still in place in the graft at the end of
      dialysis. Once the graft is cleared of blood, the sterile saline along with heparin remain
      in the graft between dialysis sessions. At the next dialysis session, the 3cc of saline in
      the balloon valves is aspirated out, deflating the valves and allowing blood to flow to the
      graft for dialysis. (The saline inside the graft simply enters the blood stream.)

      By only having saline inside the AV graft between dialysis sessions, there is no
      post-dialysis bleeding where the dialysis needles were cannulated, and because blood flow is
      restored to its normal course in the vein and artery, the traditional turbulent blood flow
      through the graft is eliminated, reducing the traditional complications caused when arterial
      blood is diverted through the graft then into the vein.

    <description>Determine if the ability to limit blood flow to an AV graft only when it is needed for dialysis will reduce current repetitive thromboses by a minimum of 50% in the graft due to continuous blood flow through it. The New England Journal of Medicine study, &quot;Effect of Dipyridamole plus Aspirin on Hemodialysis Graft Patency&quot; (NEJM 360;21, 5/21/09) indicated a 1 year unassisted patency rate of 23% (77% required intervention). Our objective is to determine if the intervention rate can be reduced to 38-39% during the study, a 50% reduction in the expected intervention rate.</description>

    <measure>Eliminate Post-Dialysis Needle Site Bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome measure: Reduce post-dialysis needle site bleeding by 95%.
Currently most dialysis patients experience mild to severe post-dialysis bleeding when the large (15 gauge) dialysis needles are removed from their AV graft. The HVS device shuts off blood flow to the graft after dialysis therefore no post-dialysis bleeding should be experienced.</description>
