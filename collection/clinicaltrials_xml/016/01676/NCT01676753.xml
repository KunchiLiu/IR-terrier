      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and tolerability (maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD)) of weekly dinaciclib in combination with every 3 week pembrolizumab in patients
      with advanced breast cancer. Once this is defined, a 20 patient dose expansion will be
      performed at this MTD in patients with metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable
      triple negative breast cancer, to evaluate the efficacy of combined dinaciclib and
      pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase Ib trial of weekly dinaciclib in combination with every 3 week
      pembrolizumab in patients with advanced breast cancer. Any number of prior therapies is
      allowed. Pembrolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks at a fixed dose of 200 mg IV.
      Dinaciclib will be administered D1 and D8 of a 21 day cycle by 2-hour intravenous infusion.
      In phase 1, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dinaciclib monotherapy in solid tumors is 12
      mg/m2. The starting dose level of this study will be dinaciclib 12 mg/m2 in combination with
      pembrolizumab 200 mg IV as no overlapping toxicities are expected. The dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) window is 21 days (1 cycle). The dose of dinaciclib will not be escalated
      beyond the 12 mg/m2 starting dose level, but dose de-escalation will occur if necessary
      following a 3+3 design.

      The primary objective is to define the maximum tolerated dose of dinaciclib when given
      weekly in this combination and schedule. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability.
      Once a MTD for dinaciclib is defined, a 20 patient dose expansion will be performed at the
      MTD in patients with metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable triple negative breast
      cancer. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the preliminary efficacy of this
      combination using RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST. Exploratory studies characterizing and
      correlating PDL-1 (programmed death ligand-1) and MYC (myelocytomatosis oncogene)
      overexpression with clinical response will be performed.

      Tumor biopsies are optional in the dose escalation cohort, but mandatory in the dose
      expansion cohort unless otherwise specified.
