      In this Phase II study a single dose 2.8 mg (eight 0.35 mg siG12D-LODERs) will be
      administered to patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer combined with
      chemotherapy treatment.

      Primary Outcome:

      - Progression-free survival (PFS) in the study population.

      In this Phase II study a single dose 2.8 mg (eight 0.35 mg siG12D-LODERs) will be
      administered to patients with unresectable LAPC combined with chemotherapy treatment
      (Gemcitabine+nab-Paclitaxel). This will be the first study to assess the response rate of
      the siG12D-LODER in patients with unresectable LAPC. The study is of a two-arm design with
      one arm receiving siG12D-LODER + chemotherapy, while the other arm receiving only
      chemotherapy.

      The investigational agent siG12D-LODER is a miniature biodegradable bio polymeric matrix
      that encompasses the drug, designed and produced by Silenseed Ltd. The implantation of
      LODERs is selected to meet current gastroenterology endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) biopsy
      procedures, proved to be highly effective and safe.

      siG12D-LODER has been studied in the escalating dose Phase I study of 15 patients, and
      results showed a high safety and tolerability profiles, with no single DLT.

          -  Men and women patients 18 years of age and up

          -  Have an unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer (AJCC stage III). (Excluded:
             resectable and borderline resectable patients are ineligible per NCCN criteria)

          -  Allocated to receive Gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel as first line treatment.

          -  Have a target tumor that is accessible for intratumoral administration by PTA
             (Percutaneous transluminal approach) or EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound) guidance as
             determined by the radiologist/gastroenterologist performing the PTA/EUS injection.

          -  Have an ECOG performance status of ≤ 1

          -  If female and of childbearing potential, have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test during screening. Agree to use a barrier method of contraception if sexually
             active (both men and women) from the time of administration of the first treatment
             and for at least 8 weeks after treatment.
