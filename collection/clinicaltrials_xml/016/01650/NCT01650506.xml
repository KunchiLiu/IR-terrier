      Extended phase 1 trial of combined metformin and erlotinib in advanced triple negative
      breast cancer patients.

      The goals of the study are to establish the maximum tolerated combined dosing of erlotinib
      and metformin as well as deciding if there is potential clinical utility of the combination
      in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.

    <intervention_name>Metformin</intervention_name>
    <description>Due to frequent GI upset in patients starting metformin the dose will be titrated up to the assigned dose level. The first metformin dose level will be 850 mg twice daily and be escalated to its maximum FDA approved dose of 850 mg three times daily. Dose escalation will follow the standard 3 + 3 design. Dose limiting toxicities will be determined during the first 5 weeks of therapy.</description>

             treatment, are off steroids (if the steroids were part of the CNS disease treatment),
             and in the case of brain metastases, have stable or improved imaging at least 6 weeks
