    <textblock>
      The investigators are asking subjects to take part in a research study of soft tissue (gums)
      and bone (jawbone) healing around dental implants following tooth extraction. The
      investigators want to compare how the gums and the bone changes shape with healing in two
      different scenarios:

        1. When the implant is placed at the same time the tooth is extracted.

        2. When the tooth is extracted and then left to heal for a period of 4 to 8 weeks before
           the implant is placed.

      Previous studies have shown that both methods work and can give good results. In fact the
      two methods are used routinely as part of standard care but it is not known if the two
      procedures are equally good since they have never been compared in one same research study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is 18 years or older.

          2. Ability to understand and provide informed consent before starting the study.

          3. Ability and willingness to comply with all study requirements.

          4. The patient, if of child-bearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test.

          5. Adequate oral hygiene to allow for implant therapy consistent with standards of care.

          6. Adequate bone volume to accommodate the planned endosseous dental implant placement
             following immediate placement protocols utilizing Straumann Bone Level implants RC

          7. One or more teeth in either the maxilla or mandible anterior or premolar areas
