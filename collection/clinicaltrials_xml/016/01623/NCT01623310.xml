      This is an open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety of intranasal
      administration of 400 μg of fluticasone propionate twice a day delivered by the OptiNose
      device in subjects with chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps. The study consists
      of an up-to-7-day pretreatment phase followed a 12-month open-label treatment phase. The
      duration of each subject's participation is approximately 53 weeks.
