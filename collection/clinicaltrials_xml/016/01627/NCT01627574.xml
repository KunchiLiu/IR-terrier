  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objectives of this research are to develop effective treatments to reduce
      unplanned pregnancy and Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for a highly under-served
      population in great need.

      This trial will evaluate a Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention designed to improve
      contraceptive use and decrease STIs for girls involved with the justice system for both
      those who do and do not want a pregnancy. Those interested in becoming pregnant will be
      counseled in the risks associated with teen pregnancy and what it means to have a healthy
      pregnancy and raise a child. The investigators will utilize Title X programs in Rhode Island
      to provide reproductive health services in the community. The investigators will recruit 250
      girls from juvenile probation and randomize them to two interventions: two sessions of
      personalized MI combined with one session of skill building or three sessions of Didactic
      Educational Counseling (DEC), both delivered individually by trained counselors. CAMI is
      based on the principles of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and on MI, an empirically
      supported counseling technique designed to enhance readiness to change targeted behaviors.
      The DEC provides didactic information about contraception, STI prevention and abstinence,
      and is intended to control for the effects of assessment and attention.

    <description>Initiation and Continuous Use of Highly Effective Contraceptives at 3, 6, and 9 Months: A participant switching from one highly effective contraceptive method to another will be recorded as maintaining continuous contraceptive use at follow-up if she switches methods during times when the original method is still effective. Use of contraceptive methods will be assessed through the TLFB. Thus, changes from Baseline to 3, 6, and 9 month follow-ups will will be investigated.</description>

    <description>Incident STIs: At baseline participants will be tested for T. vaginalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and C. trachomatis through self obtained vaginal swabs. If a participant is diagnosed with an STI at baseline she will be referred for treatment at a Title X clinic and will be retested at her next follow-up visit. Any positive test after a baseline negative test will be documented as an incident infection.</description>
