      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Lotus™ Valve
      System for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in symptomatic subjects with severe
      calcific aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for surgical valve replacement.

          -  Subject has documented calcific native aortic valve stenosis

          -  Subject has a documented aortic annulus size between ≥19 and ≤27 mm based on
             pre-procedure diagnostic imaging

          -  Symptomatic aortic valve stenosis with NYHA Functional Class ≥ II

          -  Subject is considered high risk for surgical valve replacement

          -  Heart team assessment that the subject is likely to benefit from valve replacement.

          -  Subject (or legal representative) understands the study requirements and the
             treatment procedures, and provides written informed consent.

          -  Subject, family member, and/or legal representative agree(s) and subject is capable
             of returning to the study hospital for all required scheduled follow up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a congenital unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve.

          -  Subject with an acute myocardial infarction within 30 days of the index procedure

          -  Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the
             past 6 months, or has any permanent neurologic defect prior to study enrollment.

          -  Subject is on dialysis or has serum creatinine level &gt;3.0 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L.

          -  Subject has a pre-existing prosthetic heart valve (aortic or mitral) or a prosthetic
             ring in any position.

          -  subject cannot have more than moderate mitral, aortic or tricuspid regurgitation

          -  Subject has a need for emergency surgery for any reason.

          -  Subject has a history of endocarditis within 12 months of index procedure or evidence
             of an active systemic infection or sepsis.

          -  Subject has echocardiographic evidence of intra-cardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation.

          -  Subject has low Hgb, platelet count or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3, or low white blood cell
             count.

          -  Subject requires chronic anticoagulation therapy and cannot tolerate concomitant
             therapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel/ticlopidine

          -  Subject has active peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleed within the past 3
             months, other bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse transfusions.

          -  Subject has known hypersensitivity to contrast agents that cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated, or has known hypersensitivity to aspirin, all thienopyridines,
             heparin, nickel, tantalum, titanium, or polyurethanes.

          -  Subject has a life expectancy of less than 12 months due to non-cardiac, co-morbid
             conditions based on the assessment of the investigator at the time of enrollment.

          -  Subject has hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

          -  Subject has any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure within 30 days prior to the
             index procedure (except for pacemaker implantation which is allowed).

          -  Subject has untreated coronary artery disease.

          -  Subject has documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%.

          -  Subject is in cardiogenic shock or has hemodynamic instability requiring inotropic
             support or mechanical support devices.

          -  Subject has severe peripheral vascular disease or symptomatic carotid or vertebral
             disease.

          -  Narrow Femoral artery lumen precludes the use of either Lotus device size, or severe
             iliofemoral tortuosity or calcification that would prevent safe placement of the
             introducer sheath.

          -  Current problems with substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, etc.).

          -  Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not
             reached its primary endpoint.

          -  Patient has preexisting untreated conduction system disorder that requires new
             pacemaker implantation.
