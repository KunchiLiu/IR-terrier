  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a three method risk adapted design using induction
      chemotherapy, transoral surgery and radiation chemotherapy will lessen toxic effects and
      make treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) better.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm non-randomized two-stage phase II trial in previously untreated
      patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) arising in the oral
      cavity, oropharynx, or supraglottic larynx amenable to a transoral surgical approach.
      Treatment will consist of 3 parts: neoadjuvant induction with weekly carboplatin and
      paclitaxel in combination with daily lapatinib for 6 weeks (PART 1) prior to transoral
      surgery (PART 2). Post-operative treatment (PART 3) will vary depending on the risk category
      assigned to the patient following surgery as follows: no further treatment or treatment
      limited to involved field radiation (low risk), ipsilateral radiation concurrent with weekly
      chemotherapy ( medium risk); or cisplatin every 3 weeks and daily lapatinib concurrent with
      bilateral radiation (high risk).
