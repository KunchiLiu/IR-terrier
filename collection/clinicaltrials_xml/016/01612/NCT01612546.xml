  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies cyclodextrin-based nanopharmaceutical CRLX101 in treating
      patients with advanced or metastatic stomach, gastroesophageal, or esophageal cancer that
      has progressed through at least one prior regimen of chemotherapy and cannot be removed by
      surgery. CRLX101 delivers the cytotoxic topoisomerase-1 inhibitor camptothecin into tumor
      cells and is hypothesized to interrupt the growth of tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pre- and post-treatment biopsies to assess CRLX101 (cyclodextrin-based
      polymer-camptothecin CRLX101) nanoparticle and 20(S)-Camptothecin (CPT) uptake in tumor and
      normal tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of CRLX101 in this patient population.

      II. To examine the antitumor efficacy of CRLX101 in advanced gastric/gastroesophageal
      junction (GEJ)/esophageal squamous or adenocarcinoma including clinical benefit rate
      (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) at 4 months and
      overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving stable disease or better, may receive treatment for an additional 6
      months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly.
