  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II intervention to propose a new melanoma chemoprevention agent. The
      investigators believe oxidative stress/damage in nevi is a probable indication for melanoma
      risk, and propose that reduced melanoma risk in humans can be inferred by protection of nevi
      from ultraviolet light (UV)-induced oxidative changes. The investigators will 1) evaluate
      whether administration of NAC around the time of UV exposure will reduce melanoma risk in
      high-risk patient populations with genetic susceptibility to UV-induced oxidative stress,
      and 2) examine key genetic variants that will identify which individuals are most likely to
      benefit from chemoprotection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have at least 2 nevi (each &gt;6 mm diameter) not clinically suspicious for
             melanoma that can be biopsied.

          -  Must be able to receive informed consent and sign an approved consent form that
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is a minor (&lt; 18 years old).

          -  The patient cannot speak/understand English or Spanish. (NOTE: A Spanish consent form
             and certified interpreter can be made available if needed)

          -  The patient is pregnant. (NOTE: All female patients who have not had a hysterectomy
             and are not post-menopausal (i.e. post-menopausal for 1 year and not of child-bearing
             potential) will have a urine pregnancy test.)

          -  The patient is a prisoner, critically or mentally ill, or otherwise incapacitated or
             considered vulnerable.

          -  The patient has history of allergic reaction to NAC.

          -  The patient has history of severe asthma.

          -  The patient has been taking NAC or any other oral antioxidant.

          -  The patient has recent history (i.e., 3 months) of sunless tanning (tanning bed) or
             extensive sunburn.
