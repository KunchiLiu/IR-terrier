    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare how the body absorbs and processes two different
      formulations of the anti-rejection medication tacrolimus (Advagraf® or Prograf®) in children
      receiving an organ transplant, and how safe and effective they are over a longer period of
      time.

      This study is for children less than 16 years old. No minimum age has been set, however, to
      be included in this study participants must able to swallow the medication capsules intact.

      Subjects undergoing primary heart, kidney or liver transplantation and meeting the Inclusion
      Criteria and complying with the Exclusion Criteria prior to initiation of tacrolimus therapy
      will be enrolled.

      Subjects will be randomized to treatment with either Advagraf® or Prograf®. The
      randomization will be on a 1:1 basis stratified by organ and centre.

      The study is divided in to two parts:

      Part A: The initial pharmacokinetic part of the study.

      Part B: A long term follow-up of one year. The main objective of Part A of the study is to
      collect PK data following administration of Advagraf® and Prograf® in de novo pediatric
      allograft recipients. Part B allows comparison of the safety and efficacy profiles of
      Advagraf® vs. Prograf® for longer term (52 weeks) post allograft transplantation.

      Part C: Continuation of long-term follow-up (from Day 365 onwards). Patients who have
      completed Part B and to whom continued treatment with Advagraf® is not currently available,
      will be offered participation in a continuation of long-term follow-up Part C. Part C will
      continue until Advagraf® becomes available to these patients or these patients'
      discontinuation, whichever is the earliest.

      This applies to patients in the following countries: Czech Republic, Italy and Poland only.
