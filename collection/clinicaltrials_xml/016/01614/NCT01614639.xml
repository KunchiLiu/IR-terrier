    <textblock>
      We are doing this research study to learn about how acupuncture treatment works. This study
      is being done to look at changes in the brain, NOT to treat pain. We want to learn about
      brain activity during acupuncture. We will look at brain activity when a heating device
      touches the skin of a subject before and after the subject has acupuncture, to see what
      changes.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meet the Classification Criteria of chronic LBP (having low back pain for more than 6
             months), as determined by the referring physician

          -  At least 4/10 clinical pain on the 10-point LBP intensity scale on average during the
             past two weeks prior to enrollment

          -  At least a 10th grade English-reading level; English can be a second language
             provided that the patients feel they understand all the questions used in the
             assessment measures

          -  Must have had a prior evaluation of their low back pain by a health care provider,
             which may include radiographic studies. Documentation of this evaluation will be
             obtained from the subject's medical record

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific causes of back pain (e.g., cancer, fractures, spinal stenosis, infections)

          -  Radicular pain extending below the knee

          -  Complicated back problems (e.g., prior back surgery, medicolegal issues)

          -  Possible contraindications for acupuncture (e.g., coagulation disorders, cardiac
             pacemakers, pregnancy, seizure disorder), and conditions that might confound
             treatment effects or interpretation of results (e.g., severe fibromyalgia, rheumatoid
             arthritis)

          -  Conditions making study participation difficult (e.g., paralysis, psychoses, or other
             severe psychological problems as per the judgment of a study investigator and/or a T
             score &gt; 60 on the psychological measures assessed during Session 1)

          -  Prior acupuncture treatment for back pain; 1 year minimum wait for any condition
             other condition.

          -  Active substance abuse disorder in the past two years, as determined by subject
             self-report.

          -  The intent to undergo surgery during the time of involvement in the study.

          -  History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the
             investigator's judgment, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened
             potential for adverse outcome. For example: asthma or claustrophobia.

          -  Presence of any contraindications to MRI scanning. For example: cardiac pacemaker,
             metal implants, fear of closed spaces, pregnancy.

          -  Unresolved legal/disability/workers compensation claims in connection with low back.

          -  Instability of pain ratings in Session 2 or Session 3.

          -  Use of more than 60 mg prescription opioids or steroids for pain.
