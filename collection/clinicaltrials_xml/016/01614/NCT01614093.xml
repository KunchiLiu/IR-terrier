      The objective of this study is to test a single dose of intranasal oxytocin, compared to
      placebo, in a within subjects, crossover design, to see if oxytocin will improve satiety
      signaling (behaviorally and/or by self report) compared to placebo. If this single dose
      pilot paradigm shows an increase in satiety, it may be tested in follow-up studies as a
      prevention or treatment for weight gain and overeating in people with schizophrenia.

          -  One month of stable antipsychotic treatment (same medication regimen and same dose)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of organic brain disease

          -  DSM-IV diagnosis of Mental Retardation

          -  DSM-IV diagnosis of Alcohol or Substance Dependence within the last six months
             (except nicotine)

          -  DSM-IV diagnosis of Alcohol or Substance Abuse within the last one month (except
             nicotine)

          -  Are pregnant or lactating

          -  Current diagnosis of Type I or II Diabetes defined as a fasting blood glucose level
             of &gt; 99 mg/dL.

          -  Meet DSM-IV criteria for a past and/or current eating disorder via the SCID, or if
             they have a past medical history of an eating disorder, received treatment/counseling
             for an eating disorder and/or required hospitalization for an eating disorder. (If an
             otherwise undiagnosed eating disorder is detected during screening, referral to
             treatment will be provided.)

          -  Are taking weight-loss medications, whether over-the-counter (i.e. Hydroxycut,
             Stacker products, Metabo-Plus, CortiSlim), or prescribed, including appetite
             suppressants (Didrex, Tenuate, Sanorex, Mazanor, Adipex-P, Meridia, and Phentermine)
             and fat-absorption inhibitors (Xenical).

          -  Have cognitive impairment severe enough to preclude informed consent or valid
             responses on questionnaires. This is defined an as a score of less than 10 on the
             Evaluation to Sign Consent (ESC).

          -  Have a medical illness, dietary restrictions, or food allergies that, in the view of
             the investigators, would compromise participation.

          -  Are taking prostaglandins such as dinoprostone or misoprostol (because they interact
             with oxytocin).
