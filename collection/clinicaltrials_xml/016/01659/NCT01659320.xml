    <textblock>
      This research study will examine whether elderly depressed patients whose depressive
      symptoms do not respond satisfactorily to therapy with a mood stabilizer or antidepressant
      alone gain any benefit from taking minocycline alone or in addition to their antidepressant
      or mood stabilizer medication. Minocycline is a commonly used antibiotic medication with
      anti-inflammatory properties. It is hoped that information gained from this study will help
      the investigators better understand the role of inflammation in depression, and whether
      decreasing inflammation will lead to improvement in the symptoms of depression and cognitive
      function.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to provide hypothesis generation data that may later be tested through a placebo controlled trial. Accordingly, we will examine whether minocycline alone or as an augmenting agent of antidepressants or mood stabilizers reduces depressive symptoms and disability and promotes remission of major depression</description>
