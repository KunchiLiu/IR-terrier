  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Fluzone High Dose increases the immune
      response to the influenza antigens contained in the vaccine compared to standard-dose
      Fluzone in immunocompromised children and young adults. Safety and efficacy data will also
      be collected.

    <description>Gathering data on influenza-like-illness during the influenza season for which the subject was vaccinated in the study. Influenza season typically lasts January through May. Compare rates of diagnosed influenza and rates of reported Influenza Like Illness (ILI) from Questionnaire #2 and also obtained from medical records between the high-dose and standard-dose recipients within each patient group for each influenza season included in the study. We will obtain 3 sets of data related to influenza/ILI and analyze combinations of them.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-proven diagnosis of influenza performed at Children's Hospital Colorado (CHC)
Diagnosis of influenza by non-PCR rapid-influenza test (diagnosed outside of main-campus CHC)
Diagnosis of ILI (from questionnaire #2). [Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definition of ILI: Fever ≥ 100°F AND cough or sore throat in the absence of another known cause other than influenza for the illness.]</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in disease status after vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate disease status changes reported by subject on Questionnaire #2 as well as changes reported in clinic notes over the course of the influenza season. Statistical analysis will compare rates of progress or improvement of disease within the 2 months after vaccination and then within 6 months after vaccination between the high-dose and standard-dose recipients within each patient group.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Adverse Events</measure>
