  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label, dose-finding study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of venetoclax (GDC-0199; ABT-199) administered in combination with
      obinutuzumab to participants with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia. All participants (relapsed/refractory and previously untreated) will
      receive 6 cycles of obinutuzumab and venetoclax. After completing combination treatment,
      previously untreated participants will receive single agent venetoclax for at least 6
      additional months (the anticipated time on treatment for previously untreated participants
      is at least 12 months). After completing combination treatment, relapsed/refractory
      participants will continue single agent venetoclax until disease progression.
