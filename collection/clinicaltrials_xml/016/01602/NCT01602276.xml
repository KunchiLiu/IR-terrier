  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) can improve certain abilities related to cognition, emotion and/or physical
      functioning in individuals with subcortical brain damage.

    <textblock>
      While cortical brain structures are thought to be responsible for higher level cognitive
      functioning (i.e., perception, thoughts, language, memory, attention, and processing),
      subcortical brain regions (i.e., amygdala, midbrain, hippocampus, and thalamus) are
      generally believed to be responsible for more fundamental bases of such functions. A
      significant fraction of the population suffer from disabling disorders and diseases (i.e.,
      Parkinson's disease, subcortical dementia, hypoxic brain damage) that affect subcortical
      areas. Despite their prevalence, very little success has been achieved in treating such
      impairments effectively.

      This study has two main goals. One is to examine the effect of stimulation on a variety of
      subcortical functions (i.e., level of alertness, mood, cognition, and motor responding). A
      second goal is to examine the effects of varying some of the stimulus parameters of tDCS,
      notably the placement of the electrodes and the duration and frequency of application of
      current.

      Adult participants with a confirmed diagnosis of subcortical brain damage, as well as
      healthy adults will be randomly assigned to anodal and cathodal stimulation in a
      counterbalanced order, and both will engage in simple behavioral tasks and/or physiological
      monitoring. These tasks will be specific to the deficit of interest.
