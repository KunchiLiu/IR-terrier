      Drugs used as chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy
      with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. This phase II trial studies how well
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy work in treating younger patients with newly diagnosed
      central nervous system germ cell tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine, as measured by the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate and patterns
      of failure, whether dose and volume of irradiation can be safely reduced to 30.6 Gy whole
      ventricular-field irradiation (WVI) plus 23.4 Gy primary site boost instead of 36 Gy
      craniospinal irradiation (CSI) plus primary site boost in the subgroup of children and young
      adults with localized nongerminomatous germ cell tumor (NGGCT) who have a magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and tumor marker criteria (CSF and serum) for confirmed complete response (CR)
      or partial response (PR) to induction chemotherapy and negative serum and cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) tumor markers OR in patients who have less than a PR after induction
      chemotherapy with negative tumor markers who undergo a second-look surgery and are found to
      have only mature teratoma, residual scar or fibrosis, and fit the definition of CR/PR after
      second-look surgery.

      II. To determine, as measured by the 3-year PFS rate and patterns of failure, whether
      simplified chemotherapy followed by dose-reduced radiation therapy is effective for treating
      children and young adults with localized primary central nervous system (CNS) germinoma who
      present with serum and/or CSF human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (hCGβ) =&lt; 50 mIU/mL.

      III. To prospectively evaluate and longitudinally model the cognitive, social, and
      behavioral functioning of children and young adults who are treated with reduced radiation
      dose and volume of irradiation in Stratum 1 (NGGCT) and with dose-reduced radiation therapy
      in Stratum 2 (Germinoma) using the ALTE07C1 protocol (This objective will be assessed
      independently for the two strata).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To estimate the PFS and overall survival (OS) distributions of patients with NGGCT treated
      with 30.6 Gy WVI and involved-field radiation therapy (IFR) focal boost to 54 Gy. II. To
      estimate the PFS and OS distributions of localized-germinoma patients who present with serum
      and/or CSF hCGβ ≤ 50 mIU/mL vs serum and/or CSF hCGβ &gt; 50 mIU/mL and =&lt; 100 mIU/mL.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to localized primary
      disease (nongerminomatous germ cell tumor [NGGCT] vs germinoma).

      Stratum 1 (NGGCT): Patients receive induction therapy comprising carboplatin IV over 15-60
      minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 of courses 1, 3, and 5.
      Patients also receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 of
      courses 2, 4, and 6. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responsive disease (complete [CR] or
      partial response [PR]) to induction chemotherapy undergo radiotherapy once daily (QD) 5 days
      a week for 6 weeks. Patients with PR, stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) and
      normalization of tumor levels undergo second-look surgery. Patients who achieve CR or PR
      after second-look surgery undergo radiotherapy.

      Stratum 2 (Germinoma): Patients receive induction therapy comprising carboplatin IV over
      15-60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with CR or continued CR undergo radiotherapy QD 5 days a week for approximately 4
      weeks. Patients with PR, SD, or PD with normal tumor markers may undergo second-look
      surgery. Patients found to have mature teratoma or non-viable tumor during surgery undergo
      radiotherapy. Patients with PR or SD with residual disease (=&lt; 1.5 cm) and suprasellar (&gt;
      0.5 cm) or pineal (&gt; 1 cm) involvement and normal tumor markers undergo radiotherapy after
      chemotherapy without second-look surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 2 years, and then annually for up to 3 years.
