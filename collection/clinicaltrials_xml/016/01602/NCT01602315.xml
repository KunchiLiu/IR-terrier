  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase Ib dose escalation / Phase II study in recurrent
      or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (RM HNSCC) patients considered to be
      resistant, ineligible or intolerant to platinum-based chemotherapy. The first aim of the
      Phase Ib is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or the Recommended Phase
      II Dose(s) (RP2D(s)) for BYL719 in combination with cetuximab This part will include two
      different arms using two different administration methods of BYL719 tablets together with
      cetuximab as recommended by the label: Arm A - whole tablets will be administered to
      patients able to swallow the tablets vs. Arm B - a drinkable suspension prepared from
      crushed tablets will be administered to patients with swallowing dysfunction. The second aim
      of the Phase Ib is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the new dispersible tablet
      formulation of BYL719 in combination with cetuximab. A third arm will be opened: Arm C,
      which will use a suspension from a dispersible tablet administered via gastric feeding tube
      (G tube). The safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy will be investigated separately in
      the Phase Ib arms. The MTD/RP2D will only be investigated independently for Arm A and B. The
      one of Arm B will be compared to that of Arm A. If the MTD/RP2D is the same, then both
      administration methods of BYL719 may be used in Phase II. If the MTD/RP2D is different, then
      only the administration of BYL719 whole tablets will be allowed in the Phase II. Arm C is an
      independent relative bioavailability study of the new dispersible tablet formulation of
      BYL719, which will begin at the starting dose/RP2D identified with a safety cohort followed
      by an expansion cohort. There will be no dose escalation or de-escalation in this Arm. If
      either the safety or pharmacokinetic profile of the RP2D of 300 mg QD in Arm C is not
      comparable with Arm A, then enrollment in Arm C will cease and the dispersible tablet will
      not be implemented in Phase II.

      The Phase Ib dose escalation part is expected to enroll approximately 12 patients for Arm A
      and B and will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM). The available
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy data, as well as the recommendations from the
      BLRM, are used to determine the dose combination for the next cohort(s). The Phase II part
      of the study will commence upon MTD/RP2D declaration of Arm A in Phase Ib, regardless of the
      progress of Arm B and C.

      The Phase II part will assess the clinical efficacy of BYL719 in combination with cetuximab
      in two patient populations: patients will be assigned to one of two schemes of enrollment
      based on prior therapy with cetuximab.

      Patients considered cetuximab naïve per protocol will be assigned to Scheme 1. The primary
      purpose of this scheme is to assess the anti-tumor activity of BYL719 in combination with
      cetuximab (Arm 1) vs. cetuximab as single-agent (Arm 2) in RM HNSCC patients' naïve to
      cetuximab. Patients in scheme 1 will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio via IRT in two Phase II
      arms: BYL719 in combination with cetuximab (Arm 1) vs. cetuximab as single-agent (Arm 2).
      Patients randomized to Arm 2 (cetuximab monotherapy) will have the opportunity to cross-over
      to combination treatment with BYL719 + cetuximab after experiencing disease progression. Arm
      1 will consist of approximately 66 patients and Arm 2 of approximately 33 patients.

      Patients having received prior cetuximab per protocol will be assigned to Scheme 2. The
      primary purpose of this scheme is to assess the anti-tumor activity of BYL719 in combination
      with cetuximab in RM HNSCC cetuximab resistant patients (Arm 3). Patients in this scheme
      will not be randomized. 40 patients will be enrolled. Phase II will further characterize the
      safety and PK of the drug combination.

      Patients will be treated until progression of disease (except for phase II Arm 2),
      unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first. Patients
      enrolled in Arm 2 experiencing disease progression will have the opportunity to crossover to
      the combination treatment (Arm 2B) and they will continue until they experience unacceptable
      toxicity that precludes any further treatment, until disease progression, and/or until
      treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator or by patient refusal. In
      the follow-up period all patients must complete the safety follow-up assessments 30 days
      after the last dose of the study treatment. Patients who have not progressed at the time of
      discontinuation of study treatment should be radiologically followed for disease status
      until disease progression, initiation of subsequent anticancer therapies, or death,
      whichever occurs first. In addition, all patients enrolled in Phase II will be followed for
      survival.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Patients with histologically/cytologically-confirmed HNSCC

          -  Patients must be resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy, or be ineligible (due to
             medical comorbidities) or intolerant to platinum-based therapy per medical history

          -  For Phase Ib, there is no restriction on the number of prior therapies for recurrent
             or metastatic disease

          -  For Phase II, patients may have received a maximum of 1 prior line of therapy for
