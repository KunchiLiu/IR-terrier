    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ocular iontophoresis
      with dexamethasone phosphate ophthalmic solution EGP-437 using the EyeGate® II Drug Delivery
      System (EGDS) compared to placebo in patients undergoing cataract surgery with implantation
      of a posterior chamber intraocular lens.
