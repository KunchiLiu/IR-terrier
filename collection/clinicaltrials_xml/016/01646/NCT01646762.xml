    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
      works in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has returned or did not respond to
      treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate) of single agent nab-paclitaxel
      (Abraxane) (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the adverse events associated with use of single agent nab-paclitaxel
      (Abraxane) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To evaluate overall survival, time to progression, and duration of response among
      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma undergoing treatment with single agent
      nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.

    <description>A confirmed partial response or better is defined to be a stringent complete response, complete response, very good partial response, or partial response (PR) noted as the objective status on two consecutive evaluations. The proportion of successes (confirmed PR or better) will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated using the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to disease progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from registration to the earliest date of documentation of disease progression, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of time to progression will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Several estimates of time to progression, such as 3 and 6 month progression-free rates will be provided. Furthermore, analyses will include censoring patients for progression at their first disease assessment after completion of treatment, in order to provide a more conservative estimate of time to progression by removing any bias present from the patient's receiving subsequent and off-study treatment(s).</description>

    <time_frame>Date at which the patient's earliest best objective status is first noted to be at least a partial response or better to the earliest date progression is documented, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of duration of response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration.</description>
