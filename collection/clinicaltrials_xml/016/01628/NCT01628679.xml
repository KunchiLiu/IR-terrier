      Hypothesis:

        1. Specific physiotherapy interventions will decrease pain, improve pelvic floor motor
           control, increase self efficacy, improve sexual function and decrease pain
           catastrophizing behaviour in women with provoked vulvar vestibulodynia.

           This study will look at specific physiotherapy treatment interventions to see if they
           decrease pain, improve pelvic floor motor control, increase self efficacy, improve
           sexual function and decrease pain catastophizing behaviour. Participants will fill out
           a questionnaire on their pain symptoms and complete standardized scales prior to
           starting treatment and after 4 sessions to determine change due to interventions.

        2. A combination of physiotherapy, group educational sessions and group cognitive
           behavioural therapy will have better outcomes than physiotherapy alone.

      Results of physiotherapy intervention alone will be compared to results of those treated
      with physiotherapy, group educational sessions and group cognitive behavioural therapy at a
      separate treatment centre. Physiotherapy interventions and outcome measures are the same
      between both groups.

      Justification:

      Standard treatment is hard to identify as many approaches are taken, none with any evidence
      to support them. This study aims to look at specific techniques (pelvic floor coordination
      and relaxation exercises, education on female sexual response and pain pathophysiology
      education) to see if there is a benefit.

    <description>Subjects will be given pelvic floor motor control,proprioception and relaxation exercises. This will be with and without the use of external surface Electromyography (EMG) biofeedback. Education will also be given on pain management, female sexual response and vestibulodynia. Subjects will also practice inserting vaginal inserts of graduating diameter into their vaginas, practicing the skills learned in physical therapy sessions.</description>
