  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a viral agent called
      vesicular stomatitis virus for the use in patients with liver cancer. The study virus has a
      gene inserted into it which will allow for the production of interferon beta, which is a
      substance that will have the dual functions of restricting the spread of the virus to the
      tumor cells and not healthy liver cells and also to have some independent anti-cancer
      activity. Although the primary goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of delivery of
      this viral agent to people, patients may benefit clinically by having shrinkage or
      stabilization of their tumor or reduction in their cancer related symptoms (e.g. pain). -

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vesicular stomatitis virus
      (VSV)-interferon beta (IFN-beta) (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing
      interferon beta) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) refractory or intolerant to
      sorafenib therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the tumor response rate and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VSV-IFN-beta in patients with HCC by
      measurement of VSV-IFN-beta in blood by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR).

      II. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFN-beta by way of measuring serum
      interferon-beta and also VSV-RT-PCR of VSV-IFN-beta listed above.

      III. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-hIFN-beta specific) and natural killer (NK)
      cell responses.

      IV. Assess status of human interferon beta pathway pre/post therapy in tumor/normal liver
      tissue (status of IFN-beta, interferon stimulated gene factor 3 [ISGF3 complex constituting
      signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/2 and p48 (ISGF3 Î³)]).

      V. Assess phosphorylation of STAT1/2 post-therapy. VI. Evaluate transcription of interferon
      mediated genes (protein kinase R, the death receptor-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-related
      apoptosis-inducing ligand [TRAIL], 2'-5' oligoadenylate/ribonucleic acid [RNA]se L proteins,
      heat shock proteins [Hsp 60/70/90], major histocompatibility class antigens and interferon
      regulatory factor [IRF]-7).

      VII. Assess presence of VSV in tumor/normal liver subsequent to administration of VSV-human
      IFN-beta (hIFN- beta).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing interferon beta
      intratumorally on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 3 years.

    <time_frame>From the start of the treatment until disease progression, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Responses will be summarized by simple descriptive summary statistics delineating complete and partial responses as well as stable and progressive disease in this patient population (overall and by dose level).

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events, graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s). The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed by dose level to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. Examined in an exploratory and hypothesis-generating fashion.</description>

    <measure>MTD, defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1/6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicities (DLT), graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DLT defined as an adverse event during the first 4 weeks following injection. A modified &quot;3+3&quot; Fibonacci dose escalation scheme will be used Examined in an exploratory and hypothesis-generating fashion.</description>
