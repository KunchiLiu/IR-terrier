      This study aims to evaluate whether vitamin D receptor agonist therapy (calcitriol) in
      diabetes lowers renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity in a manner similar to an ACE
      inhibitor. This is a physiology study, focused on evaluating hormonal changes in the
      circulating and tissue RAS when compared to placebo.

      Subjects with type 2 diabetes and obesity and normal kidney function will undergo evaluation
      of their circulating and renal-vascular RAS activity and urinary protein at baseline, after
      withdrawing interfering medications, while on a controlled electrolyte diet, and in
      controlled posture settings. They will then randomly receive a study medication (calcitriol
      or placebo) for 3 weeks followed by a re-assessment of their RAS parameters. The main
      outcomes that will be evaluated following calcitriol/placebo include measures of the
      circulating RAS (primary), as well as measures of the renal-vascular RAS, urine protein,
      adipocytokine levels, and adipose-tissue RAS activity (secondary)

      In an extension phase, Lisinopril will be added to the study drug for another 2 weeks
      followed by another assessment of the primary and secondary outcome parameters, and subjects
      will continue lisinopril+study drug for 3 additional months for one final assessment of RAS
      parameters and urinary protein.
