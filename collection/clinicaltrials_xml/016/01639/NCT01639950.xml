      Background:

      - Assessing pain levels is important to improve treatments for different illnesses. Most
      pain rating scales are used to determine pain levels in adults. Pain is also a common
      symptom among children who have cancer. Those who have genetic conditions that may lead to
      cancer may also have pain symptoms. However, the pain scales used for adults have not been
      fully tested in children and young adults. As a result, they may not be as accurate.
      Researchers want to test pain rating scales in children and young adults who have cancer and
      genetic conditions that can lead to cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To study the effectiveness of pain rating scales given to children and young adults with
      cancer and related genetic conditions.

      Eligibility:

        -  Children, adolescents, and young adults between 6 and 25 years of age who have cancer
           or other genetic conditions that can lead to cancer.

        -  Parents of participating children will also be eligible.

      Design:

        -  Participants with cancer or related genetic conditions will fill out four
           questionnaires. These questionnaires will ask about pain levels and how much pain
           interferes with daily life.

        -  Parents will fill out two questionnaires about their child s pain levels and how much
           pain interferes with the child s life.

        -  Pain treatments will not be provided as part of this study.

      BACKGROUND:

      Pain is a common symptom among children with a variety of medical illnesses. Currently, a
      number of rating scales are used to assess pain interference and pain severity in adults.
      However, relatively few measures assessing these variables have been validated for use with
      children and adolescents, and existing tools have limitations.

      OBJECTIVES:

      The primary objective is to validate the self-report and parent versions of the Pain
      Interference Index (PII) and the Pain Rating Scale (PRS) by comparison with previously
      validated measures of pain interference (Modified Brief Pain Inventory) and pain
      severity(Faces Pain Scale - Revised) in children, adolescents, and young adults ages 8 to 25
      years with cancer, neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), or other genetic tumor predisposition
      syndromes (GTPS), and their parents, and in adults with cancer, NF1, GTPS, or Sickle Cell
      Disease (SCD). Secondary objectives include collecting data on the reliability of the PII
      and PRS, establishing normative data, and determining the feasibility of using the PII and
      PRS with children ages 6 and 7 years.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Eligible pediatric participants must:

        1. Have a diagnosis of NF1, GTPS, leukemia, or malignant solid tumor (including sarcoma,
           neuroblastoma or melanoma) and be 6 25 years of age, and enrolled on an NCI clinical
           trial or natural history study, with a parent or guardian willing to complete the
           corresponding parent measures

           OR

        2. Have a diagnosis of cancer, NF1, GTPS, or Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), 18 years of age or
           older, seen at the NIH.

      DESIGN:

      Fifty-four patients with solid tumor, NF1 or leukemia ages 8 to 25 and up to 108 parents of
      these patients, and 69 patients with SCD will be asked to respond one time to the PII and
      the PRS, as well as the Modified Brief Pain Inventory and Faces Pain Scale - Revised during
      a scheduled clinic visit for their primary NCI protocol, or while inpatient. In addition,
      demographic (patient gender and age, parent gender (if applicable) and medical (diagnosis,
      date of diagnosis, pain medication) data will be collected from review of the patients
      medical record. Parents of participating patients will be asked to complete the Parent
      version of the PII and the Parent PRS.

      Correlations between patient and parent questionnaire results for patients with solid tumor,
      NF1, GTPS, and leukemia will be correlated to establish validity and reliability of the PII
      and PRS.

      Also, results from mother and father reports will be correlated to assess inter-rater
      reliability.

      Data on up to 12 patients ages 6 and 7 years will be collected to determine the feasibility
      of the forms in this younger age group. A subset of evaluable patients with SCD (n=28) will
      be asked to repeat the PII after approximately 1 month to assess test-retest reliability in
      this tool.
