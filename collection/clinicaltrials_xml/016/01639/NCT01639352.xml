    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this clinical trial is that hepatocellular carcinomas contain somatostatin
      receptors which make them sensitive to the inhibitory effects of a new somatostatin analog,
      SOM230. This analog has greater and broader binding affinity to somatostatin receptors
      compared to the current drug in use, sandostatin LAR. Thus, SOM230 has the potential to be
      more effective in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
