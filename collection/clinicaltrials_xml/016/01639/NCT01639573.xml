  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II pilot trial seeks to demonstrate that prolonged administration of Campath-1H
      without prior marrow or stem cell harvesting can result in immunoablation similar to that
      achieved by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from either bone marrow or
      peripheral blood stem cell sources in children and adolescents with severe treatment
      refractory systemic sclerosis (SSc).

      Patients, 8 to18 years of age, will be included if they have a proven diagnosis of diffuse
      cutaneous or systemic SSc as defined by the ACR criteria with evidence of active
      inflammatory disease Plus at least 1 of the following:SSc-related pulmonary disease with
      forced vital capacity (FVC) or hemoglobin-adjusted DLCO &lt; 70% and evidence of alveolitis by
      high-resolution CT scan or bronchoalveolar lavage.

    <description>Pediatric patients with dcSSc are eligible for the clinical trial if they fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are based upon those of the SCOT trial for adult dcSSc patients, which is the Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States comparing autologous HSCT to monthly high dose cyclophosphamide (CY) alone.</description>

        Patients, 8 to18 years of age, will be included if they have a proven diagnosis of diffuse

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  SSc-related pulmonary disease with forced vital capacity (FVC) or hemoglobin-adjusted
             DLCO &lt; 70% and evidence of alveolitis by high-resolution CT scan or bronchoalveolar
             lavage

          -  History of SSc-related renal crisis or disease, not active at the time of screening

          -  Moderate to severe upper and/or lower gastrointestinal involvement.

          -  Unacceptable toxicity or steroid dependence &gt; 0.3 mg/kg/d,

          -  Failure to respond to, or unacceptable toxicity of MTX &gt; 1mg/kg in combination with
             cyclosporine or azathioprine or cyclophosphamide 2 kg/d or Rituximab 375 mg/m2 x 4
             doses or Imatinib 800 mg/d,

          -  Disease recurrence after tapering medication above

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  SSc patients, who fulfill the modified SCOT criteria, will be assessed for residual
             thymic function since our previous study of pediatric SSc patients demonstrated that
             the SSc patients had decreased thymic function as compared to age matched controls as
             measured by either TREC analysis or the number of naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD4+,
             CD31+).

          -  Patients with less than 50 CD3+, CD4+, CD45RA+, CD31+ cells/ul will be excluded

             immune ablation.

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension

          -  End-stage renal disease (GFR&lt;50 ml/min/1.73 m2 or creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl; estimated
             CrCl &lt; 40 mL/min or active, untreated SSc renal crisis at time of enrollment.

          -  Active hepatitis (ALT, AST, or bilirubin &gt; 2x ULN) or periportal fibrosis by liver
             biopsy

          -  Active gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE, &quot;watermelon stomach&quot;)

          -  Myelodysplasia

          -  Malignancy within the previous 2 years, excluding treated skin cancer

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis B or C, HIV

          -  ANC &lt; 1500 cells/µL, platelets &lt; 120,000 cells/µL, Hct &lt; 27% or Hgb &lt; 9.0 g/dL

          -  History of hypersensitivity to murine or E. coli proteins

          -  Pregnancy or unwilling to use contraceptive methods for at least 15 months

          -  Steroid dependence : &gt; 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent within 30 days prior to
             treatment

          -  History of substance abuse within the last 5 years
