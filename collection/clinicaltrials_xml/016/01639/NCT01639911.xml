    <textblock>
      This phase I dose escalation study will evaluate alisertib, an Aurora A kinase inhibitor,
      when given in combination with the selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      (VEGFR) inhibitor pazopanib in patients with advanced, previously treated non-hematologic
      solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alisertib is taken orally twice a day for the 1st 7 days of a 21 day cycle. Pazopanib is
      taken orally once a day continuously beginning on day 10 of cycle 1 to allow for alisertib
      pharmacokinetics (PKs). Treatment continues until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or patient refusal. PKs will be done on all patients in association with the last
      dose of alisertib cycles 1 and 2.
