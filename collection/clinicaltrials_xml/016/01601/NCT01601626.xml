  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a rapidly-growing need to identify evidence-based, safe, and effective co-treatment
      regimens for HIV-related tuberculosis (TB) among patients who require protease
      inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy. This study will compare three alternative
      co-treatment options among participants in high TB endemic resource-constrained settings, in
      which one co-treatment option explores if an additional anti-HIV drug needs to be used when
      patients are being treated with a protease inhibitor together with rifabutin-based anti-TB
      treatment.

      Accrual will take place in two accrual periods. Accrual period 1 will enroll 60 participants
      who will undergo an initial dose-finding period before continuing regular study follow-up.
      Once the review of the dose-finding pharmacokinetic and safety data from accrual period 1
      participants is completed, accrual period 2 will begin.

             prior to the current TB episode at study entry, or incomplete treatment for a prior

             episode.

          -  Documented multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) or extensively drug-resistant
