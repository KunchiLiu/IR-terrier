      The investigators are attempting to determine if Volume imaging (a new type of ultrasound
      imaging)can accurately diagnose injuries of the muscle ligaments, tendons and bones when
      compared to conventional ultrasound imaging.

    <description>Determine if volume imaging can accurately diagnose muscle, bone and tendon injuries when compared to conventional x-ray scan.
The goal of the study is to determine if a diagnosis can be provided by reviewing a 3D data set of ultrasound images that are focused at a patient's site of maximal symptoms. The hypothesis was whether this simple technique using innovative 3D imaging could replace the more time-consuming manual scanning of a patient's extremity.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 13 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>5 to 10 minutes to complete a conventional ultrasound scan and up to 3 minutes to complete a volume imaging ultrasound scan. Both scans were done on the same day. For all scanned patients, the ultrasound technologist took a volume of images focusing where the patient had symptoms. The study PI reviewed the images, then went back in to do second scan. We found in every case that there was no value so we immediately scrapped the project.</description>
