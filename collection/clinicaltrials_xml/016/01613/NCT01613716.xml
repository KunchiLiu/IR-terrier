      This study will examine the use of the dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) in patients with
      macular edema associated with an epiretinal or preretinal membrane requiring surgical
      intervention. After the surgery is performed (pars plana vitrectomy), an Ozurdex implant
      will be placed in the eye. Patients will be followed for 1 year.

      The purpose of this study to examine the use of Ozurdex in patients who are undergoing pars
      plana vitrectomy for macular edema due to preretinal membranes. Specifically, we will
      examine its effect on macular edema (measured by OCT), and visual recovery (measured by
      visual acuity). We will examine its use in patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy for
      macular edema with associated taut membrane. This will be a prospective pilot study with
      patients to receive an Ozurdex implant at the time of vitrectomy.
