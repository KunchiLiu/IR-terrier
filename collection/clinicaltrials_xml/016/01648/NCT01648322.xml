    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, dose finding, open label, positive controlled Phase II
      study of the efficacy and safety of once-per-cycle of F-627 compared with Neulasta®
      (pegfilgrastim) in women with breast cancer who are receiving myelotoxic TC chemotherapy
      (Taxotere (docetaxel) + cyclophosphamide).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various single
      cycle doses of F-627 as compared with the standard dosing of Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) in
      breast cancer patients experiencing myelotoxic chemotherapy. Myelotoxicity in this study
      will be defined by the duration of moderate neutropenia; the number of days in which the
      patient has had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1.0 × 10^9/L during the first cycle of
      their chemotherapy treatment (each chemotherapy cycle is expected to last 21 days). This, by
      definition, includes grade 3 (moderate) and grade 4 (severe) neutropenia. Doses of F-627 to
      be tested are 80 µg/kg/dose, 240 µg/kg/dose, and 320 µg/kg/dose.

    <time_frame>Measured for each of the 4, 21 day chemotherapy cycles.</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of Grade 3 &amp; Grade 4 neutropenia will be measured for each patient during each chemotherapy cycle administered (up to 4 cycles, each cycle is expected to last 21 days). The duration of Grade 3 &amp; 4 neutropenia is expected to be between days 4-10 (on average) during each chemotherapy cycle. Grade 3 neutropenia is when a patient's ANC &lt; 1.0 × 10^9/L, Grade 4 neutropenia is when a patient's ANC &lt; .5 × 10^9/L</description>

    <description>The incidence rate of febrile neutropenia for each arm of the study will be recorded for 4 chemotherapy cycles. Each cycle is expected to last 21 Days.</description>

    <measure>The duration of total grade 2 neutropenia</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for each of the 4, 21 day chemotherapy cycles.</time_frame>
    <description>After randomization, the duration of time for which grade 2 neutropenia (ANC &lt; 1.5 × 109/L) occurs for each 21 day chemotherapy cycle will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The time to ANC recovery post nadir</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for each of the 4, 21 day chemotherapy cycles.</time_frame>
    <description>The time to ANC recovery post nadir for each patient, for each of their chemotherapy cycles will be recorded; recovery for this protocol is defined as achieving an ANC ≥ 2.0 × 10^9/L after the expected ANC nadir (expected nadir is typically 4-6 days post chemotherapy administration). Each chemotherapy cycle is expected to last 21 days.</description>
