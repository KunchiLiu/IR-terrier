  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile of daratumumab when given in
      combination with Lenalidomide and dexamethasone in participants with relapsed or relapsed
      and refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in two parts. The dose escalation portion of the trial (Part 1)
      participants are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of daratumumab in
      combination with Len/Dex in 28 day treatment cycles. Part 2, the cohort expansion part of
      the trial, will further explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (or the maximum tested
      dose) of daratumumab as determined in Part 1.

    <description>Objective response rate (ORR) will be measured using the international uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma. ORR is defined as the number of participants with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period. The subcategories of ORR are complete response, stringent complete response, very good partial response, partial response, minimal response, and stable disease. ORR is sum of complete and partial responses.</description>

    <intervention_name>Part 1 (Dose Escalation): Daratumumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will receive intravenous (injection of a substance into a vein) infusion of daratumumab in an increased fashion from 2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) up to maximum dose of 16 mg/kg. Considering the safety and efficacy of dose in Part 1, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Part 2 of the study will be decided. A predose infusion of 10 percent (%) of the full dose of daratumumab will be administered a day before the first full infusion of the first cycle. Participants will receive 4 weekly infusions in the first 2 treatment cycles. From cycles 3 to 6 infusions will be administered every alternate week and monthly infusions will be administered from cycle 7 until disease progression.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (Part 1) Have relapsed multiple myeloma after receiving a minimum of 2 and a maximum
             of 4 prior lines of therapy and be eligible for treatment with lenalidomide and
             dexamethasone (Len/Dex)

          -  (Part 2) Have received at least 1 prior line of therapy for multiple myeloma

          -  Be older than or be 18 years of age

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0-2)

          -  Provide signed informed consent after receipt of oral and written information about
             the study and before any study-related activity is performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have previously received an allogenic stem cell transplant

          -  Have received autologous stem cell transplant within 12 weeks before the first
             infusion

          -  Have received antimyeloma treatment, radiotherapy, or any experimental drug or
             therapy within 2 weeks before the first infusion

          -  Have discontinued lenalidomide due to any treatment-related adverse event or be
             refractory to any dose of lenalidomide. Refractory to lenalidomide is defined as
             either, participants whose disease progresses within 60 days of lenalidomide, or
             participants whose disease is nonresponsive while on any dose of lenalidomide.
             Nonresponsive disease is defined as either failure to achieve at least an minimal
             response (MR) or development of progressive disease (PD) while on lenalidomide
