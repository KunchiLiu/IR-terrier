      Primary: Demonstrate reduced frequency and intensity of maladaptive behaviors as measured by
      the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Irritability subscale in subjects given Nuedexta 8
      weeks over subjects given placebo.

      Secondary: Demonstrate a trend towards reduced aggressive behavior as measured by Overt
      Aggression Scale (OAS).

      This is a randomized placebo-controlled crossover study. The parents, neuropsychologists,
      clinical research coordinator (CRC) and PI will be blinded as to whether subjects are on
      placebo or Nuedexta.

      Nuedexta will be given once daily for 7 days. If well-tolerated, it will be given every 12
      hours for the next 7 weeks. Patients may also remain on the once-daily dose if desired.

      The study will last 44 weeks. This includes 20 weeks for study enrollment, 8 weeks of
      treatment/placebo, 4 weeks for washout, and a second 8 week-period of treatment/placebo
      followed by 4 weeks of washout.

      Subjects will be randomized to 8 weeks of Nuedexta/placebo. After the 8 week follow-up
      visit, there will be a 4 week washout period. At week 12 (second baseline), the groups will
      crossover for another 8 weeks of Nuedexta/placebo. Study endpoints will be measured in the
      both groups at weeks 8, 12, and 20. A final study visit will occur at week 24.
