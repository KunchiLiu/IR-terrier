    <textblock>
      This study continues to develop and refine best practices in the delivery of vocational
      services to veterans with histories of felony convictions and mental health/substance abuse
      difficulties. There are currently over 225,000 incarcerated veterans and it is estimated
      64,000 veterans are released from prisons annually. These veterans encounter significant
      difficulties in finding employment due to stigma, intrapersonal difficulties, and out-dated
      work skills. Additionally these veterans are more likely to be homeless than other
      population., Previous work has found that manual based, vocational groups led by trained
      vocational staff led to quicker employment compared to traditional vocational services and
      manual based self studies. To attempt to improve on previous results, this study adds
      principles and components of supported employment including ongoing follow-up, treatment
      team coordination, and community based assistance.
