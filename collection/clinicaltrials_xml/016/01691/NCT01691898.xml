    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of pinatuzumab
      vedotin (DCDT2980S) or polatuzumab vedotin (DCDS4501A) in combination with rituximab (RTX),
      as well as a combination of polatuzumab vedotin with obinutuzumab in participants with
      relapsed or refractory follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and relapsed/refractory
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

In the absence of any infusion-related adverse events, RTX and polatuzumab may be administered on the same day (Day 1) in subsequent cycles beginning with the third cycle. Participants who develop disease progression would be further treated with RTX 375 mg/m^2 followed by pinatuzumab vedotin 2.4 mg/kg IV infusion on Day 1, beginning no later than 42 days after the last dose of the prior study treatment until a second disease progression event relative to the tumor assessment, documenting progressive disease on the initial study treatment, clinical deterioration, and/or intolerance to the crossover treatment for up to a maximum of 1 year (17 cycles on an every-21-day schedule).</description>
