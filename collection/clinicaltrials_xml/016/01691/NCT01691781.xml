      This study will evaluate whether commonly used blood pressure medications called &quot;ACE
      inhibitors&quot; can lower parathyroid hormone.

      The RAAS-PARC study will evaluate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)
      can lower parathyroid hormone (PTH) in normal controls and in individuals have a diagnosis
      of primary hyperparathyroidism.

      Emerging data has implicated the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity with
      increased PTH. The principal investigator, and other investigators, have previously shown
      that inhibiting the RAAS may lower PTH. The current study will focus on:

        1. Normal Physiology: Does an ACEi (which lowers angiotensin II and aldosterone) reduce
           PTH in normal individuals?

        2. Pathophysiology: Does an ACEi reduce PTH in individuals with primary
           hyperparathyroidism?

      The results of this study may have important implications for cardiovascular and skeletal
      health, as both the RAAS and PTH have been implicated as mediators of these conditions.
