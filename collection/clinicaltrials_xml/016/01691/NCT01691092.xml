      This study is designed to look at that involvement of a process in the brain called the
      glutamate system in depression. Participants will undergo a screening session, up to two
      fMRI scans, and up to three PET scans, as well as cognitive testing at each scan session.
      For one of the PET scans, a drug (either ketamine or n-acetyl cysteine) will be
      administered.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize administration of ketamine or n-acetylcysteine
      (NAC) will lead to a decrease in mGluR5.

      Hypothesis 2: The investigators hypothesize an improvement in memory and attentional skills
      after drug challenge.

      Hypothesis 3: The investigators hypothesize an increase in mGluR5 availability and change in
      MRI measures post drug challenge as compared to baseline, signifying synaptogenesis.

      Hypothesis 4: We expect there should not be a significant difference in reduction in mGluR5
      availability due to differences in ABP688 radiotracer infusion.

      Aim 1: To determine the acute effect of medication-induced glutamate release on mGluR5
      availability in human subjects. Hypothesis 1: We hypothesize administration of ketamine or
      n-acetylcysteine (NAC) will lead to a decrease in mGluR5 availability.

      Aim 2: To determine if glutamate release via administration of ketamine or NAC has pro
      cognitive benefits.

      Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize an improvement in memory and attentional skills after drug
      challenge.

      Aim 3: To determine if there is synaptogenesis detectable by PET and MRI post ketamine or
      NAC within a week of drug challenge (at the time of greatest antidepressant response).
      Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize an increase in mGluR5 availability and change in MRI measures,
      post drug challenge as compared to baseline, signifying synaptogenesis.

      Aim 4: To determine if there is a difference in reduction of mGluR5 availability after
      ketamine administration when radiotracer is administered bolus as compared to bolus to
      constant infusion in the same subjects (ABP688 radiotracer only).

      Hypothesis 4: We expect there should not be a significant difference in reduction in mGluR5
      availability due to differences in ABP688 radiotracer infusion.
