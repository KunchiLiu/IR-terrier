    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in nursing home residents, and
      bacteriuria is the greatest trigger for antimicrobial therapy in the nursing home setting.
      The primary aim of this study is to test the efficacy of two oral cranberry capsules per day
      in the reduction of bacteriuria plus pyuria in female nursing home residents. These aims
      will be accomplished by conducting a double blind randomized placebo controlled efficacy
      trial of two oral cranberry capsules daily versus placebo in a cohort of Connecticut female
      nursing home residents.
