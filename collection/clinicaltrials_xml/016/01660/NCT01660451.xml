    <textblock>
      The objective of the study (part A) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BAY80-6946 in
      patients with indolent or aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, who have progressed after
      standard therapy. 30 patients will be enrolled to both indolent and aggressive disease
      group. The objective of the study part B is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      BAY80-6946 in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. 120 patients will be
      enrolled in the part B of the study. Further objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics
      and biomarkers. Quality of life will be a further objective of part B of the study.

      In a cohort of 20 patients (enrolled both in part A and B) an ECG substudy will be performed
      to assess the potential for cardiac toxicity and QT/QTc interval prolongation of BAY80-6946.

      After an up to 28-day screening period, eligible patients will start treatment with
      BAY80-6946 at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg (Part A) and at a dose of 60 mg (Part B).

      Treatment will be continued until disease has progressed or until another criterion is met
      for withdrawal from study. An end-of-treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after
      discontinuation of study treatment. Thirty to 35 days after last study drug administration,
      a safety followup visit will be performed for the collection of adverse events (AEs) and
      concomitant medication data. Patients will be contacted quarterly to determine overall
      survival status up to 3 years after last patient first treatment. In Part B, patients will
      enter the Active Assessment Followup Period. The end of study notification to Health
      Authorities will be based on the completion of the collection of survival data.

      The efficacy is measured by the decrease in tumor size. Tumor assessments will be done at
      Screening, every 8 weeks during Year 1, every 12 weeks during Year 2, and every 6 months
      during Year 3. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Archival tumor
      tissue and blood samples will be collected for biomarker analysis (mandatory) and for
      central pathology review (part B), fresh biopsy tissue will also be collected if available.
