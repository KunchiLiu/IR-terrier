      The purpose of this study is to assess the 4-site &quot;one-week&quot; post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
      regimen as a possible alternative to the 2-site updated Thai Red Cross (TRC) PEP regimen.

      Primary objective:

        -  To demonstrate that PEP using the new &quot;one-week, 4-site&quot; (4-4-4-0-0) intradermal PEP
           regimen (with and without rabies immunoglobulin), is non-inferior to PEP using the
           updated TRC (2-2-2-0-2) ID PEP regimen with rabies immunoglobulin in terms of
           seroprotection rate at Day 14.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe the immune response in each group at Day 0, Day 14 and Day 90.

        -  To describe rabies virus-neutralizing antibody persistence during the 5 years after
           completion of PEP in each group.

        -  To describe the immune response induced by a single-visit 4-site intradermal (ID)
           booster vaccination in each group at Year 5.

        -  To describe the safety profile of each treatment group after the primary and booster
           vaccinations.

      Study participants will receive either Verorab®, with or without Favirab®, according to WHO
      categorization of contacts, depending on the group allocation, from Day 0 to 28, and a
      booster vaccine at 5 years post-primary vaccination.
