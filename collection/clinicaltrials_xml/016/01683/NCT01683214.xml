  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting this study to test the usefulness of a new type of analysis
      of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings called brain network activation or BNA. BNA
      allows to identify patterns of activation in brain networks and to track their changes over
      time. The investigators want to examine the possible role of brain network activation (BNA)
      in the diagnosis of mood disorders and predicting improvement over time. The procedure
      conducted with patients diagnosed with a mood disorder will be compared to people who do not
      have a mood disorder.

    <textblock>
      Novel approach to ascertain use of BNA strategy and technology for the use in confirming
      diagnosis and predicting effect of specific treatment(s)in the various stages of
      affective/mood disorders. The goal is to develop non-invasive technology to confirm
      diagnosis via biological outcomes, and to study the preliminary data of predicting
      response/non-response to specific interventions before clinical effects are shown.
