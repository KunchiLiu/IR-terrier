  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain genetic factors can affect a patient's potential sensitivity to therapeutic drugs
      and other agents. There is a factor called ISG15 which might help doctors better identify
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors may be more sensitive
      to the drug called Irinotecan. This factor is elevated in roughly 30% of NSCLC cases.
      Irinotecan is an agent that inhibits the enzyme called topoisomerase I that is involved in
      cell growth, and it has been FDA approved for 17 years for another type of cancer.

      The goal of this trial is to demonstrate the potential clinical benefit of targeted
      irinotecan chemotherapy in NSCLC patients whose tumors display a specific phenotype that is
      associated with increased sensitivity to this drug, ISG15H.

    <time_frame>Up to 100 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression will be measured from the time of first treatment until there is evidence of progressive disease or death, from the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 100 months. Death will be treated as a progression event.</description>

    <measure>Retrospectively evaluate the role of tumor SULF2 gene methylation status in treatment efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who have a loss of SULF2 gene expression have a better outcome than those whose tumors express SULF2. High level of ISG15 expression in NSCLC may indicate a subgroup of tumors that may be more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of irinotecan. In patients who consent to screening, 10 unstained slides of archived diagnostic tissue will be obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens and analyzed in the laboratories of our Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute co-investigators.</description>
