      The purpose of this research is to determine if a patient's own bone marrow tissue can help
      regenerate bone in the area of the jaw where an implant will be placed. The name of the
      process is called Bone Repair Cell (BRC) Therapy. A sample of bone marrow tissue will be
      collected and sent to a laboratory where it will be processed to form more cells. These new
      cells will then be transplanted in the regenerative site. The researchers are testing to see
      if these cells (BRC) will help form bone. The research will also determine if the implant
      will be more stable in the area with new bone growth.

      Up to 20 (twenty) subjects who have alveolar defects secondary to clefts (n=10) or trauma
      (n=10), will be selected to participate in this study. Among the 20 patients, a total of up
      to 60 defect sites will be evaluated for bone regeneration following therapy, with each
      subject being evaluated in from one to four sites. Once enrolled, subjects from each of the
      two groups (cleft or trauma) will be randomly assigned to receive one of two possible
      treatments, traditional autogenous bone grafting or cell therapy (ixmyelocel-T)

    <description>iliac bone marrow aspirates are expanded ex vivo to enrich for adult multipotent cells (ixmyelocel-T) capable of regenerating bone and blood vessels and reducing inflammation. Following cell expansion, autologous ixmyelocel-T is then packaged and can be used as an autologous graft for treatment of bone defects.</description>

          -  Laboratory values that will define normal renal and hepatic function, as well as
             criteria for exclusion of metabolic bone disease are consistent with those
             established by the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS).

             glycosylated hemoglobin [HA1C &gt; 7%})

          -  Cancer - The explicit definition of cancer used to exclude patients is consistent
             with that described by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of
             Health. According to NCI, cancer is any disease in which abnormal cells divide
             without control and invade nearby tissues (invasive disease). These include
             carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, and lymphomas. Any patient with a history of these
             invasive diseases will be excluded from the study.

             metabolic bone disease including osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures will be
             excluded. The following scale will be used to determine osteoporosis in patients who
             have had a bone mass density (BMD determination: Normal = T score at or above -1.0
             standard deviation [SD]); Osteopenia = T score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD; Osteoporosis
             = T score at or below -2.5 SD.

          -  Pregnant women- Female patients who are of childbearing potential are excluded except
             those who are using hormonal or barrier methods of birth control (oral or parenteral
             contraceptives, diaphragm plus spermicide, or condoms). Pregnancy status will be
             determined with a urine test and patients who are pregnant, as determined by a
             positive test, will be excluded from the study

          -  Patients with congenital or metabolic bone disorders

          -  Subjects with co-morbid conditions that would affect the study outcome or
             interpretation of study results will be excluded

          -  Subjects on significant concomitant drug therapy for systemic conditions (i.e.
             cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction) will not be included in the study.
             Occasional short term use (7-14 days) of analgesics or common cold medication is
             permitted. Such use of these medications will be reviewed and recorded by the
             Investigator.
