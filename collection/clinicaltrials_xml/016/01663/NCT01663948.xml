  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the international plastic bronchitis registry is to understand the natural
      course and long term health outcomes of subjects diagnosed with plastic bronchitis due to
      different types of casts. This provides essential data for identifying best practices and
      treatments. The secondary aim is to understand the structure of casts and mechanism of their
      formation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plastic bronchitis (PB) patients have casts removed during bronchoscopy as part of their
      routine care or that they are able to expectorate (cough out) casts naturally. The casts are
      normally discarded. Patients that agree to participate in the registry ship the airway casts
      and medical history to Dr. Bruce Rubin's Research Laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth
      University Richmond Virginia, USA.

      The lab evaluates the biopolymer composition and structure of the airway casts by
      immunohistochemistry in order to identify microscopic differences between expectorated casts
      of subjects with plastic bronchitis and sputum from other populations (cystic
      fibrosis,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and normal airways). The lab also conducts
      in vitro evaluation of clearability, adhesivity, cohesivity, and inflammatory mediator
      concentrations to better understand the nature of the disease.
