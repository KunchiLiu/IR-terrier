  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain affects 80% of Americans at some time during their lives. Although recovery
      usually occurs within 6 months, there is a 50% recurrence within one year's time. It has
      long been thought that poor control of trunk muscle may lead to abnormal forces across the
      spine, which then damage local spinal structures, thus, leading to low back pain. However,
      the investigators know little about the function of specific trunk muscles in healthy
      subjects during various activities of daily life. Furthermore, the precise muscle
      dysfunction associated with low back pain has not been well characterized at all. In
      addition, the investigators know little about which exercise protocol is most beneficial for
      particular subgroups of people with low back pain. Thus, the purposes of this study are to
      learn more about: 1) how trunk muscles are affected by low back pain; 2) which exercises
      might be most beneficial for people with certain kinds of low back pain; and 3) how these
      exercises influence trunk muscle function. By having a better understanding of which trunk
      muscles are affected by low back pain, rehabilitation specialists can design exercise
      programs and therapeutic interventions that are more specific and more effective.

    <intervention_name>Stabilization exercise protocol</intervention_name>
    <description>The stabilization exercise protocol consists of exercises focused on improving the ability of trunk muscles to stabilize the spine, beginning with training to isolate the deeper abdominal muscles as well as deep dorsal trunk muscles. Then patients were progressed to exercises that added leverage of the limbs while maintaining the co-contraction of the deeper abdominal muscles and deep dorsal trunk muscles while breathing normally. Various positions (e.g., supine and quadruped positions) were used to challenge the patients based on their tolerance. Finally, patients were progressed to exercises in more functional positions that included tasks/activities that were reported as challenging and/or painful; patients performed the tasks at the speed demanded by the particular task. Maintenance of the co-contraction of deep trunk muscles was emphasized during these functional activities.</description>

    <intervention_name>Strength and conditioning exercise protocol</intervention_name>
    <description>This protocol contained trunk strengthening and endurance exercises. It consisted of 3 phases: 1) initial strengthening of trunk flexors/extensors in single plane movements, 2) trunk and lower-extremity stretching as well as progression of trunk-strengthening exercises to include multi-planar trunk movements. Aerobic exercises were progressed as tolerated and patient education about body biomechanics were reinforced, and 3) trunk-strengthening exercises under dynamic conditions (e.g., unstable support surface and in multi-planar trunk movements). During the 10 week protocol, exercises became more challenging, and each subject had to complete at least the first phase before moving onto the next phase in order to be included in post-testing analyses. There was no specific focus on the deep abdominal or deep dorsal trunk muscles during any of these exercises.</description>
