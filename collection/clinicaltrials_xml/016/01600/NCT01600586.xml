    <textblock>
      NICU infants are at high risk for oromotor difficulties including poor coordination of
      sucking swallowing and breathing. These feeding difficulties often result in prolonged
      hospitalization, with increased physiologic stressors and poor growth. In preliminary
      studies, Pacifier Activated Lullaby (PAL) use showed potential increased oromotor skills and
      decreased length of hospitalization.

      The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that a week-long PAL intervention can
      improve feeding skills and decrease stress compared to standard of care parental
      interactions in infants in the late preterm period. The investigators also hypothesize that
      these improvements will result in shorter hospital stays and increased growth in the
      intervention group.

      Our study design is a prospective randomized controlled trial design of 94 NICU infants
      (Post-conceptional ages 34-36 weeks) in the Vanderbilt NICU. The 47 intervention-group
      infant/mother dads will receive a book library with one lullaby book and record her voice to
      the PAL, which the music therapist will then administer in 15-minute sessions for 5
      consecutive days. The 47 participants in the control group will receive the same library but
      no recording will be made or PAL used. Outcomes measured will include time to full oral
      feeds, suck rate and efficiency, salivary cortisol levels before and after intervention,
      daily growth parameters and nutritional data, and hospital length of stay.

      Objectives: We conducted a randomized trial to test the hypothesis that the mother's voice
      played through a pacifier-activated music (PAM) player during nonnutritive sucking would
      improve the development of sucking ability and promote more effective oral feeding in
      preterm infants.

      Methods: Preterm infants between 34 0/7 and 35 6/7 weeks postmenstrual age, including those
      with brain injury, who were taking at least half their feedings enterally and less than half
      orally, were randomly assigned to receive 5 daily 15-minute sessions of either PAM with
      mother's recorded voice or no PAM, along with routine nonnutritive sucking and maternal care
      in both groups. Assignment was masked to the clinical team.

      Results: Ninety-four infants, (46 and 48 in the PAM intervention and control groups,
      respectively) completed the study. The intervention group had significantly increased oral
      feeding rate (2.0 vs. 0.9 ml/min, p &lt; 0.001), oral volume intake (91.1 vs. 48.1 ml/kg/d, p =
      0.001), oral feeds/day (6.5 vs. 4 p &lt; 0.001), and faster-time-to-full oral feedings (31 vs.
      38 d, p = 0.04 compared to controls. Weight gain and cortisol levels during the 5-day
      protocol were not different between groups. Average hospital stays were 20% shorter in the
      PAM group, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.07).

      Conclusion: A PAM using mother's voice improves oral feeding skills in preterm infants
      without adverse effects on hormonal stress or growth.
