  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-year (except for participants with chronic kidney disease [CKD] or
      cirrhosis) multicenter study to follow participants who received at least one dose of
      grazoprevir (MK-5172) in a previous study to determine whether they remain hepatitis C virus
      (HCV)-RNA negative over time, and to determine if they have developed antiviral resistance.
      The study will also evaluate long-term adverse events in this population. Participants from
      MK-5172-052 (NCT02092350) with CKD or cirrhosis will be followed for five years.

      As of Amendment 03, the study design is revised such that continued enrollment will only be
      for participants who failed prior therapy with a grazoprevir regimen. Participants with CKD
      enrolled from MK-5172-052 (NCT02092350) will continue enrollment regardless of prior
      treatment-response and remain in this study for five years, while participants enrolled from
      all other studies with HCV RNA less than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be
      discontinued and end their participation after the next scheduled visit. In addition,
      participants who receive other HCV treatments concurrent with this follow-up study or
      received other HCV treatments prior to this study will be discontinued and their data
      excluded from analysis.

        Participants previously treated with a grazoprevir-containing regimen while enrolled in a
        Merck study. All participants enrolled having failed therapy from prior studies (except
        MK-5172-052 [NCT02092350]) will be followed for 3 years in the current follow-up study,
        and all participants enrolled from MK-5172-052 (irrespective of prior response) will be
        followed for 5 years in the current follow-up study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously participated in a HCV treatment protocol that included grazoprevir in the
             treatment regimen.

          -  Must enroll in the present study within three months of the last study visit of their
             previous protocol in which they received a grazoprevir-containing regimen.

          -  For Amendment 03: Participants must have received a grazoprevir-containing regimen in
             a prior trial and have been identified as having failed therapy in that study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received HCV therapy after completion of the protocol-defined grazoprevir
             treatment trial regimen and before or after entry into this follow-up study

          -  For Amendment 03: Has failed therapy due to re-infection.

          -  For Amendment 03: Has failed therapy and received retreatment with HCV therapy,
             except in the case where they were re-treated in a Merck-sponsored protocol.
