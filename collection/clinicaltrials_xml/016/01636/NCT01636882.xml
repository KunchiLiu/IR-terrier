    <textblock>
      This is an extended use study for patients who have received 10 doses of CAVATAK™ in the VLA
      007 trial. There may be patients who have benefitted from the study drug and who might
      benefit from further treatment. In order to accommodate those patients further treatment to
      complete 48 weeks of CVA21 intratumoral injections will be made available.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients must have reached Week 24 of the core protocol in immune-related complete
             response (irCR), immune-related partial response (irPR), immune-related stable
             disease (irSD), or immune-related progressive disease (irPD) (unconfirmed) with
             evidence of tumor inflammatory reaction.

          -  2. If patient is in irPD (unconfirmed) status, they must not have had a decrease in
             their Karnofsky Performances Scale (KPS) score &gt; 10 points and to be judged to not
             have &quot;rapid clinical deterioration&quot; by the investigator since the subject's last
             tumor measurement leading to irPD assessment.

          -  3. Patients must start treatment in the extension protocol within 8 weeks of their
             last injection administered in the core protocol.

          -  4. Patient is able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in
             the study.

          -  5. Fertile males and females must agree to the use of an adequate form of
             contraception, e.g., condoms for males.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Tumors to be injected lying in mucosal regions or close to an airway, major blood
             vessel or spinal cord that, in the opinion of the Investigators, could cause
             occlusion or compression in the case of tumor swelling or erosion into a major vessel
             in the case of necrosis.

          -  2. If lesions are too small to be visualized or palpable for accurate injection.

          -  3. Currently in status of irPD (confirmed) or irPD (unconfirmed) without evidence of
             tumor inflammatory response, or with rapid clinical deterioration, or with a decrease
             of 10 points or more on their KPS score since their last assessment before irPD
             (unconfirmed) assessment.
