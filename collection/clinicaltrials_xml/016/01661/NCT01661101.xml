    <textblock>
      Patients who have myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery are at a higher risk of dying
      than those who do not. One in 10 patients with myocardial injury will die within 30 days of
      surgery. This risk of death exists up to one year after myocardial injury. There are
      currently no treatments or guidelines available for heart injury after surgery, but there is
      evidence that taking a blood-thinner can prevent some of the deaths, both in the short and
      long-term. The purpose of this trial is to test the effect of two drugs (dabigatran and
      omeprazole) that may prevent mortality, major cardiovascular complications and major upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who have had myocardial injury after noncardiac
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial injury is the most common major vascular complication after noncardiac surgery.
      Worldwide approximately 10 million adults annually suffer a perioperative myocardial injury.
      This figure for perioperative myocardial injury represents 15-20% of all cases of myocardial
      infarction in all settings. Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery carries a poor
      prognosis and is an independent predictor of 30-day and 1-year mortality.

      Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) differs from non-operative myocardial
      infarction in two ways; it has a poorer prognosis (patients suffering MINS are 2 times more
      likely to die within 30 days compared to non-operative myocardial infarction in the
      emergency room) and paradoxically its treatment is less intensive. This difference in the
      intensity of treatment is likely influenced by several factors including: (1) a majority of
      patients suffering MINS do not experience ischemic symptoms, potentially influencing
      physicians' perception of the severity of the event; (2) there is debate as to the
      pathophysiology of MINS (although emerging evidence does suggest that coronary arterial
      thrombosis is an important mechanism of MINS); and (3) no randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      has evaluated an intervention to manage MINS, and hence physicians are uncertain about the
      risk-benefit ratio of potential interventions (e.g., interventions that are effective in the
      management of non-operative myocardial infarction). From a human and economic perspective,
      it is a tragedy that some patients undergoing noncardiac surgery for important reasons
      (e.g., to obtain a cure of their cancer or to become mobile after a new prosthetic joint)
      fail to obtain these benefits, because they suffer MINS that ultimately takes their life.
      There is an urgent need for clinical trials to identify effective therapies to improve the
      outcomes of patients suffering MINS.

      There exists promising laboratory, autopsy, imaging, operative, and non-operative data
      suggesting that patients suffering MINS will benefit from anticoagulant therapy. Dabigatran
      (a direct thrombin inhibitor) warrants evaluation in the management of MINS. The major
      limitation of anticoagulation therapy is bleeding, and gastrointestinal bleeding represents
      a substantial proportion of these complications. Gastrointestinal bleeding is important in
      its own right, but also because it leads to cessation of anticoagulant therapy which may
      lead to breakthrough myocardial infarction. Omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) is
      efficacious in preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with coronary artery
      disease who are taking dual antiplatelet therapy, and may benefit patients receiving
      anticoagulation therapy after suffering MINS.

      We will undertake a large international RCT to determine the impact of dabigatran in
      patients who have suffered MINS. We will use a partial factorial design (for patients not
      taking a proton pump inhibitor) to determine the impact of omeprazole in this setting. We
      call this RCT the Management of myocardial injury After NoncArdiac surGEry (MANAGE) Trial.
