  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of immunosuppression
      withdrawal (ISW) in pediatric liver transplant (tx) recipients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-rejection medicines, also known as immunosuppressive drugs, are prescribed to organ
      transplant recipients to prevent rejection of the new organ. Long-term use of these
      medicines places transplant recipients at higher risk of serious infections and certain
      types of cancer.

      This study seeks to:

        -  Find out if it is safe to slowly reduce and then completely stop the immunosuppression
           taken by children who have received liver transplants. This process is called
           'immunosuppression withdrawal'or ISW.

        -  Find blood or liver biopsy tests that can help transplant doctors in the future to
           predict if it is safe to decrease or stop immunosuppression drugs in children who have
           had a liver transplant.
