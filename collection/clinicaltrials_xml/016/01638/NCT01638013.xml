    <textblock>
      This study is an extension study conducted as an open-label multicenter study in rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) patients who completed the Phase IIb Study of ASP015K [015K-CL-RAJ1
      (hereinafter referred to as study RAJ1)], Phase III Study of ASP015K [015K-CL-RAJ3 (RAJ3)],
      or Phase III Study of ASP015K [015K-CL-RAJ4 (RAJ4)].

      Patients will receive oral ASP015K once daily (QD) after breakfast. The ASP015K dose can be
      increased later if the subjects have no safety problems but show lack of efficacy.

      The duration of treatment with the study drug will differ depending upon the subject.
