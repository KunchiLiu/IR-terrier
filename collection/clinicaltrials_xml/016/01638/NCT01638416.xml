  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Australia, blood for transfusion has a &quot;use by&quot; date of 42 days after collection. The
      actual age of blood given to patients depends on what is available at the time and the rate
      of usage. During the last decade, it has been reported that blood transfusion in patients
      admitted to intensive care was associated with an independent increase of mortality. Some
      research suggests that transfusion of fresher blood might help patients in the intensive
      care unit to reach a better recovery. This project will test whether patients who receive
      'fresher' blood do better than patients who receive 'standard issue' blood.

      Inclusion criteria

      â€¢Patients hospitalised in ICU with an anticipated ICU stay of at least 24 hours, in whom the
