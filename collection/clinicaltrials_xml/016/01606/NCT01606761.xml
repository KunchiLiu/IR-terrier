  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of sirukumab as measured by the
      reduction of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with active RA
      who are unresponsive or intolerant to treatment with anti-TNF-alpha agents.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment groups, and they and study personnel will
      not know the identity of the treatments given. Some patients will receive a placebo, which
      resembles a medication, but does not contain an active substance. This helps to determine if
      the study agent is effective. Patients will receive placebo or sirukumab by injection under
      the skin. The expected duration of the study is 68 weeks, which includes 52 weeks of
      treatment. Participants who complete participation in the study will be eligible for
      inclusion into the long term extension study if enrollment at a participating site is
      available to them. If they do not participate in the long-term study, they will continue
      into the safety follow-up for approximately 16 weeks. The placebo-controlled portion of the
      study is through Week 24, when placebo patients will cross over to one of two sirukumab dose
      regimens. Patient safety will be monitored throughout the study.
