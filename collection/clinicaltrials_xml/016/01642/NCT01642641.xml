    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the most efficient treatment approach (two
      surgical and one non-surgical) in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic periodontitis,
      with regard to healing and resolution of disease, patient reported outcomes and cost
      effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal diseases (PD) are highly prevalent chronic diseases, and may be associated with
      loss of gum and bone tissue surrounding the tooth. Among adults (with 2 or more teeth
      remaining) in England, 54% experienced gum bleeding and 45% had periodontal (gum) disease of
      which 9% was severe. Bacterial in origin, the high prevalence of PD, together with increased
      retention of teeth at older ages, has considerable implications for the population's future
      treatment needs and the associated costs to the health system. It is therefore important to
      ensure interventions delivered are those proven to be most efficient and cost effective. The
      investigators study question will therefore be, &quot;In an adult population with moderate to
      severe chronic periodontitis, how will 3 different treatment approaches; simplified papilla
      preservation flap (SPPF), resective periodontal flap with osseous recontouring (RPFO) and
      subgingival debridement (SD), differ in regard to healing and resolution of disease, patient
      reported outcomes and cost effectiveness?&quot; The aim of this study is to find the most
      efficient way to treat chronic periodontitis, through a randomised controlled trial of 3
      established forms of treatment.

      Research will be carried out at the Eastman Dental Institute and Hospital, specifically in
      the Eastman Clinical Investigation Centre (ECIC), a dedicated clinical research centre. A
      total of 87 participants will be recruited in order to provide the necessary power to
      discriminate between the 3 treatment approaches. Eligible patients, who fit the inclusion
      criteria, will be drawn from hospital referrals and once informed consent is gained, will be
      randomised to one of the 3 approaches. Two surgical approaches (SPPF, RPFO) will be compared
      with a non-surgical (SD) approach, and followed up over a 12 month period. Among other
      things, the investigators will compare clinical parameters of wound healing (including
      bacterial changes), patient's quality of life and cost-effectiveness.
