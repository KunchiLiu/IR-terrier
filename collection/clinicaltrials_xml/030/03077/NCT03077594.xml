  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively assess the functional aspects of the the esophageal squamous epithelial
      barrier and correlate this with tissue inflammation and intercellular space dilation in
      patients who have successfully completed endoscopic therapy for Barrett's Esophagus related
      metaplasia.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will measure and correlate mucosal impedance (measured using a novel
      endoscopic mucosal impedance catheter), intercellular space as measured with transmission
      electron microscopy and tissue levels of prostaglandin E2 in patients undergoing
      surveillance following successful endoscopic therapy (defined as two negative endoscopic
      surveillance histology for intestinal metaplasia).

      Mucosal impedance will be measured by an endoscopic probe 1 cm above the gastroesophageal
      junction, 5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction and in the proximal esophagus in an area
      not exposed to the index therapeutic radiofrequency ablation. Research biopsies will also be
      obtained at these levels for measurement of tissue levels of prostaglandin E2 and
      intracellular space with transmission electron microscopy.
