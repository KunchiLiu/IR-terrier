  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, the prevalence of chronic disease is increasing and patients presenting with
      multiple conditions (i.e., multimorbidity) are becoming the norm in primary care. Complex
      treatment regimens such as administration of medications (including insulin), clinical
      monitoring and screening for complications, adherence to dietary and lifestyle changes, and
      decisions about when to seek medical care are challenging. To help people with complex
      health conditions optimize their care and outcomes, community health worker programs have
      begun to be used across the United States and Canada. Existing community health worker
      programs share a common goal of helping patients to overcome modifiable barriers to care to
      achieve optimal outcomes.

      While community health workers may work within a primary health care team, the primary role
      of the community health worker is not clinically oriented, and may be fulfilled by
      laypersons. Depending on the targeted barriers, specific tasks may include one or more of:
      disease education, health system education, assistance with insurance coverage, aid in care
      coordination, and referral to community resources, among others. Herein, the investigators
      aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a community health worker intervention on improving
      acute care utilization among patients with complex chronic disease seen in primary care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic diseases are long--term conditions that progress in severity over time and are
      generally not curable. Results from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) indicate
      that approximately 21% of adults over 20 years had at least one major chronic disease. Among
      these, approximately 10% had diabetes, 6% had cardiovascular disease, 4% had heart failure,
      and 10% had asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, reported by the Canadian
      Chronic Disease Surveillance System. In 2012-13, over 735,000 Albertans had at least one
      major chronic disease, and publicly funded health services for these patients cost the
      Alberta government approximately $4.5 billion dollars in that year.

      In Canada, the prevalence of chronic disease is increasing and patients presenting with
      multiple conditions (i.e., multimorbidity) are becoming the norm in primary care.
      Multimorbidity is associated with poor quality of life, decline in functional status, and a
      high burden on the healthcare system. Safe, efficacious and cost--effective interventions
      for chronic diseases are available, however these treatments are under-utilized. Individuals
      with chronic diseases may have difficulty achieving care goals due to a combination of
      patient, provider and system level barriers. Complex treatment regimens such as
      administration of medications (including insulin), clinical monitoring and screening for
      complications, adherence to dietary and lifestyle changes, and decisions about when to seek
      medical care are challenging. The ability to comply with these recommendations is dependent
      on a number of factors, including health and financial status, access to care and care
      experience, and personal circumstance.

      To help people with complex health conditions optimize their care and outcomes, community
      health worker programs have begun to be used across the United States and Canada. Existing
      community health worker programs share a common goal of helping patients to overcome
      modifiable barriers to care to achieve optimal outcomes, and are a possible solution to
      overcoming barriers to accessing health care in patients with complex chronic disease.

      While community health workers may work within a primary health care team, the primary role
      of the community health worker is not clinically oriented, and may be fulfilled by
      laypersons. Depending on the targeted barriers, specific tasks may include one or more of:
      disease education, health system education, assistance with insurance coverage, aid in care
      coordination, and referral to community resources, among others. Herein, the investigators
      propose a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a community health worker intervention on
      improving acute care utilization among patients with complex chronic disease seen in primary
      care.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will test the effectiveness of the intervention using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in 12 primary care clinics with a target population size of 1200 patients. In order to balance pragmatism with scientific rigour, the investigators will randomize clinics to phased implementation (4 clinics per year), ensuring that all participating clinics will receive the intervention. Clinics on the waitlist will serve as controls. Intervention status will not be concealed; patients in the control group will be identified from medical records and will undergo baseline and follow--up assessment and will be told that they will be eligible for the intervention at a later time.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients will be matched to a CHW from their primary care practice. The CHW will conduct a needs assessment to determine the intensity of intervention and frequency of meetings needed. A CHW may perform any of the following: providing information directly to a patient's health care provider, translating to the patient's language, advocating for the patient, connecting the patient with resources (i.e., social, financial, insurance), helping patients set health--related goals, liaising with a patient's employer to make sure the patient's health needs are met, facilitating health care referrals and appointments, monitoring appointments, and facilitating transportation to appointments. These activities may require the CHW to be physically present at the patient's appointments or have direct contact with the patient's health care provider. Goal setting and social support will be provided in- person or over the telephone using motivational interviewing (MI) principles.</description>
