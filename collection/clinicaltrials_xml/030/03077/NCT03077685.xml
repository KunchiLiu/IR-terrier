      Open-label, dose-escalating, Phase IIa trial of NanoPac to treat subjects with locally

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label, dose-escalating, Phase IIa trial, subjects with locally advanced
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma located in the tail or body of the pancreas will receive
      intratumoral (ITU) NanoPac (Sterile Nanoparticulate Paclitaxel) via endoscopic
      ultrasound-guided direct injection.

      Subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts of NanoPac at escalating doses, at a volume
      based on up to 20% of calculated tumor volume (with a maximum injection volume of 5 mL per
      subject). Each cohort will have three subjects, with cohorts enrolled sequentially starting
      at the lowest concentration. Following DSMB review of the cohort data, the next cohort may
      begin enrolling, an additional three subjects at the current dose may be enrolled, or if the
      first dose does not provide adequate safety and tolerability the study may be halted.

      The dose determined to be most suitable for further evaluation, defined as the highest dose
      with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile as determined by the Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB), will enroll additional subjects to provide a cohort of up to 12
      subjects at that dose level.

      Plasma samples will be taken at various time points on the day of NanoPac injection as well
      as once at each of the study visits, to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      intratumoral NanoPac.

      Subjects will be followed for three months after NanoPac injection for safety, overall
      survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), CA-19-9 levels, carcinoembryonic antigen
      (CEA) levels, reduction in pain, and tumor response to therapy (as shown by imaging). A
      follow-up visit may be conducted at six months, as applicable.

Subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts of a fixed concentration of NanoPac at a volume correlating up to 20% of calculated tumor volume (with a maximum injection volume of 5 mL per subject). Each cohort will have three subjects, with cohorts enrolled sequentially starting at the lowest concentration. Following DSMB review of the cohort data, the next cohort may begin enrolling, an additional three subjects at the current dose may be enrolled, or if the first dose does not provide adequate safety and tolerability the study may be halted.
