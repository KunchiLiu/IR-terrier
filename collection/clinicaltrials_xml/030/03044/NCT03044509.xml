      1. The primary objective is to improve the sensitivity of novel immunodiagnostic tests for
           detection of TB disease in children.

        2. The secondary objective is to determine biomarkers that discriminate children with TB
           infection and disease.

  <detailed_description>

      1. This will be done by measuring a variety of parameters in the blood samples and compare
           them with the current diagnostic gold standard for TB or for culture/NAAT non-confirmed
           TB cases a consensus case definition is used.

           Currently available immunodiagnostic tests (IGRA/TST) will be compared to novel
           immunodiagnostic tests which will include:

             -  several novel, additional M. tuberculosis-specific Antigens

             -  cytokines that are highly expressed

        2. Since there is no diagnostic gold standard for TB infection we will rely on a clinical
           composite reference standard for diagnosing TB infection. Biomarkers will be determined
           by:

             -  including M. tuberculosis-specific antigens that are specifically expressed in
                either TB infection or disease,

             -  measuring phenotypes and cytokine production of M. tuberculosis-specific cells.

    <description>Based on current evidence it is estimated that the sensitivity of the immunodiagnostic tests with regard to the identification of patients with TB infection or disease versus no TB is approximately 80 %. By applying a sample size approximation a minimum sample size of 126 patients with TB infection or disease (with a precision given by a 95 % confidence interval with a width of 20 %) will be needed to statistically show a significant result.</description>

    <measure>Indicative markers identification for TB infection and disease distinction</measure>
    <time_frame>27 months</time_frame>
    <description>A minimum sample size of 84 patients with TB infection is needed (with a precision given by a 95 % confidence interval with a width of 30 %). Among patients with TB infection or TB disease, a novel test is used to discriminate between these patient groups. It is estimated that the sensitivity of this test with regard to the identification of patients with TB infection (secondary outcome) is approximately 60 %.</description>

    <description>Blood collected in a sodium-heparin tube will be used for the assay using novel TB-specific antigens. After incubation the supernatant will be harvested and cryopreserved at -80 °C for further testing of cytokines. Cytokines will be measured using a bead-based multiplex assay reader (MAGPIX, Luminex Crop., Austin, USA).</description>

        It will be a national multicentre study in Switzerland. Children will be recruited within
        SwissPedNet, the Swiss Research Network of Clinical Paediatric Hubs, which includes five
        University Children's Hospitals (Basel, Bern, Geneva, Lausanne and Zürich) and four
        cantonal A-clinics (Aarau, Bellinzona, Luzern and St. Gallen). Currently approximately
        20-30 children with TB disease are notified in Switzerland each year. For TB infection in
        children there are no data available in Switzerland. However, data from the &quot;Lungenliga
        Schweiz&quot; show that in 2014, at least 232 children were examined for a TB contact
        investigation (correspondence with Jean-Pierre Zellweger and Jean-Marie Egger, Lungenliga
        Schweiz 13.08.2015). Of these 13 % (i.e. around 30 children) are categorized as TB
        infection per year.
