          -  Have had an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan
             concurrent with or following the diagnosis of probable AD, to exclude prior stroke or

             diagnosis of psychosis prior to the development of AD)

          -  Have significant cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic,

          -  Are currently enrolled in any other clinical trial involving an investigational
