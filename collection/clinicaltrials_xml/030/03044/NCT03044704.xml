  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective-observational, explorative single-centre cohort study aimed to
      examine the influence of hemodynamic and geometric parameters on the progression of
      atherosclerotic alterations in peripheral vessels (carotids, femoral artery).
      Atherosclerotic alterations (IMT, plaque volume) will be measured with a ultrasound (IMT
      measurements and 3D quantitative plaque volumetry) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      Geometric parameters (e.g. carotid/femoral bifurcation angle, carotid/femoral bifurcation
      area) are assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and also 3D ultrasonography.

      A total of 100 patients with an asymmetrical plaque distribution in carotid and femoral
      arteries will be tested. Only patients who are already enrolled in the &quot;Correlation of
      Artherosclerotic Plaque Volume and Intima Media Thickness With Soluble P-selectin&quot;
      (NCT01895725) and who are tested prior for an asymmetrical plaque distribution will be
      included in this study. MRI will be performed once whereas ultrasound imaging will be be
      repeated once per year (up to five times) to assess changes in these parameters over time.
      Also plasma samples will be collected once yearly and tested for traditional and novel
      cardiovascular risk factors.

      The primary endpoint of the planned study will be the correlation between geometrical and
      hemodynamic parameters as stated above and the progression of atherosclerosis as measured by
      plaque volume and IMT in the carotid and femoral arteries, respectively.

      Secondary endpoints will include the correlation of geometrical and hemodynamic parameters
      with established (hypertension, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia) and novel risk factors
      (hsCRP, P-selectin, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), intercellular adhesion
      molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CETP TaqIb polymorphism), with cardiovascular event rate, plaque
      localization, plaque morphology and the additional predictive value of geometrical
      parameters compared to an established risk score (SCORE card).

    <description>Haemodynamic/geometric parameters will be assessed with MRI and 3D-US. This includes carotid/femoral bifurcation angle, common carotid/femoral area, carotid/femoral bifurcation area, internal and external carotid area, femoral superficial artery area and carotid/femoral bifurcation length.
