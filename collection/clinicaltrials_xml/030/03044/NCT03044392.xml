  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of practice for the maintenance of epidural analgesia is through use of
      a continuous infusion pump. Enhanced technology now supports the use of programmed
      intermittent bolus (PIEB) administration. This novel drug delivery system provides small
      boluses of local anesthetic and opioid at programmed intervals. Several studies suggest that
      administration of PIEB allows a more extensive spread of local anesthetic in the epidural
      space and provides superior labour analgesia compared to traditional continuous epidural
      infusions. PIEB is associated with lower anesthetic consumption, a shorter second stage of
      labour and greater patient satisfaction.

      The authors are focusing on a PIEB setting known as the &quot;Next Bolus&quot;. &quot;Next Bolus&quot; (NB)
      determines when the first PIEB bolus is given after the initiation of the epidural and
      starting the PIEB pump. Currently we set this to be 15-45 minutes. In an attempt to optimize
      resources, authors hope to determine the optimal NB interval that will provide adequate
      analgesia but limit overall drug consumption. An optimally timed next bolus should minimize
      drug costs and limit nurse and physician intervention by decreasing the need for manual
      boluses.Increased local anesthetic consumption can cause undesirable side effects such as
      itchiness, decreased blood pressure and motor blockade. By assigning patients to receive the
      NB at 15, 30 or 45 minutes the authors hope to find the interval that provides analgesia
      while minimizing side effects, improving patient safety. If the bolus is given too late then
      there may be increased pain, less patient satisfaction, and the need for more analgesia in
      the form of Patient Controlled Epidural Anesthesia or a manual bolus.The authors hope that
      determining the NB will result in an institutional change to improve patient outcomes and
      facilitate knowledge transfer. This information will be the first available research to help
      guide other obstetrical centres using PIEB technology in determining the optimal NB
      interval.
