  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this non-randomized, multi-center study in subjects with severe hereditary
      haemophilia B was to determine and compare the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of
      BeneFIX in subjects having had 2 prior pharmacokinetic assessments with AlphaNine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two pharmacokinetic assessments (studies) were carried out in the same subjects during a
      previous clinical trial. The first pharmacokinetic study (PK1) was performed after a single
      dose of AlphaNine. The second pharmacokinetic study (PK2) was performed following 26 Weeks
      of AlphaNine treatment after PK1. To compare AlphaNine with BeneFIX, a third pharmacokinetic
      study (PK3) (current study) was performed after a single dose of BeneFIX administered
      following a 7- to 15-day wash-out period.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participated in the previous study &quot;Efficacy and safety of factor IX (FIX) contained
             in Alphananine in patients with severe hereditary haemophilia B&quot;:

          -  Congenital deficiency in Factor IX (FIX)

          -  FIX residual activity of ≤2% of normal

          -  Had required FIX-containing products in the past and in clinical records that were
             collected data to assess a reliable estimation of at least 150 treatment exposure
             days to previous products

          -  Was able to receive treatment for more than 10 days for a 6-month period

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received a dose of FIX in the 7 days prior to the infusion

          -  FIX inhibitor level of &gt;0.5 Bethesda units (BU) or clinically relevant presence in
             the past (≥5 BU)

          -  Active bleeding at the moment of infusion

          -  Had a known allergic reaction to any BeneFIX component

          -  Exhibited symptoms of any intercurrent infection (ie, fever, chills, nausea) at the
             time of the first infusion

          -  Had any disease that might affect the distribution or metabolism of FIX and which
             could affect interpretation of the study (such as non-controlled diabetes mellitus)

          -  Had non-controlled arterial hypertension

          -  Had abnormal renal function (creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL)

          -  Had documented liver cirrhosis or any hepatic disorder with alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) levels 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN )

          -  Prevision to be concomitantly treated with other FIX-containing products

          -  Had conditions that might affect subject compliance (survival-limiting [in 2 year
             time] diseases, alcohol or other drug abuse, etc.)

          -  Unable to provide a storage plasma sample before the first dose of BeneFIX
