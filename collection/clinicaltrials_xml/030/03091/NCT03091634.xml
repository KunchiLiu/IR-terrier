    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controled trial. the purpose of
      this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Xu-Fu-Zhu-Yu Capsule in Treatment
      of Qi Stagnation and Blood Stasis syndrome(QS&amp;BSS).QS&amp;BSS is a group of symptoms and signs
      of human, such as pain in a fixed position, lumps in body, irritability or depression, dim
      complexion, unsmooth or string-like pulse, purplish tongue or petechia in the tongue. it's a
      maladjustment of our body that almost everyone would fall into this condition several times
      in the long period of our life. it has some potential connections with several kinds of
      disease, such as cardiovascular,endometriosis, fracture. Xu-Fu-Zhu-Yu capsule is a patent
      drug which has been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. It derives from an
      ancient Chinese traditional medicine formula, which has been used to treat QS&amp;BSS for almost
      200 years. Experimental studies have shown that Xu-Fu-Zhu-Yu capsule can treat many kinds of
      disease, such as coronary heart disease, insomnia, headache. And, all these patients have
      QS&amp;BSS. So, our research group plan this randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of the Xu-Fu-Zhu-Yu Capsule in Treatment of QS&amp;BSS. a total of 120
      paticipants will be randomly allocated into either the test group or control group in a 1:1
      ratio at 3 sites. All paticipants, with different kinds of disease, will be given the
      standard medical care according to the guidelines. Participants will undergo a 7-week
      treatment. the primary outcome is the efficacy of QS&amp;BSS and the improvement of single
      symptom. the secondary outcome is the change in the total score of the patient reported
      outcomes of QS&amp;BSS(PRO index). Safety outcomes include physical examination (temperature,
      respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, height and weight), complete blood cell count,
      urinalysis, stool examination, fecal occult blood test, liver function (alanine
      aminotransferase(ALT),aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), serum total
      bilirubin (STB), and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT)), renal function (serum creatinine
      (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum cystatin C, and urine N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase)
      and electrocardiogram (ECG) at the first,and seventh weeks.
