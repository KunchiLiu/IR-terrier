      TENSION (Efficacy and safety of ThrombEctomy iN Stroke with extended leSION and extended
      time window) is a prospective, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE), European two-arm,
      randomized, controlled, post-market study to compare the safety and effectiveness of
      endovascular thrombectomy as compared to best medical care alone in the treatment of acute
      ischemic stroke patients with extended stroke lesions defined by an Alberta Stroke Program
      Early CT Score (ASPECTS) score of 3-5 and in an extended time window (up to 12 hours or
      unknown time of symptom onset). Up to 714 subjects will be randomized. Primary endpoint will
      be functional outcome assessed by the modified Rankin scale at 90 days post-stroke (&quot;mRS
      shift analysis&quot;). By this, TENSION will provide evidence of efficacy and safety of
      thrombectomy in an acute stroke population with uncertain benefit of endovascular stroke
      treatment.

      This study is a prospective, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE),European, two-arm,
      randomized, controlled, post-market study to compare the safety and effectiveness of
      endovascular thrombectomy as compared to best medical care alone in the treatment of acute
      ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients with extended stroke lesions defined by an ASPECT score of
      3-5 and in an extended time window (up to 12 hours, or unknown time of symptom onset). This
      is an adaptive design study, with prospectively stated interim analyses with specified
      stopping rules allowing for the possibility early termination based on either a
      determination of study success or futility.

      Up to 714 subjects will be enrolled in the study and randomized for the Intention to treat
      analysis set. The randomization will be stratified by time from symptom onset (0-6h and
      6-11h/wake up stroke), and stroke severity (NIHSS ≤18, NIHSS &gt;18).

      Interim data analysis is planned after the primary endpoint has been obtained for one third
      and two thirds of the patients. At each of these sample sizes, the available 90-day mRS data
      for each treatment arm will be evaluated. Safety interim analysis will be performed after
      one third and two thirds of the patients have been included.

      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the
      following two treatment arms:

      Arm 1: best medical care Arm 2: endovascular thrombectomy and best medical care The primary
      objective of this study is to test efficacy and safety of thrombectomy in acute stroke
      patients with uncertain benefit of endovascular stroke treatment, i.e. extended ischemic
      lesion size with an ASPECT score of 3-5 or late (up to 12 hours) or unknown time window as
      compared to best medical care alone.

      Approximately 40 sites in Up to 20 sites in 8-10 European countries Patients presenting with
      acute ischemic stroke (AIS) based on focal occlusion in the M1 segment of the middle
      cerebral artery (MCA), and/or the intracranial segment of the distal internal carotid artery
      (ICA), determined by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) or Computed Tomographic
      Angiography (CTA), and who meet all eligibility criteria will be considered for study
      enrollment.
