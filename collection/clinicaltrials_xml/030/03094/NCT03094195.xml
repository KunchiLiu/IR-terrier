        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At the time of Screening, have documented diagnosis of PHN (ICD-10 code B02.29),
             defined as pain in the region of the rash persisting for more than 6 months after
             onset of herpes zoster rash.

          -  Be assessed as suffering from moderate to severe neuropathic pain across the
             Screening epoch (NRS ≥ 4).

          -  Patients must have documented past and/or ongoing inadequate treatment response
             (having insufficient pain relief with treatment or inability to tolerate) to at least
             2 different prescribed therapies commonly used to treat and considered effective by
             the Investigator for the treatment of PHN.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or current diagnosis of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities indicating
             significant risk of safety for patients participating in the study

          -  Major depressive episode within 6 months prior to Screening and/or a history of
             diagnosed recurrent major depressive disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical
             Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-V) diagnostic criteria

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant.

          -  Have evidence of significant renal insufficiency or pre-existing liver condition

          -  Have platelets ≤ 100 x 10^9/L, or neutrophil count &lt; 1.2 x 10^9/L (or equivalent),
             hemoglobin ≤ 100 g/L for women or hemoglobin ≤ 110 g/L for men.

          -  Patients who have a known diagnosis of diabetes and are stable on medication with a
             hemoglobin A1c &gt; 8%. Those who do not have a known diagnosis of diabetes with a
             hemoglobin A1c &gt; 7%.

          -  Have previously received herpes zoster vaccine

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to complete daily e-Diary

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
