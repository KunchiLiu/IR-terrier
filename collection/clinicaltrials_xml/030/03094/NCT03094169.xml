  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 80 male and female patients with documented solid tumor malignancies of
      epithelial origin that are locally advanced or metastatic, and either refractory to standard
      therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available, will be entered into this Phase 1a/2a,
      multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, cohort study of AVID100, an anti-human EGFR
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) linked to the maytansinoid DM1.

      The initial Phase 1a Dose-Escalation portion of the trial (approximately 30 patients) is
      designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, as well as identify the DLT(s), MTD, and
      RP2D of sequential escalating doses of AVID100 (study drug), when administered to patients
      with tumors reasonably likely to express EGFR; secondary objectives include characterization
      of the PK profile of total antibody (AVID100 plus MAB100), AVID100, and DM1, as well as
      preliminary assessment of the antineoplastic activity of AVID100.

      Once the MTD and/or RP2D is identified, 3 expansion cohorts of patients (approximately 50
      patients total) with measureable disease and confirmed EGFR-positive tumors (tumor types to
      be determined) will be accrued during the subsequent Phase 2a Dose-Expansion portion of the
      trial where the goal will be to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      antineoplastic activity of AVID100 when administered at the RP2D; a secondary objective is
      to further characterize the PK profile of total antibody, AVID100, and DM1 (PK evaluation
      will be less extensive in Phase 2a when compared to Phase 1a).

      An exploratory objective in both the Phase 1a and Phase 2a portions of the trial will be
      evaluation of the utility of potential biomarkers and response predictors of AVID100
      activity in FFPE tumor tissue (optional in Phase 1a patients, required in Phase 2a
      patients). Patients will be treated and followed on an outpatient basis throughout the
      trial, unless hospitalization is required for other reasons, or to assure patient safety.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On Day 1 of study, patients will receive study drug administered by 1-hour IV infusion in a
      fixed 100 mL volume. AVID100 will be administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W) with
      administration on Day 1 of the first week, followed by a 3-week recovery period. This 3 week
      (21 day) period will be considered Cycle 1. In Phase 1a, determinations regarding cohort
      escalation, DLTs, and MTD will be based on the toxicities observed during this initial
      cycle. Patients must receive their full planned dose of AVID100, plus complete the
      designated follow-up period, in order to be considered evaluable for tolerability, unless
      dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation was the result of a DLT.

      In all patients entered, a minimum of at least Cycle 1 of study will be completed, if
      tolerated, after which, in the absence of documented disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity, a patient may continue to receive additional cycles of study drug Q3W (+ 2 days),
      at the same dose and infusion duration established for the patient during Cycle 1, and on
      the same schedule. These additional 3 week cycles may continue, if tolerated and in the
      absence of documented disease progression, at the Investigator's discretion, provided
      specified retreatment criteria have been met. Evidence of progressive disease at any point
      in the study will necessitate withdrawal of the patient from further participation so that
      alternative management of their malignancy may be considered.
