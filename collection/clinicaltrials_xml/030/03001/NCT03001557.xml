  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of
      lemborexant (4 dose levels) or placebo taken daily for 4 weeks in approximately 125 male or
      female participants, ages 65 to 90 years, with mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease dementia
      (AD-D) who complain of disrupted sleep or multiple awakenings at night along with frequent
      periods of falling asleep during the day that impact the quality of life of the participant.
      The study is designed to determine whether at least one dose of lemborexant is superior to
      placebo based on change from baseline in actigraphy Sleep Efficiency and actigraphy Wake
      Efficiency during the last week of 4 weeks of treatment in participants with Irregular
      Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder and AD-D.
