  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a unique membrane bound glycoprotein, which is
      overexpressed manifold on prostate cancer cells and is well-characterized as an imaging
      biomarker of prostate cancer. Positron emission tomography / computer tomography (PET/CT) is
      a nuclear medicine procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from radiolabeled
      tracer molecules. 18F-DCFPyL is a tracer for prostate cancer PET imaging which binds to
      PSMA. The strength of functional imaging methods is in distinguishing tissues according to
      metabolism rather than structure. Studies have shown that PET/CT imaging with 18F-DCFPyL can
      detect prostate cancer lesions with excellent contrast and a high detection rate even when
      the level of prostate specific antigen is low.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate if the patient-wide SUVmax on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT
      in locoregional and metastatic prostate cancer correlates with histopathologic Gleason score
      at initial biopsy. It is hypothesized that SUVmax will correlate positively with Gleason
      score. This is of interest because non-invasive risk stratification may be possible in the
      future.
