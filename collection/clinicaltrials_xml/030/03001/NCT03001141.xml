    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized registry/observational study. The study
      will enroll up to 200 patients with successful St. Jude Medical (SJM) Cardiac
      Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) MP device implant from up to 10 centers.

  <detailed_description>

      Any patient receiving a market-approved SJM Quadra Assura MP (CRT-D) or newer model
      quadripolar device with MPP capability and who meets the inclusion criteria and none of the
      exclusion criteria is eligible for enrollment in the study.

      Patients will be followed for 12 months after implant. Data will be collected after device
      implant (up to 30 days after successful implant), at 3, 6 and 12 months post-implant and
      during unscheduled visits.
