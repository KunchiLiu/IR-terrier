  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use participants tissue previously collected and stored in a tissue bank
      maintained by the Department of Hematology/Oncology as well as tissue banked in the future
      from participants undergoing prescribed surgical resection of vascular anomalies of interest
      proposed in this study. The principle investigator and study staff will also obtain blood
      from these participants.

    <textblock>
      While vascular anomalies are rare diseases, they can be life-threatening and devastating to
      affected children and their families. Advances in diagnosis, monitoring and therapies will
      be significantly improved if non-invasive biomarkers that are sensitive and specific can be
      identified. Identification of VEGF-D as a biomarker in LAM (Lymphangiomyomatosis) patients
      is an excellent example of how a blood biomarker can impact diagnosis and treatment.
      Biomarkers may also give insights into disease pathogenesis, as often they are released by
      cells that contribute to the disease process. The studies in this protocol will characterize
      and define biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with vascular
      anomalies. The differential diagnosis of some of these entities can be challenging,
      especially GLA versus KLA and KLA versus KHE. Obtaining a tissue biopsy to help in diagnosis
      can actually worsen the disease and so identification of specific blood biomarkers is highly
      desirable. Studies will measure angiogenic factors in serum and plasma samples at baseline
      and on therapy.

        Any participant having labs drawn as standard of care will have blood drawn for the study
        if consented/assented. All participants who are undergoing a surgical procedure or
        sclerotherapy are currently consented for participation in the tissue bank. The principle
        investigator will be looking at tissue from these participants. There is no further
        recruitment for the study.
