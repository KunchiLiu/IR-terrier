      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of serum phosphorus in
      hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of serum lipids (total
      cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) To document the efficacy of
      Renvela tablets in the reduction of calcium-phosphorus product.

      To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in the reduction of intact parathyroid hormone
      (iPTH).

      To document the efficacy of Renvela tablets in proportion of patients reaching the target
      serum phosphorus level (4.6 mg/dL [1.47 mmol/L], inclusive).

      To evaluate safety of Renvela tablets.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic kidney disease who have not been on dialysis, and are not
             expected to begin dialysis, or renal transplantation in the next 4 months from the
             screening visit.

          -  Have serum phosphorus measurement ≥5.5 mg/dL (1.78 mmol/L) at Screening Visit (if
