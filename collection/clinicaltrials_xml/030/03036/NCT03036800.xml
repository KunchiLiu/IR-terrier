    <textblock>
      A two year, parallel, two phase, two group, open-label, randomized controlled trial design
      for patients with severe and complex obesity who are referred to Tier 3 obesity service
      (including patients who are referred to Tier 3 service as part of the bariatric surgery
      pathway). This first phase of the study (first 52 weeks after randomization) will determine
      whether the targeted use of LIRA 3 mg in combination with the standard care provided in Tier
      3 setting will result in more participants attaining ≥15% weight loss compared to the
      standard care alone in a Tier 3 service. The second phase of the study will aim to provide
      some evidence whether the patients who will achieve ≥15% weight loss of baseline weight
      during the first phase of the study, will be able to maintain ≥15% weight loss for another
      52 weeks with the use of standard care plus LIRA 3mg compared to the standard care alone.
      Further, budget impact, cost-effectiveness, improvement in obesity-related co-morbidities,
      complementary aspects of safety, effectiveness and treatment satisfaction of both treatment
      groups will be assessed and compared.

      A two year, parallel, two phase, two group, open-label, randomized controlled trial design
      for patients with severe and complex obesity who are referred to Tier 3 obesity service
      (including patients who are referred to Tier 3 service as part of the bariatric surgery
      pathway). This first phase of the study (first 52 weeks after randomization) will determine
      whether the targeted use of LIRA 3 mg in combination with the standard care provided in Tier
      3 setting will result in more participants attaining ≥15% weight loss compared to the
      standard care alone in a Tier 3 service. The second phase of the study will aim to provide
      some evidence whether the patients who will achieve ≥15% weight loss of baseline weight
      during the first phase of the study, will be able to maintain ≥15% weight loss for another
      52 weeks with the use of standard care plus LIRA 3mg compared to the standard care alone.
      Further, budget impact, cost-effectiveness, improvement in obesity-related co-morbidities,
      complementary aspects of safety, effectiveness and treatment satisfaction of both treatment
      groups will be assessed and compared (see Section 6.4.2).

      The study is intentionally designed to reflect &quot;real- world&quot; case and each Tier 3 provider
      may require different number of visits for their programme. However, appointments for data
      collection, appointments with dietician for the first 8 weeks, and appointments with
      clinician for application of the stopping rules of LIRA 3mg and Liraglutide supply will be
      standardised for all the five sites.

      Visit at Week (-)4 for initial screening, assessment for eligibility and consent to
      participate in the study by the healthcare professional. A second screening visit could take
      place regarding eligibility if indicated (for example for repeat blood pressure measurement
      or repeat bloods).

      Phase I The first phase of the study will start with a visit at week 0 for randomisation, a
      clinician and dietician assessment. Patients on the LIRA 3mg group will be started on
      Liraglutide in accordance with a pre-specified titration protocol. Further visits will be at
      weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 for data collection, appointments with the dietician (weeks 2, 4 and
      8), monitoring of side effects for patients on LIRA 3mg and monitoring of dose escalation
      (weeks 2 and 4 only). A visit at week 16 for data collection, assessment by the clinician
      for the 1st stopping rule and possible extension of prescription for LIRA 3mg for
      participants in the standard care plus LIRA 3mg group who lost ≥5% of their baseline weight.
      Further appointments will take place for data collection and monitoring of side effects (for
      patients on LIRA 3mg) at 20 weeks. A visit at week 32 after randomisation for data
      collection and assessment by the clinician for the 2nd stopping rule and possible extension
      of prescription for LIRA 3mg (or highest tolerated dose). Further visit for data collection
      and LIRA 3mg supplementation at 40 weeks and another assessment by the clinician for the 3rd
      stopping rule at 52 weeks after randomisation (for visualisation see Figures in Appendices
      2,3).

      Phase II The second phase of the study (extension of the study) will include visits for all
      the participants at week 78 for data collection and supply of LIRA 3mg for those who will
      continue on LIRA 3mg for the second year and at week 104 for data collection (last visit for
      all the participants). Visits at weeks 65 and 91 will take place only for participants who
      are on treatment with LIRA 3mg in order to have further prescriptions and supply of LIRA 3mg
      (Appendices 2,3).

      Patients will be screened (Visit 1) up to 28 days prior to the Baseline Visit (Day 0). The
      first phase of the study will begin with the randomisation at Baseline Visit and the
      initiation of treatment according to the protocol for each group. Study participation will
      end after the visit at 104 weeks, which is the end of the second phase of the trial. Maximal
      time for the study will be 110 weeks (Screening up to 4 weeks before baseline plus 104 weeks
      study plus allowed margin 2 weeks).

      6.2 Intervention Participants will be randomised in a 2:1 fashion to either the intervention
      or control arm (2 intervention: 1 control).

      The intervention arm is standard care in Tier 3 service plus a LIRA 3mg protocol with
      stopping rules. The LIRA 3mg protocol is described below (see also Appendix 2).

      LIRA 3mg will be prescribed to all the participants in the intervention arm for the first 16
      weeks. Dose escalation of Liraglutide will occur as tolerated according to a pre-specified
      titration protocol, from 0.6mg to a maximum of 3.0mg. Liraglutide dose will be initiated at
      0.6 mg and then increased to 1.2 mg in week two, 1.8 mg in week three, 2.4mg in week four
      and 3.0 mg in week five. The same diet and lifestyle options as in the control arm, which
      may include meal replacements, will be prescribed. Participants in the intervention group
      will be aware that they will not continue with LIRA 3mg treatment (or highest tolerated
      dose), if they do not achieve the target weight loss in the first 16 weeks.

      First stopping rule:

      After 16 weeks on the medication, only those participants who have lost ≥5% of their
      baseline weight will be offered further treatment with LIRA 3mg (or highest dose tolerated)
      for a further 12 weeks.

      Second stopping rule:

      After 32 weeks on the medication, only those participants who have lost ≥10% of their
      baseline weight and are already on treatment with LIRA 3mg will be offered another 24 weeks
      on LIRA 3mg. (or highest dose tolerated)

      Third stopping rule: After the first year of treatment (week 52 since randomisation), only
      those participants who have achieved ≥15% of their starting weight and are already on
      treatment with LIRA 3mg will be offered another 52 weeks on LIRA 3mg (or highest dose
      tolerated).

      Participants who fail to reach the thresholds to continue LIRA 3mg treatment, or who chose
      to stop the treatment, will continue to be offered the standard care provided by the Tier 3
      equivalent service.

      Participants will remain routinely in the Tier 3 (or equivalent) service in line with NICE
      guidance. After the end of the Tier 3 programme they may be offered treatment options,
      including bariatric surgery, as per NICE guidance and according to the decision of the local
      Tier 3 Multidisciplinary Team. At the end of the second year, all the participants will be
      asked to come back for further assessment.

      The control group will receive standard care in a specialist obesity service (Tier 3 or
      equivalent). Participants in the standard care group will follow the best medical care
      provided by that service which typically involves dietary advice to reduce energy intake
      (and may include a period of partial or total meal replacement), accompanied - if available
      - by a physical activity programme, both supported by behavioural change techniques with
      regular professional contacts. Clinician input will include the medical assessment of
      participants for severe and complicated obesity and the prescription of anti-obesity drugs
      (such as orlistat) as per local Tier 3 service policy. Participants will remain routinely in
      the Tier 3 (or equivalent) service in line with NICE guidance. After the end of the Tier 3
      programme they may be offered further treatment options, including bariatric surgery, as per
      NICE guidance and according to the decision of the local Tier 3 Multidisciplinary Team. At
      the end of the second year, all the participants will be asked to come back for further
      assessment.
