    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability
      of treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) in adults with chronic hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection who are on dialysis for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).

Non-response (HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment)
Virologic relapse:
Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at last on-treatment visit.</description>
