      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate safety, efficacy and tolerability of
      treatment with sofosbuvir (Sovaldi®)/velpatasvir (Epclusa®; SOF/VEL) for 12 weeks in adults
      with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are on dialysis for End Stage Renal
      Disease (ESRD).
