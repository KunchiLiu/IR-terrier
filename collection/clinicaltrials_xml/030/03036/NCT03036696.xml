      Interview pregnant and lactating mothers in the Gainesville, FL area to optimize; clinical
      study recruitment and retention, patient-centered outcomes, and stool collection procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interview study that will enroll mothers during 26 weeks or greater of pregnancy
      and lactating mothers less than 1 year. The focus of the interviews will assess recruitment,
      patient-centered outcomes, and stool collection procedures via individualized interviews and
      data collection. Participants will be recruited from the greater North Central Florida area.
      Data collection will include questionnaires/surveys as well as minimal risk non-invasive
      biological samples such as stool, human milk, saliva, vaginal swab, and urine collection.
      Participants will be seen at the University of Florida Clinical and Translational Science
      Institute.

    <measure>Strategies for recruiting and retaining pregnant women and lactating mothers into clinical research studies (CRTs) will be measured by way of interview.</measure>

    <description>Interviews will be analyzed to determine the efficacy of common strategies used to recruit pregnant and new mothers to CRTs, challenges or barriers that would preclude women from enrolling and participating in CRTs, their preferences for incentives, as well their preference and methods related to non-invasive sample collection.</description>

    <description>Pregnant women will be interviewed and asked to provide feedback on common strategies used for recruitment, challenges that would preclude them from enrolling and participating in CRTs, their preferences for incentives, and preferences for methods related to non-invasive sample collection.
The following will be collected during the interview: self-reported behavioral data, maternal fasting human milk (HM), and maternal- infant microbiome collection.</description>
