  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study in participants with colorectal cancer
      (CRC), and consists of Part A (dose regimen finding), followed by Part B (dose expansion).
      Part A (dose regimen finding) will involve dose escalation and possible dose interval
      modification to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) and schedule. Part B (dose expansion) will enroll additional participants who will be
      treated with a study drug dose at or below the MTD determined in Part A.
