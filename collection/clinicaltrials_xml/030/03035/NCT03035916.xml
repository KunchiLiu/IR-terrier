      This study evaluates the effect of transversus abdominis plane(TAP) block combined with
      general anesthesia on perioperative stress response in patients undergoing radical
      gastrectomy. One third of participants will receive TAP block combined with general
      anesthesia, another one third of participants will receive epidural anesthesia combined with
      general anesthesia, while the rest will receive only general anesthesia.

    <textblock>
      Clinically, combining epidural with general anaesthesia may confer many advantages to
      patients undergoing major thoracic, abdominal or orthopaedic surgery. Epidural anaesthesia
      can attenuate sympathetic hyperactivity and the stress response, maintain bowel peristalsis,
      spare the use of opioids, and facilitate postoperative feeding and physiotherapy. However,
      establishing epidural anesthesia is not without risks and contraindications, including
      refusal by the patient, technical failure, unintentional dural puncture, waist and back pain
      and local anaesthetic toxicity. When neurologic complications do occur, the resulting
      morbidity and mortality is considerable. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, is another
      new regional anesthesia technique, has been introduced as an abdominal wall block capable of
      providing effective analgesia, reducing opioid consumption, and lessening opioid-related
      side effects. In addition,TAP block, somewhat as a pre-emptive analgesia approach, is a way
      of pain intervention before noxious stimulation which has been reported to be potent to
      attenuate the stress response. Although the analgesia efficiency of TAP block has been
      widely studied, its effectiveness to suppress stress response has little comparison with
      classic epidural block and general anesthesia. Unlike epidural anaesthesia, TAP block is
      easy to administer and lower incidence for side-effects.The investigators hypothesize that
      the TAP block reduces the stress response of surgery to the similar extent to epidural
      anaesthesia when combined with a standard general anaesthesia for abdominal surgery.
