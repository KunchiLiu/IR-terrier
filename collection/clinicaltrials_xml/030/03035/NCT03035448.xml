      If participant agrees to take part in this study, during an already-scheduled office visit,
      they will complete 3 questionnaires about their symptoms, their emotional health, and if
      they have ever participated in psychiatric or psychology services. These questionnaires
      should take about 9 minutes to complete.

      All participants will watch 2 short videos. The videos show actors playing a doctor,
      counselor, and patient, discussing psychology service options. Each video is about 1 minute
      and 30 seconds long and will discuss the same material, but the content of each video will
      be different. The order in which they are presented will be randomly assigned (as in the
      flip of a coin). Participant will have an equal chance of seeing either video first.

      After participant watches the second video, they will complete 3 questionnaires about
      whether they think 1 of the videos was better than the other, and about their attitude
      toward psychology services. These questionnaires should take about 4 minutes to complete.

      Length of Study:

      It should take about 16 minutes to watch both videos and to complete all questionnaires.
      Participation on this study will be over after participant has completed the last
      questionnaire.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
