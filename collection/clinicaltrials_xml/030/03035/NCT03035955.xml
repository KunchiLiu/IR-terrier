  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effects of azelaic acid on Demodex folliculorum
      counts and disease condition via a split face design in approximately twenty patients with
      mild to moderate rosacea. The investigators hypothesize that treatment of rosacea with
      azelaic acid will lead to a decreased Demodex folliculorum count as well as an improvement
      in lesion count and redness.

      This is a split face, randomized, single blind, single center study. Male and female
      (non-pregnant, non-nursing) subjects, age 18 or greater, with mild to moderate
      papulopustular facial rosacea, with bilateral facial involvement, and no more than two
      nodules will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 by the study coordinator using a
      standard randomization table to receive azelaic acid twice daily on either the left side or
      the right side of the face and no treatment on the other side of the face. Subjects must
      have a positive Demodex folliculorum standardized skin surface biopsy, defined at &gt;5 mites
      cm at Screening/Baseline on at least one of two different SSSB specimens on bilateral sides
      of the face. The SSSB test location will ideally be on the cheek, but may be done in the
      most disease involved area. Subjects will be seen at Screening/Baseline, Week 1 and Week 4.
      Standard topical washout periods will be observed. At each visit, rosacea will be evaluated
      by lesion count, IGA and two Demodex SSSB tests done on each side of the face. Safety will
      be monitored at each visit using the Investigator Skin Irritation Assessment.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a split face, randomized, single blind, single center study. Male and female (non-pregnant, non-nursing) subjects, age 18 or greater, with mild to moderate papulopustular (based on Investigator Global Assessment) facial rosacea, with bilateral facial involvement, and no more than two nodules will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 by the study coordinator using a standard randomization table to receive azelaic acid (Finacea® Gel, 15%) twice daily on either the left side or the right side of the face and no treatment on the other side of the face.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects, ages 18 and over, with mild to moderate paulopustular
             rosacea with bilateral facila involvement, who agrees to participate and provide
             written consent.

          -  Positive Demodex folliculorum SSSB, defined as &gt;5 mites/cm on at least on of two
             different SSSB specimens on bilateral sides of teh face.

          -  Have an IGA of mild to moderate rosacea, rating between 2 and 5.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of topical therapy for rosacea or other skin conditions on the face within two
             weeks of Baseline.

          -  Use of oral medications for the treatment of rosacea that have been started or
             altered within the past three months.

          -  Presence of a concurrent medical condition or skin condition, which is determined by
             the investigator to potentially interfere with study outcomes or patient assessments.

          -  Subjects with known allergy or sensitivity to azelaic acid gel or components therein,
             such as propylene glycol.

          -  Subjects with known allergy or sensitivity to cyanoacrylates or formaldehyde.

          -  Presence of more than two nodules.

          -  Female subjects who are not postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile or
             willing to practice effective contraception during the study. Reliable methods of
             birth control are: abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, DepoProvera,
             tubal ligation or vasectomy of the partner in a monogamous relationship. An
             acceptable, though less reliable, method involves the careful use of condoms and
             spermicidal foam or gel and/or a cervical cap or sponge. Nursing mothers, pregnant
             women and women planning to become pregnant while on study are to be excluded.
