    <textblock>
      CONNECT-HF is a large-scale, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial to evaluate the
      effect of 2 quality improvement (QI) initiatives compared with usual care on heart failure
      (HF) outcomes and HF quality of care metrics at 1 year after discharge for participants
      hospitalized with acute HF and reduced ejection fraction (EF). The interventions will
      include both a health-system engagement group (direct) and a participants engagement group
      (digital).

      CONNECT-HF will be a large-scale, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial to evaluate
      the effect of 2 quality improvement (QI) initiatives compared with usual care on heart
      failure (HF) outcomes and HF quality of care metrics at 1 year after discharge for
      participants hospitalized with acute HF and reduced ejection fraction (EF). All participants
      in the trial will be consented for longitudinal follow-up as part of the CONNECT-HF registry
      on clinical outcomes, medication use, and participant-centered outcomes, including quality
      of life (QOL) assessments, at 6 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge.

      Two QI initiatives evaluated in this trial are:

      A health-system engagement strategy (direct) that will involve site visits and ongoing
      mentoring from teams of healthcare professionals with specialized training and field
      experience to help health systems and individual hospitals to design local quality
      improvement plans.

      A participant engagement strategy (digital) of mobile applications utilizing behavioral
      tools to reinforce health behaviors, including self-monitoring/self-management and
      medication adherence.

      After the index hospitalization for HF, longitudinal information on management (ie, HF
      medications), QOL assessments, and resource utilization will be collected.

      Follow-up will occur via a centralized telephone interview by trained personnel via the DCRI
      Call Center. At each interview, participants will be asked to report current medications,
      rehospitalizations, and QOL assessments. Based on participant-reported events, medical
      billing data for rehospitalizations, emergency department visits, and procedures will be
      obtained.

      Quality of life assessments will include the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)
      and EuroQOL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D).

    <measure>Improvement in an opportunity-based composite score of adherence to quality metrics for HF.</measure>

    <description>The opportunity-based composite score will be created to grade the quality of care provided. The numerator will be the number of times that good care is provided; the denominator will be the number of opportunities available. The score will consist of the following quality metrics assessed at the time of hospital discharge and during outpatient follow-up:
Use of evidence-based specific β-blockers at ≥ 50% target dose
ACE-I, ARB, or sacubitril/valsartan use at ≥ 50% target dose
Aldosterone antagonist use
Anticoagulation use in participants with atrial fibrillation
In participants with an LVEF ≤ 35%, implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement including cardiac resynchronization therapy placement for participants with sinus rhythm, LBBB, and a QRS ≥ 150 ms
Attendance at 1 or more of the following: a multidisciplinary HF disease management program, a cardiac rehabilitation program, or HF group educational classes</description>

    <measure>Improvement in an opportunity-based composite score for adherence to site-level HF discharge quality measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The opportunity-based composite score will be created to grade the quality of care provided. The numerator will be adherence to medications; the denominator will be the number of opportunities available. The per-opportunity adherence rate will consist of the following quality metrics assessed at the time of hospital discharge:
ACE-I, ARB, or sacubitril/valsartan prescription at discharge
ß-blocker prescription at discharge
Discharge instructions addressing activity level, diet, discharge medications, follow-up appointment, weight monitoring, and how to respond to a change in symptoms
LVEF assessment
Smoking cessation counseling
