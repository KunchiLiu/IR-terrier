      treatment.

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, information from their medical record will
      be collected at each of their standard of care clinic visits. This information may include
      things like participant's height, weight, BMI, medical history, and performance status
      (their ability to perform normal daily activities).

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant's weight and performance status will be
      measured at standard of care clinic visits.

      The distress plan for managing patients who endorse depressive symptoms as indicated by
      PHQ-9 is to treat them with anti-depressants, social support will be also provided

      Every 3 months for up to 1 year, participant will be contacted by a member of the study
      staff, either by phone or during a regularly-scheduled standard of care visit at MD
      Anderson. Participant will be asked about their health and weight, about any falls or
      injuries they may have had, and about any hospitalization or ER visits they may have had. If
      participant is called, the phone call should last about 15 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      Participation on the study will be over after the 12-month follow-up visit or phone call.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 284 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
