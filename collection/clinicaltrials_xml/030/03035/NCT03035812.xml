    <textblock>
      Metabolic acidosis recovers a wide range of diseases in which an oral alkalinization could
      be useful. This therapeutic intervention has been said to increase extracellular volume
      leading to rising blood pressure. No prospective data has been published in clinical
      routine. Here, investigators propose to follow patients in which an oral alkalinization is
      indicated: blood pressure, body weight, and a clinical evaluation of the extracellular
      compartment will be performed at the beginning and during the follow-up of participants. The
      principal criterion of evaluation will be the variation in the extracellular compartment.

    <textblock>
      Metabolic acidosis recovers a wide range of diseases - chronic kidney diseases,
      nephrolithiasis, or others - in which an oral alkalinization could be useful. Oral
      alkalinization could be performed or by bicarbonate contained in alkaline-based waters or
      drug therapies or by citrate. This therapeutic intervention has been said to increase
      extracellular volume leading to rising blood pressure, especially due to the amount of daily
      sodium load. No prospective data has been published in clinical routine, studying its
      effects on extracellular volume nor the blood pressure control.

      Here, investigators propose to follow patients in which an oral alkalinization is indicated:
      blood pressure, body weight, and a clinical evaluation of the extracellular compartment will
      be performed at the beginning and during the follow-up of participants. Initial recorded
      data will be: age, gender, prescription (indication, kind of alkali therapy, volume and
      duration), body weight, body length, a clinical appreciation of the extracellular
      compartment, blood pressure, comorbidities, drug therapy, blood and urine composition. The
      recorded follow-up will be: the adherence to treatment, body weight, body length, a clinical
      appreciation of the extracellular compartment, blood pressure, adverse events, blood and
      urine composition.

      The principal criterion of evaluation will be the variation in the extracellular
      compartment.
