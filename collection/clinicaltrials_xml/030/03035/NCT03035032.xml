        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient for whom the physician has decided to initiate treatment with a Luteinizing
             Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) agonist in standard clinical practice

          -  Biopsy-proven prostate adenocarcinoma

          -  Locally advanced prostate cancer with biochemical relapse radical prostatectomy or
             radiotherapy.

          -  Hormonal treatment-naive advanced or metastatic prostate cancer patient who has not
             received chemotherapy and has no plans to undergo treatment with chemotherapy at
             study entry.

          -  Patient who indicates that once the study is completed, he expects having access to
             androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), either medical or surgical, within the local
             healthcare system (either through public/ private health insurance or out of pocket
             payment).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with castrate resistant prostate cancer

          -  Patient who previously underwent bilateral orchiectomy

          -  Patient who has received prior treatment with LHRH analogues

          -  Prior or concomitant treatment with systemic chemotherapy. A patient where there is a
             likelihood to receive systemic chemotherapy should not be enrolled

          -  Life expectancy of &lt; 1 year due to comorbidities

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical trial within one month prior to
             study entry or during the duration of the study

          -  Patient who plans to receive intermittent ADT at the time of study entry

          -  Patient receiving non-palliative radiotherapy within 3 months prior to study entry

          -  Patient receiving adjuvant ADT in combination with definitive radiotherapy

          -  Patient with metastatic hormonal treatment-naive prostate cancer, for whom
             chemo-hormonal treatment (combination of Docetaxel and ADT) is indicated.

          -  Patient with hypersensitivity to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), GnRH agonist
             analogs or any of the components of ELIGARD®

          -  Patient with any contraindication for ELIGARD® use based on local prescribing
