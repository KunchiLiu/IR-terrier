    <description>The primary endpoint will be the proportion of all attempted home self-injections that were successfully performed by the study participant at home (ie, not in the clinic under direct HCP supervision) and on schedule (13 week interval +/- 1 week). If a subject decides to discontinue Sayana Press as her contraceptive method, and therefore does not attempt one or more injections, these scheduled injections would not be included in the denominator for the primary endpoint</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             self-injection at home;

          -  women who are likely to be successful on a DMPA self-injection program, based on the
             opinion of the investigator;

             supervised by the investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees involved in the
             conduct of the study;

          -  participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 30 days prior

             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
             the judgement of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry
