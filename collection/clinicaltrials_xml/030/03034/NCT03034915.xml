  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is characterized by an airflow limitation, which is not fully reversible, usually
      progressive and accompanied by chronic cough, sputum production and dyspnea, which can be a
      major cause of disability and anxiety associated with the disease. In addition, COPD is
      associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Pharmacologic therapy is used
      to improve lung function, reduce symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of
      exacerbations, and also to improve health status and exercise tolerance.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, double dummy, 3-arm parallel group study
      to compare umeclidinium/vilanterol (62.5/25 microgram [mcg], once daily), umeclidinium (62.5
      mcg, once daily), and salmeterol (50 mg, twice daily) in male and female subjects with COPD.
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function for
      subjects treated with UMEC/VI compared with UMEC for 24 weeks.

      Approximately 2424 subjects will be randomized across 3 parallel arms in 1:1:1 ratio.
      Subjects will be stratified based on long-acting bronchodilator usage during the run-in
      period (none, one or 2 long-acting bronchodilators per day). Subjects will receive either
      UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 microgram [mcg] once daily) administered via the ELLIPTA®
      dry powder inhaler (DPI) and placebo twice daily via DISKUS® DPI; or UMEC (62.5 mcg once
      daily) administered via the ELLIPTA DPI and placebo twice daily via DISKUS DPI or salmeterol
      (50 mcg twice daily [BID]) administered via the DISKUS DPI and placebo once daily via
      ELLIPTA DPI. The duration of the study will be 29 to 31 weeks including a pre-screening
      period of 2 weeks, run-in period of 4 weeks, treatment period of 24 weeks and follow-up
      period of 1 week.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 at Week 24 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 167 (Week 24).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in self-administered computerised (SAC) transient dyspnea index (TDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The TDI measures changes in the subject's dyspnea from Baseline. SAC TDI provides a continuous measure of change in dyspnea using a visual analogue scale to record responses. The score depends on ratings for three different categories: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. Questionnaires will be completed at clinic visits and in the electronic diary. SAC TDI will be used to measure the change from Baseline (SAC BDI) at Weeks 4, 12 and 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of TDI responders according to SAC TDI score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A responder is defined as a &gt;=1 unit improvement in SAC TDI score. Responder analyses will be done to provide comparative data between the treatment groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total scores of respiratory Symptoms (E-RS)-COPD and its subscales: breathlessness, cough and sputum and chest symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The E-RS: COPD is an 11-item scoring instrument, intended to capture information related to the respiratory symptoms of COPD, i.e., breathlessness, cough, sputum production, chest congestion and chest tightness. The E-RS: COPD has a scoring range of 0-40, where higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. Three subscales of the E-RS: COPD are used to describe different symptoms: dyspnea, cough and sputum and chest symptoms. ER-S: COPD is completed daily approximately 2 hours before bed-time from screening until the last clinic visit.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in St George's respiratory questionnaire-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease specific (SGRQ-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SGRQ-C measures the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on HRQoL of an individual with COPD. Total score as well as the individual domain scores: symptoms, activity and impacts will be produced. SGRQ-C will be completed by subjects at Baseline (Day 1) and at Weeks 4, 12 and 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of responders according to SGRQ-C total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A responder is defined as a 4 point or greater reduction from Baseline in SGRQ-C total score. SGRQ-C will be completed by subjects at Baseline (Day 1) and at Weeks 4, 12 and 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in COPD assessment test (CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT is an 8-item questionnaire used to measure the health status of subjects with COPD. Subjects will rate their experience on a 6-point scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment) with a scoring range of 0-40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. CAT will be completed by subjects at Screening, Baseline (Day 1) and at Weeks 4, 12 and 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of responders according to CAT</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  40 years or older at date of signing informed consent at Screening Visit 1

          -  Outpatient with a diagnosis of COPD

          -  Persistent airflow limitations as indicated by a pre and post-albuterol/salbutamol
             FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;0.70 and a post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1 of &gt;=30% to &lt;=80%
             predicted normal values at Screening Visit 1.

          -  A CAT score of &gt;=10 at Screening Visit 1

          -  Current or former cigarette smokers with a history of cigarette smoking of &gt;=10
             pack-years (number of pack years = [number of cigarettes per day / 20] multiplied by
             number of years smoked [e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes
             per day for 20 years both equal 10 pack-years]). Former smokers are defined as those
             who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1. Pipe and/or cigar
             use cannot be used to calculate pack-year history.

          -  Male and female subjects are eligible to participate in the study. A female subject
             is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative urine
             human chorionic gonadotrophin test), not lactating, and at least one of the following
             conditions applies: non-reproductive potential defined as pre-menopausal females with
             documented tubal ligation or documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with
             follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion or hysterectomy or documented
             bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea. In questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone and estradiol levels consistent with menopause must be tested.
             Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt
             will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they
             wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to
             allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment.

        A female subject with reproductive potential is eligible to participate if she is not
        pregnant and agrees to follow one of the highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy
        in females of reproductive potential from 30 days prior to the first dose of study
        medication and until (at least five terminal half-lives or until any continuing
        pharmacologic effect has ended, whichever is longer) after the last dose of study
        medication and completion of the follow-up visit. The investigator is responsible for
        ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use methods of contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent prior to study participation.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  A current diagnosis of asthma (Subjects with a prior history of asthma are eligible
             if they have a current diagnosis of COPD, which is the primary cause of their
             respiratory symptoms).

          -  Subjects with known alpha-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD

          -  Subjects with active tuberculosis are excluded. Subjects with other respiratory
             disorders (e.g., clinically significant: bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis,
             pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases) are excluded if these conditions
             are the primary cause of their respiratory symptoms.

          -  Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease as per investigator
             assessment); stable chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence
             of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric
             varices, or persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis; chronic stable hepatitis B and C
             (e.g., presence of hepatitis B surface antigen or positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if
             subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Subjects with unstable or life threatening cardiac disease. The investigational
             product should be used with caution in subjects with severe cardiovascular disease.
             In the opinion of the investigator, use will only be considered if the benefit is
             likely to outweigh the risk in conditions such as myocardial infarction or unstable
             angina in the last 6 months, or unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia
             requiring intervention in the last 3 months, or New York Heart Association Class IV
             heart failure.

          -  The investigator will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal
             electrocardiogram (ECG) finding in relation to the subject's medical history and
             exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. Subjects
             with the following abnormalities are excluded from participation in the study: atrial
             fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 beats per minute (bpm), sustained or
             non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, second degree heart block Mobitz type II or
             third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted).

          -  Subjects with medical conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention,
             prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder neck obstruction will be excluded unless, in the
             opinion of the study physician, the benefit outweighs the risk.

          -  Any subject who is considered unlikely to survive the duration of the study period or
             has any rapidly progressing disease or immediate life-threatening illness (e.g.,
             cancer). In addition, any subject who has any other condition (e.g., neurological
             condition) that is likely to affect respiratory function will not be included in the
             study.

          -  Hospitalization for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. Pneumonia
             and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least 14 days
