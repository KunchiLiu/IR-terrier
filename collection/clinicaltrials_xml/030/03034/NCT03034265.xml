      The purpose of this study is to determine the concentration and interindividual variability
      of urinary exosomal sodium channels and of plasma angiotensins in patients with
      difficult-to-treat arterial hypertension and to investigate their dependency on clinical
      sampling conditions and other related laboratory parameters.

      Background:

      Difficult-to-treat hypertension is characterized by uncontrolled blood pressure despite 2 or
      more antihypertensive drugs. In many of these cases, abnormal renal Na and volume handling
      plays a central pathogenetic role. Arterial vasoconstriction and renal function are
      regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and its effector hormones
      angiotensin II and aldosterone. Both control renal tubular function and Na excretion by
      specific cellular receptors. Blocking the renin-angiotensin-system pharmacologically is
      therefore a standard approach to treat hypertension. However, there is a great clinical need
      to improve the classification of hypertensive patients and to predict patient sensitivity to
      different therapeutic strategies more precisely by new and specific biomarkers.

      Ang fragments generated by non-canonical enzymatic pathways such as Ang III co-exist with
      Ang I and Ang II in plasma. Their profile could help reclassify hypertensive patients, for
      example by differentiating salt and RAAS-related mechanisms with greater predictive power
      than plasma renin and aldosterone alone. Furthermore, urinary exosomes are small membrane
      vesicles (&lt;0.1 μm) shed into the urine by tubular epithelial cells. They contain tubular Na
      channels known as targets of furosemide and thiazide drugs used to treat volume overload and
      hypertension by increasing tubular sodium excretion. Cellular Na channel concentration in
      the tubule is regulated by Ang II and aldosterone. Urinary exosomal Na channel abundance may
      therefore provide valuable information about tubular function otherwise not rendered by
      standard laboratory tests. These biomarkers could improve the classification of patients
      with difficult-to-control hypertension and inform treatment decisions. As a prerequisite for
      the design of future validation studies, however, their concentration and interindividual
      variability is still not known in this patient group.

      Study aim:

      This study aims to determine the concentration and interindividual variability of urinary
      exosomal sodium channels and of plasma angiotensins (candidate biomarkers) in patients with
      difficult-to-treat arterial hypertension and to determine their dependency on sampling
      conditions, dietary salt intake, and plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations.

      Candidate biomarker definition:

        -  Plasma Ang peptides planned for determination in the study are Ang I and II and its
           metabolites Ang 2-10, 2-8, 3-8, 1-7, 2-7, 3-7, 1-5 (Ang peptide profile).

        -  Urinary exosomal Na channel proteins planned for determination in the study are Na+-Cl−
           cotransporter (NCC), epithelial sodium channel subunits alpha, beta, gamma (ENaC) and
           Na-K-Cl cotransporter type 2 (NKCC 2).

      Study type:

      This is an investigator initiated, monocentric observational pilot study in 24 ambulatory
      patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension who meet the inclusion criteria and none of
      the exclusion criteria.

      Setting:

      The study is performed at the outpatient hypertension clinic of the University clinic for
      nephrology, hypertension and clinical pharmacology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital,
      Bern, Switzerland.

      Objectives:

        -  The primary objective of the study is to determine the concentration and
           interindividual variability of urinary exosomal Na channels and of plasma angiotensin
           peptides under standardized clinical sampling conditions in patients with
           difficult-to-treat hypertension.

        -  The secondary objectives of the study are

             1. to determine the association of these candidate biomarkers with urinary Na
                excretion, plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations, and aldosterone-to-renin
                ratios on clinical visit 2,

             2. to assess the repeatability of biomarker determinations under spontaneous (visit
                1) compared to standardized clinical sampling conditions (visit 2).

      Study plan and procedures:

      The concentration of the candidate biomarkers are determined in blood and spot urinary
      samples obtained on the first clinical visit (visit 1) and again under standardized
      laboratory conditions on the second clinical visit (visit 2) after stopping RAAS inhibitory
      drugs, diuretics and other interfering drugs for an appropriate period of 5-31 days.

      Determinations of candidate biomarkers are made in parallel with clinical blood and urine
      tests performed routinely on these two visits. The routine laboratory determination on visit
      2 include supine and standing plasma renin and aldosterone measurements in the morning after
      1 h rest and again after 1 hour walking. Furthermore, 24h urinary Na and K excretion are
      determined.

      Biological samples are processed according to standardized laboratory protocols. Plasma Ang
      peptides are determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Urinary exosomal proteins
      are determined by Western-Blot using specific antibodies. Clinical data and routine
      laboratory results for visits 1 and 2 are obtained from clinical patient files.

      Recruitment of participants:

      Consecutive ongoing participant recruitment is performed in daily clinic practice by the
      investigators who check referrals for potential eligibility.

      Duration of individual study participation:

      Individual study participation begins with study inclusion on visit 1 and ends with the
      completion of visit 2.
