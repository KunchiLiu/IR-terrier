    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the efficacy and safety of deep brain rTMS,
      (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) H7-Coil treatment as add on treatment, is as good as the
      FDA cleared, H1-Coil, in subjects with major depressive disorder that have been previously
      unsuccessfully treated with antidepressant medications.

      This is a prospective, 6 week, double blind, randomized, controlled, multi-center trial. The
      study will explore the safety and efficacy of deep brain rTMS (Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation) H7-Coil treatment and demonstrate that it is as good as the FDA cleared,
      H1-Coil treatment as add-on for a treatment with antidepressant drugs (a bi-therapeutic
      treatment ) in subjects with major depressive disorder that have been previously
      unsuccessfully treated with antidepressant medication.

      Approximately 105 subjects will be enrolled in the study. The study population consists of
      subjects with MDD who have failed adequate medication treatment and who are in a current
      depressive episode.

      The patients will be of all racial, ethnic and gender categories, ranging from 22 to 68
      years of age, and have HDRS-21â‰¥20. Outpatients will be recruited from both academic and
      private research centers.

      The study duration is 8 weeks, with a 2 week period of screening and baseline, followed by 4
      weeks of 5 daily treatments and 2 weeks of biweekly treatments. Mood and mental state will
      be carefully monitored through standard psychological scales and assessments during the
      screening and baseline and throughout treatment.
