  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether comprehensive remote follow-up in HF patients
      with CRT will reduce the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality or worsening heart failure
      hospitalizations, whichever comes first, when compared to basic remote monitoring, over a
      27-month follow-up.

    <description>Remote monitoring of CRT-P and CRT-D is activated. The physician will only receive the notifications related to technical events and ventricular arrhythmias.

    <description>Remote monitoring of CRT-P and CRT-D is activated, as well as remote assessment of symptoms and signs. In addition to notifications related to technical events and ventricular arrhythmias, the physician will receive notifications related to heart failure parameters, atrial arrhythmias, and patient's symptoms and signs. Therapy will be added or changed in response to these notifications, and/or to the symptoms and signs observed during ambulatory visits.</description>

          -  Patient more than 18 years old, newly implanted, in accordance to the latest European
             guidelines, with a CRT-P or CRT-D device (upgrading is tolerated but no device
             replacement), with Home-MonitoringÂ® activated

          -  Patient willing and able to comply with the protocol and who has provided written
             informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lead model under advisory

          -  Non-functional lead except particular case of non-functional or deactivated right
             atrial lead due to atrial fibrillation

          -  Known drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Pregnant woman or woman who plan to become pregnant during the trial (the data will
             be collected by querying the patient without a pregnancy test is required)

          -  Participation (ongoing or planned during the trial) in another interventional
             clinical study, and/or another remote monitoring and/or follow-up concept, unless
             authorized by the Executive Committee

          -  Participation (ongoing or planned during the trial) in an investigational HF program
             (e.g. PRADO, PIMPS, OSICAT, CARDIAUVERGNE)

          -  Estimated life-expectancy, regardless of the cardiovascular condition, &lt;1year

          -  Patient under- or planned for - ventricular assistance

          -  Patient not living in Metropolitan France and/or not geographically stable
