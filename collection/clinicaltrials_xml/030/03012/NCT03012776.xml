      The purpose of this trial is to assess whether the Total Posterior Spine System (TOPS
      System) is more effective than transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) when used to
      stabilize a single lumbar level (L2 - L5) following surgical decompression in patients
      diagnosed with (1) at least moderate lumbar spinal stenosis, and (2) Grade 1
      spondylolisthesis (or retrolisthesis), and (3) thickening of the ligamentum flavum or
      scarring of the facet joint capsule.

      Success will be assessed by means of a composite endpoint that measures improvement in in
      patient reported outcomes and the absence of any major device related complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative spine disease is a normal part of the aging process and can cause pain and
      significantly limit normal movement. The most commonly diagnosed condition is Lumbar Spinal
      Stenosis (LSS) which presents with pain, and often weakness or numbness in the buttocks
      and/or lower extremities that is worsened with standing and walking. For patients that do
      not respond to conservative treatment decompressive surgery is indicated. When LSS is
      accompanied by a diagnosis of degenerative spondylolisthesis, fusion of the affected segment
      is often added to prevent progression of the instability that may accompany the removal of
      bony elements as part of the decompression. While decompression and fusion have been shown
      to significantly improve patient outcomes, when compared to decompression alone, fusion has
      been associated with several comorbidities such as adjacent level degeneration and
      pseudoarthrosis.

      The TOPS System was designed as an alternative to fusion and is a motion preserving
      posterior spine implant designed to provide dynamic stabilization to a single lumbar spine
      segment following decompression surgery.

      Patients meeting all of the entry criteria will be randomized (2:1) to receive either the
      TOPS System or TLIF following decompression surgery. Patients will be followed for 5 years
      and the composite primary endpoint will be assessed at 2 years following index surgery.
