  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, single dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Latin-square
      design with 5-period (full) crossover study with subjects randomized to treatment sequences.
      Subjects will complete all 5 Periods.

      During each Period, subjects will come to the clinical research unit (CRU) and remain
      overnight before being dosed with a single dose of either lasmiditan, alprazolam, or placebo
      in the morning. Cognitive testing and driving simulation will be conducted post dosing.
      Subjects will have a washout of at least 5 days between each Period.

      This study is designed to test non-inferiority of lasmiditan doses relative to placebo, with
      an alprazolam test versus placebo to confirm the sensitivity of the simulator to detect
      treatment effects.
