      The current study aims to test the safety of Repeated Magnetic Stimulation (RMS) treatment
      for dry eye. Patients will be asked to undergo a one-time treatment with Epitech Corneal
      Magnetic Stimulation Device on one eye. Changes will be monitor for over a study period of 3
      months.
