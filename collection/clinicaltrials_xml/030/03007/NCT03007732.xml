  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-comparative open-label multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining definitive
      prostatic radiotherapy (RT) and pembrolizumab with or without intratumoral SD-101 in
      patients with newly diagnosed hormone-naive oligometastatic prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A safety lead-in for each treatment arm will be performed prior to full 1:1 randomization
      into each arm. Definitive RT to the whole prostate gland will be delivered via high-dose
      rate (HDR) brachytherapy on Day 1 and Day 8 (+7 days) of Cycle 1 pembrolizumab in each arm.
      Immediately before RT, SD-101 will be delivered to the dominant prostatic lesion on Day 1
      and Day 8 (+7 days) of Cycle 1 pembrolizumab in Arm 2. SD-101 will be administered
      intratumorally in concert with placement of the HDR brachytherapy catheters. Pembrolizumab
      will be continued for a total of 13 cycles, until disease progression, or unacceptable
      toxicity, whichever occurs first. Patients will receive 3 months of androgen deprivation
      therapy (ADT) run-in, followed by combined androgen blockade (CAB) for 9 months, then
      discontinuation of ADT. Primary outcome is to evaluate the rate of prostate specific antigen
      (PSA) &lt; nadir +2 ng/mL at 15 and 24 month from the start of treatment among patients with
      non-castrate levels of testosterone (&gt;150 ng/dL). Serum, archival prostate biopsy, mandatory
      baseline metastatic tumor biopsy, and optional repeat biopsy at time of progression, will be
      obtained to characterize circulating and intratumoral immune responses.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          -  Be &gt;=18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Oligometastatic disease. In order to be eligible, the patient must have a total of &lt;4
             metastatic bone and/or metastatic lymph node sites based on bone and/or soft tissue
             lesions as defined by any of the following:

          -  Bone metastases will be defined by bone imaging. If the patient has technetium bone
             scan and/or NaF PET performed, either study may be used for documenting metastases;
             both scans do not need to show the number of metastases required for study entry. For
             patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate
             will be counted as a site of metastasis.

          -  Distant metastatic lymph node disease. A lymph node ≥1 cm in shortest dimension will
             be noted as involved with disease. Distant metastatic lymph nodes will be determined
             as any lymph nodes outside the confine of the true pelvis. For patients undergoing
             PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate will be counted as a
             site of metastasis.

          -  Any other soft tissue lesion deemed by the physician to be consistent with distant
             metastatic disease i.e. lung and liver metastases. For patients undergoing PSMA PET,
             only PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate will be counted as a site of
             metastasis.

          -  Treatment naïve, defined as less than 2 months of standard of care ADT (e.g. GNRH
             agonist or antagonist with or without antiandrogen) for metastatic hormone-sensitive
             prostate cancer prior to enrollment

          -  No prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer

          -  Not a candidate for or refuse chemotherapy

          -  No prior prostatectomy or prostatic radiation

          -  PSA &gt;2 ng/mL at baseline or prior to initiation of hormonal therapy

          -  Baseline testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL if patient has not initiated hormonal therapy

             formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks
             (preferred) or at least 15 slides, with an associated pathology report. If archival
             prostate tissue are unavailable or cannot be obtained, a repeat TRUS prostate biopsy
             is not required for eligibility.

          -  Consent to undergo a mandatory baseline biopsy of a metastatic tumor, if clinically
             feasible and safe to perform. Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies of bone
             or lymph node. At least three cores should be obtained. A fine needle aspirate is not
             acceptable. Subjects have the option of consenting to a repeat biopsy at time of
             progression.

          -  Consent to undergo mandatory intra-operative prostatic core biopsies at the time of
             HDR brachytherapy with or without SD-101 therapy, depending on study arm.

          -  The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus is unknown. Men treated or
