      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of naloxegol and
      to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer.
      Naloxegol may relieve some of the side effects of opioid pain medication and fight off
      future growth in the cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine feasibility and safety of long-term administration of two doses of a
      peripheral opioid receptor antagonist in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) receiving first-line pemetrexed-based chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether patients randomized to one or both of the two study drug arms have
      less decline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than patients randomized to placebo.

      II. To estimate the difference in the pain levels and opioid/non-opioid analgesic
      requirements between patients receiving naloxegol or placebo.

      III. To estimate the difference in the adverse peripheral effects of opioids (e.g.
      constipation, nausea/emesis, dry mouth and urinary retention) between patients receiving
      naloxegol or placebo.

      IV. To explore whether there is a signal that naloxegol may be associated with longer
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      V. To evaluate the difference in discontinuation rate of chemotherapy due to adverse events
      (AEs) and deaths attributable to chemotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine if MOR expression or activation is a prognostic marker in advanced NSCLC, and
      whether its expression/activation can be used to guide pain management.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I (LOWER DOSE NALOXEGOL): Patients receive lower dose naloxegol orally (PO) once daily
      (QD) and placebo PO QD. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP II (HIGHER DOSE NALOXEGOL): Patients receive placebo PO QD and higher dose naloxegol
      PO QD. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP III (PLACEBO): Patients receive placebo PO QD. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
