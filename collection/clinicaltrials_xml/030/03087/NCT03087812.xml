  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in which data on consecutive patients who undergo
      ureterorenoscopy with the use of a flexible ureterorenoscope are collected. In total 4 new
      ureteroscopes are used (2 from Olympus and 2 from Storz) to study the durability of the
      ureteroscopes and the possible microbiological load.

      This is an observational study in which data on consecutive patients who undergo
      ureterorenoscopy with the use of a flexible ureterorenoscope are collected. In total 4 new
      ureteroscopes are used (2 from Olympus and 2 from Storz) to study the durability of the
      ureteroscopes and the possible microbiological load.

      Before the procedure is started the endoscope is tested for its microbiological load in two
      different ways:

      Shake the tip of the flexible ureterorenoscope 5 seconds in a sterile container filled with
      100 cc of NaCl 0.9% Using a well-fitting single use sterile brush or sponge brush the biopsy
      channel. Shake the brush during 5 seconds in a sterile container filled with 100 cc of NaCL
      0.9%.

      After the procedure is finished, the endoscope is tested for its microbiological load in two
      different ways:

      Shake the tip of the flexible ureterorenoscope 5 seconds in a sterile container filled with
      100 cc of NaCl 0.9% Using a well-fitting single use sterile brush or sponge brush the biopsy
      channel. Shake the brush during 5 seconds in a sterile container filled with 100 cc of NaCL
      0.9%

      Before dismissal of the hospital and at the first visit of the patient in the outpatient
      clinic:

      Sample a urine culture and measure the temperature of the patient Mark and date the samples.
      Complete the lab form with all required information and the reason for sampling. Transfer
      all samples to the lab as soon as possible but at least within four hours after collecting
      the samples.

      As for the clinical efficacy during each procedure a detailed questionnaire about the use of
      each ureteroscope is filled out. This includes the ease of use making mention on quality of
      the image, torque, flexibility and durability.

      Data will be collected through electronic case report forms (eCFRs), with use of an online
      Data Management system (DMS).

    <description>To evaluate descriptive data on factors that may affect the durability of the flexible ureteroscopes. Factors measured are treatment time, treatment indication and anatomical location in the urinary tract, method of ureteroscope insertion number and type of accessory instrumentation through the working channel, difference in users, number of forcing the scope during the procedure and the number of disinfections.</description>
