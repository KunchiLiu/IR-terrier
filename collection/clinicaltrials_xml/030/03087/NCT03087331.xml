    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, pre post, pilot cohort study to be conducted in patients with chronic
      pain, which is defined as pain that lasts beyond 3 months. To accomplish the primary and
      secondary objectives of the study, three phrases will be designed and completed during three
      months

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of community-based pharmacist interventions on
      the quality of life of patients with chronic pain as determined by self-reported pain levels
      using an established scoring system. Participating pharmacists will enroll chronic pain
      patients from their normal practice to receive a consultation, which consists of an
      assessment of their current pain, a medication review, and education about their condition.
      Based on the information provided by the patient, the pharmacist will prepare a care plan,
      contact the patient's prescriber, and, in conjunction with the prescriber, implement the
      plan to help relieve their pain. Follow-up assessments will be done after 2 weeks, and 3
      months.
