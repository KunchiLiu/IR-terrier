  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often involved in cardiovascular
      diseases. In our study, we want to promote sport practice to reduce that burden in the first
      place, and all associated diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases) consequently. The aim of
      this clinical trial is to determine which type of program, conducted in a digital
      environment associating a mobile application and individual coaching, better improves
      exercise habits over a 3-month period in overweight or moderate obese OSA patients.

      With automation equipment and the comfort, it has brought, less natural physical activities
      are required and people do not take the time to do some. Therefore, obesity, associated with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) up to 60% of cases, has become a heavy burden on the society
      and the healthcare system, besides the fact that it often involves cardiovascular diseases.
      Assistance is urgently needed and the investigators want to promote sport practice to reduce
      that burden in the first place, and all associated diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases)
      consequently. In order to do that, the investigators will integrate sport in the patient
      pathway and support in his/her involvement. This last point means that a link between
      medical and sport specialists should be established, and this is missing today.

      This study aims to reconcile the world of patients and the world of sport, by offering a
      trajectory and an organization that help patients to initiate physical activity.

      The investigators plan to measure the physical activity of overweight or moderate obese,
      apneic patients in the different programs at the end of the 3-month period by physical
      activity objective parameters: number of steps/day.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

        -  Evaluate the effect of the different programs of sport &quot;prescription&quot; on patient
           motivation, over a 3-month period by a motivational questionnaire.

        -  Analyze the cost effectiveness of the different programs of sport &quot;prescription&quot; over a
           3-month period.

        -  Evaluate the effect of the different programs of sport &quot;prescription&quot; on weight and
           blood pressure (BP), assessed by home self-measurements each month, over a 3-month
           period and recorded in the application.
