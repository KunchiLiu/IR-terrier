  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spreading of transcatheter aortic valve implantation has paradoxically increased the
      spectrum of indications for balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty is
      currently used as destination therapy for patients excluded from transcatheter aortic valve
      implantation, as bridge to transcatheter aortic valve implantation or to surgical aortic
      valve replacement, or as a stratification tool for selected high-risk patients who cannot be
      immediate candidates for transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Moreover, it has been
      recently showed that transcatheter aortic valve implantation without balloon aortic
      valvuloplasty is encumbered by an increased risk of cerebral embolization. However, balloon
      aortic valvuloplasty has a complication rate comparable to transcatheter aortic valve
      implantation, mainly related to access site or temporary pacemaker implantation. Thus, a
      transradial mini-invasive approach with rapid pacing through the 0,035 inch left ventricular
      support wire could be extremely appealing.

    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis with indication to aortic balloon
      valvuloplasty will be enrolled. An ad hoc informed consent for the procedure will be
      obtained from all patients.

      This is a prospective observational study. The Investigators will include patients where
      aortic ballloon valvuloplasty is attempted by radial access and without temporary pacemaker
      implantation. The aim is to register and monitor the effectiveness and safety of this
      approach. Details regarding management of radial access and pacing with 0.035 wire can be
      found in the references reported below. The primary endpoint will be the 30-day serious
      adverse events rate (intraprocedural death, stroke, coronary dissection/occlusion,
      moderate-severe aortic regurgitation, hypotension requiring resuscitation and intubation or
      cardioversion, tamponade, permanent pacemaker, serious vascular complications requiring
      intervention).

      The safety endpoint will be the absence of intra- or periprocedural major complications in
      transradial balloon aortic valvuloplasty, namely balloon entrapment or compartment syndrome
      requiring surgical intervention. The feasibility endpoint will be a procedural success rate
      â‰¥90%. The efficacy endpoint will be a reduction of the mean invasive gradient &gt;30%. At
      baseline, Handgrip strength test will be performed and angiography of the instrumented arm
      will be performed at the beginning and at the end of the procedure. All patients will be
      prospectively followed-up for at least 30 days and all adverse events will be recorded.
      During the 30-day follow-up visit two independent blinded operators will evaluate radial
      artery patency by ultrasonography and perform handgrip strength test in in both arms in all
      patients.

      According previous studies, the cumulative occurrence of 30-day serious adverse events after
      transfemoral aortic balloon valvuloplasty with temporary pacing is around 20%. The half of
      these complications can be attributed to femoral access-site or temporary pacemaker
      implantation. We speculate that transradial mini-invasive balloon aortic valvuloplasty can
      reduce them. Accordingly, to validate this hypothesis, we will enroll 204 patients (alpha
      0.05, power 80%).
