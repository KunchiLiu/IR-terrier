  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small-scale study of the effects on microbes in the human gut of adding high-fiber
      snack foods to usual diet. The snack foods are being provided by Mondelez International,
      Inc. Eight pairs of dizygotic twins, discordant or concordant for obesity, will participate
      in the study. They will complete 3 successive experiments in which their regular diet is
      supplemented by consumption, over a 6-week period, of high-fiber snack foods. Each
      experiment will involve (i) two weeks consuming regular diet (fecal sample collected
      weekly); (ii) one week consuming one snack food per day (approximately 7 g fiber, collection
      of all fecal samples), (iii) one week consuming two snack foods per day (approximately 14 g
      fiber, collection of all fecal samples), (iv) four weeks consuming three snack foods per day
      (approximately 20 g fiber, collection of all fecal samples); and (v) two weeks consuming
      only regular diet (weekly collection of fecal sample). For each experiment, participants
      will also provide a fasting blood sample during the free diet phase at the end of the week
      just before initiation of snack consumption, and a fasting blood sample at the end of the
      last week of snack consumption. Participants will also collect one first morning urine
      sample weekly throughout the study. During week 2, participants will also collect first
      morning urine samples for 3 consecutive days. Similarly, they will collect first morning
      urine samples for the last 3 consecutive days of the last week of snack consumption. The
      study will test the effects of the different fiber-rich snacks on the composition and
      metabolic properties of the gut microbial community in lean and obese subjects.
