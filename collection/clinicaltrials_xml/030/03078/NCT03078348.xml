    <intervention_model_description>In this modified &quot;block&quot; random assignment, all individuals recruited from the same geographic unit will receive the intervention assigned to that area in order to reduce intervention contamination. Individuals will not be made aware of their randomization (intervention) condition until after baseline assessment. The research assistants will also be assigned at random to work with one geographic area (i.e., one intervention condition) in order to reduce risk of intervention contamination by study staff.</intervention_model_description>

          -  Participants must provide at least two forms of contact information (mailing address,
             home telephone or cell phone or email address), and contact information of a
