    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RA101495 in patients with
      Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). There will be two groups of patients in the
      study: the first group will include patients who have never received eculizumab for
      treatment of PNH. The second group will include patients who have received treatment with
      eculizumab for at least 6 months prior to the study. Patients will be treated with RA101495
      for 12 weeks.
