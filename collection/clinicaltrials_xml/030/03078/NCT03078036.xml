      BREAKOUT -International Breast Cancer Biomarker, Standard of Care and Real World Outcomes
      Study BREAKOUT is a prospective cross-sectional cohort study of human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients who have started 1st line
      systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. The study will estimate the prevalence of germline breast
      cancer susceptibility gene in an otherwise unselected population, describe the treatments
      administered and estimate the associated clinical outcomes of overall survival and
      progression-free survival amongst mutation carriers within the context of a low poly ADP
      ribose polymerase inhibitor treatment setting. Other exploratory analyses may be undertaken
      to describe somatic breast cancer susceptibility gene and other homologous recombination
      repair gene mutations.

      Background/Rationale: Within the setting of metastatic human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 negative (HER2-ve) breast cancer limited epidemiological data exist on the
      prevalence of pathogenic mutations of breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) and other
      homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes. There are also limited data on the treatments
      and clinical outcomes of patients with such germline and somatic genetic profiles,
      particularly within this setting. This epidemiologic study will estimate the prevalence of
      germline breast susceptibility gene (gBRCA) mutations among metastatic HER2-ve patients who
      have commenced 1st line systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy and, at that time, are considered to
      have exhausted hormone therapy options (if hormone receptor positive [HR+ve]), per
      investigator's opinion. Among those patients with a gBRCA gene mutation, treatment patterns
      and clinical outcomes will be described. This study may also explore the prevalence of
      somatic BRCA (sBRCA) mutations and other HRR gene mutations among metastatic HER2-ve
      patients who have commenced 1st line systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. The treatment patterns
      and clinical outcomes may be described among those patients with a sBRCA gene mutation and
      those with other HRR gene mutations.

    <description>If unavailable from the patient medical records, gBRCA gene mutation status will be tested as aligned to local clinical practice using a blood sample obtained preferably during routine clinical practice.

    <description>Archival tumour specimen will be requested from all patients in the informed consent, but is not required for study enrolment (optional consent). Where sufficient archival tumour specimen is available and patients have consented to tumour specimen testing, FoundationOne Dx genomic profiling may take place as follows:
Tumour Specimen: Acceptable samples include formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue (preferred) or FFPE specimens, including core needle biopsies, fine-needle aspirates and effusion cytologies.
Tumour Testing (optional): archival tumour specimens, where available, will be tested for mutations in HRR genes including BRCA1 and BRCA2 and other genomic alterations using the FoundationOne Dx genomic profile.</description>

    <description>Patients who test positive for a gBRCA gene mutation, and/or sBRCA or other HRR gene mutations (optional testing), will be followed prospectively for assessment of treatment patterns and associated clinical outcomes up to 30-months.
- Patients who test negative for gBRCA gene mutations, sBRCA and other HRR gene mutations, no further data will be collected post baseline. Patients presenting other genomic alterations that are identified by the FoundationOne Dx genomic profile will not continue beyond baseline as part of this study.</description>
