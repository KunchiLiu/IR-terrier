  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, Phase 1b, adaptive, clinical study to
      assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary
      therapeutic activity of RO6874281 in participants with unresectable advanced and/or
      metastatic RCC. The study will consist of dose-escalation part and extension part.
