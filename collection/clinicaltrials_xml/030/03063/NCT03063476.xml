      This sub-study aims to assess the effect and breakdown of lysine administration,
      specifically examining whether it leads to increased plasma 2-AAA in healthy humans.

    <textblock>
      The significance of diabetes and related co-morbidities as considerable health concerns in
      the US and worldwide is clearly supported by the high incidence (estimated 9.3% of the US
      population), mortality burden (7th leading cause of death in the US), and rising costs ($245
      billion/year). Strategies to identify individuals at high diabetic risk, and to modulate
      disease processes in these individuals before the onset of overt disease, would have a
      significant impact in reducing mortality, morbidity and healthcare costs. For this approach
      to be successful, early markers of disease that predict at-risk individuals before onset of
      dysregulated glycemic control are required, as well as discovering novel pathways for
      therapeutic targeting.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate a novel biomarker, α-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA),
      which may influence the risk of diabetes. 2-AAA has been identified as a novel predictor of
      diabetes development in humans, identifying at-risk individuals before any detectable
      glucose abnormalities. 2-AAA is a naturally occurring metabolite in the body, and it has no
      known adverse effects at normal physiological levels. 2-AAA is generated in the body from
      the breakdown of lysine. Lysine is one of the twenty essential amino acids, meaning that it
      is essential for human function, but that our body cannot manufacture it. Thus, it is
      acquired from dietary sources (such as meat, eggs, soybeans and legumes), with a recommended
      daily intake of 30 mg/kg/day. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are
      what allow our cells, organs and body to maintain structure and function. The investigators
      are interested in whether 2-AAA is increased in the body after consumption of lysine.

      The investigators' specific aim is to determine whether acute lysine administration leads to
      increased plasma 2-AAA in humans. Catabolism of lysine leads to generation of 2-AAA. In this
      study, the investigators will determine whether a single dose of 13C isotope labeled lysine
      leads to increased plasma 2-AAA present in the blood and urine of humans. In this sub-study,
      the investigators will ask 2 lean, healthy subjects (preferably individuals who participated
      in a previous study visit) to drink a beverage containing C-13 labeled lysine and the
      investigators will measure the level of 2-AAA in their blood plasma and urine at baseline
      (before ingestion) and serially post-ingestion. The amount of lysine subjects will be given
      is equivalent to that which is found in a 5 oz. serving of beef. This sub-study will allow
      us to further establish and understand the relationship between lysine and 2-AAA in healthy
      subjects, and inform future studies on how to study the effects of 2-AAA on diabetes risk.

    <description>Two healthy subjects will be enrolled and each will undergo study procedures at one visit. After screening and consent have been conducted over the phone, subjects will participate in the study procedures. Subjects will arrive in a fasting state (no eat or drink for 8 hours, excluding water). Following collection of blood pressure, height, weight, and a urine and blood sample, subjects will be given an oral bolus of C-13 labeled lysine (5 g) in 50 ml water. This amount of lysine is equivalent to that which is found in a 5oz. serving of beef. Subjects will provide additional urine and blood samples serially post-ingestion. Because blood draws will be collected through an IV, Normal (0.9%) Saline (NS) will be infused at a rate of approximately 10 ml/hr to flush the canula prior to each blood draw.
All subjects will undergo the same procedures and interventions.</description>

To keep the vein open for blood collections, we will infuse Normal (0.9%) Saline (NS) at a rate of approximately 10ml/hr in order to keep the line open.</description>
