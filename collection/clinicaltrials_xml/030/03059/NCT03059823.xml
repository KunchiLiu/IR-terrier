  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this Phase 1 study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of
      MGA012 and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MGA012 administered on either every
      two week or every four schedules of administration among patients with solid tumors.
      Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the anti-tumor activity of MGA012 will also be
      assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 dose-escalation and dose expansion study to
      define a MTD, describe preliminary safety, and to assess PK, immunogenicity, and potential
      anti-tumor activity of MGA012 administered on either every two week or every four week
      schedules in patients with relapsed/ refractory or unresectable locally/ advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors.

      In the initial phase of the study, two dose schedules will be assessed in dose escalation,
      once every two weeks and once every four weeks administration of single agent MGA012.
      Following the establishment of an MTD, additional patients will enroll in dose expansion
      cohorts of specific tumor types.
