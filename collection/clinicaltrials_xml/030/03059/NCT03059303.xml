    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability of single-dose
      Simeprevir (SMV), Odalasvir (ODV), and AL-335 when administered as an fixed-dose combination
      (FDC) compared with the single agents when administered together, and to assess the effect
      of multiple-dose lansoprazole and omeprazole on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      SMV, ODV, and AL-335 when administered as an FDC.

             height in meters) of 18.0 to 32.0 kilogram per meter (kg/m^2), extremes included, and
             a body weight not less than 50.0 kg

          -  Participant must have a blood pressure (supine after at least 5 minutes rest) between
             90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90
             mmHg diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are

             antibody (anti-HCV) positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or tests
             positive for HBsAg or anti-HCV at screening
