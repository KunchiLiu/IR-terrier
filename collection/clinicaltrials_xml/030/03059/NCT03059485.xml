    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a cancer vaccine called Dendritic Cell/AML Fusion vaccine
      (DC/AML vaccine) as a possible treatment for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML).

      The interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Dendritic Cell/AML Fusion vaccine (DC/AML vaccine)

        -  Durvalumab
    </textblock>

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the DC/AML vaccine as a
      treatment for any disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab as a treatment
      for AML.

      In this research study, the investigators are determining if the DC/AML vaccine can be used
      safely in subjects with acute leukemia after finishing chemotherapy, and whether the DC/AML
      vaccine is capable of producing immune responses against leukemia alone and in combination
      with Durvalumab. Cancer cells are foreign to the body and have unique markers that
      distinguish them from normal cells. These markers can potentially serve as targets for the
      immune system. An immune response is any reaction by the immune system; a complex system
      that is responsible for distinguishing us from everything foreign to us, and for protecting
      us against infections and foreign substances.

      The Dendritic Cell Fusion Vaccine is an investigational agent that tries to help the immune
      system to recognize and fight against cancer cells. Unlike a standard vaccine that is used
      to prevent infections, cancer vaccines are being studied to see if they can fight cancers
      that are already in the body. Laboratory studies have shown that when dendritic cells and
      tumor cells are brought together, the dendritic cells can stimulate immune responses against
      the tumor and, in some cases, cause the tumor to shrink.

      Durvalumab is a check point inhibitor which is being combined here to further amplify the
      immune activity of the vaccine. It is a monoclonal antibody, which is known to take the
      brakes off the immune system to restore immunity. In this study, the investigators will add
      Durvalumab in combination with the vaccine with the hope of improving immunity even further.
