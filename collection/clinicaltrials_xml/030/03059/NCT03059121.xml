    <textblock>
      In this observational study, the investigators will examine the changes in body composition
      in HIV-infected subjects before and after initiation of HIV treatment. The effects of
      lifestyle factors on body composition changes after antiretroviral therapy (ART) are
      unknown, and as such, investigators will use this prospective observational cohort to study
      relationships between lifestyle factors, including diet, physical activity and illicit drug
      use, with changes in body composition after ART. In addition, the effect of the body fat
      changes will be correlated to changes in cardiometabolic indices such as endothelial
      function and coronary calcium scoring.

        Subjects will be primarily recruited from the practice of the investigator (the Special
        Immunology Unit (SIU) at University Hospitals Case Medical Center). All subjects seen at
        the Special Immunology Unit who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be approached
        for study participation. Subjects who see physicians outside of the SIU may be eligible as
        well if they contact the study team and meet the inclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection as documented by any licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by Western
             blot at any time prior to study entry. HIV-1 culture, HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1
             RNA, or a second antibody test by a method other than ELISA is acceptable as an
             alternative confirmatory test

          -  Provides written informed consent and is capable of reading and comprehending the
             informed consent

          -  Is not currently taking antiretroviral therapy and has never been on such treatments
             in the past. Exception would be for subjects who had been in the past on â‰¤30 days
             cumulative antiretrovirals, as long as these were stopped &gt;6 months prior to study
             entry

          -  Is planning on starting antiretroviral therapy as part of routine clinic care

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or lactation
