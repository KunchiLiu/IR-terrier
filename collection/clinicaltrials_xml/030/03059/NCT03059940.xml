  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to offer lung cancer screenings to smokers who
      want to change their smoking behaviors. All eligible participants will receive counseling
      and be offered at least one form of smoking cessation drug. The different forms of
      counseling and treatment will be compared.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will have a
      CT scan of participant's chest to look for signs of lung cancer. Participant will receive
      the results 1-4 days after the scan. If there are any abnormal areas, participant will be
      referred to participant's regular doctor for follow-up. No matter what the results are,
      participant will be advised to quit smoking.

      Participant will have a decision-making conversation with the CT scan provider. Participant
      will discuss the risks and benefits of smoking cessation, as well as what participant
      expects out of such treatment. Participant will watch a short (about 9 minutes) video about
      lung cancer, CT scans, and smoking cessation. This conversation will last about 15 minutes.
      Participant will then receive a referral for intervention and counseling to quit smoking.

      Participant will be prescribed an anti-smoking drug. This may be either nicotine replacement
      therapy (such as a patch, gum, or lozenge) or an oral drug (such as varenicline or
      buproprion). The study doctor will tell participant when and how much of participant's
      anti-smoking drug participant should take each time.

      Participant will also then have about 5 smoking cessation counseling sessions over the next
      12 weeks. Each session will last about 30 minutes, in which participant will set a quit
      date, prepare for participant's quit date, and discuss coping skills for dealing with
      smoking &quot;triggers&quot; after participant's quit date. Participant will also discuss challenges
      participant may have with quitting.

      Study Visits:

      Participant will have 3 additional study visits, at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after
      the CT scan. At all study visits:

        -  Participant will complete questionnaires about several topics, including depression,
           suicide, and participant's smoking behavior. These questionnaires should take about
           30-45 minutes in total to complete.

        -  Urine and/or saliva will be collected for a routine test to check participant's
           cotinine, nicotine, and/or anabasine levels. Cotinine is a chemical released in
           participant's body when it breaks down nicotine and will show whether and how much
           participant has recently smoked. Anabasine is a chemical that shows if nicotine is
           found in the blood due to a nicotine replacement therapy or from tobacco use.

        -  Participant's CO level will be measured.

      This is an investigational study. All smoking cessation drugs being used in this study are
      FDA approved and commercially available. It is investigational to compare them. The study
      doctor can describe how they are designed to work.

      Up to 1260 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
