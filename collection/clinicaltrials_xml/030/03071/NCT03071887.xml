    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to refine and pilot the Relaxation Response Resiliency (3RP)
      intervention for women age 50 and over who are living with HIV, a group especially burdened
      by stressors related both to aging and living with chronic disease. The investigators will
      adapt the 3RP resiliency intervention to the needs of this population and conduct
      preliminary testing of the group intervention via an open pilot study.

      Overview.

      Participants will be HIV-infected women (N=up to 40) age 50 or over. Women will be recruited
      from the Infectious Disease unit of MGH. Based on the investigators' qualitative work, the
      investigators will deliver an adapted version of the 3RP resiliency intervention to groups
      of 5-8 HIV-infected women age 50 and over. The 3RP intervention will consist of 8 weekly
      sessions of 90 minutes each focused on skills training to build and enhance resilience. The
      investigators will conduct baseline and post-treatment quantitative assessments, in addition
      to individual exit interviews to solicit feedback on the intervention. These data will be
      used to inform the design of a future randomized pilot study.

      Study procedures.

      Participants (N = up to 40) will be HIV-infected women age 50 or over with low resilience
      levels (as measured during study screening). Participants will be recruited via study flyers
      (posted in the infectious disease clinic at MGH and in the waiting areas of Boston area
      community organizations) and provider referral (MGH). Once an individual expresses interest
      in the study, a research assistant will screen that individual to assess study eligibility
      criteria. Individuals who meet inclusion criteria will be invited to sign informed consent
      and complete an in-person baseline assessment. Participants will then complete the 8-week
      intervention (described below), a post-treatment assessment, and an individual in-depth exit
      interview to provide feedback on their experience in the study.

      3RP Intervention:

      Once enrolled in the study, participants will complete eight, 90-minute weekly group
      sessions of the 3RP intervention. Sessions will focus on developing an understanding of
      stress sources and physiology, and on developing a regular practice of eliciting the
      relaxation response (RR) and learning cognitive behavioral and positive psychology skills to
      enhance resiliency to long-term stress. Participants will be encouraged to practice skills
      (RR practice, thoughts records to learn adaptive thinking) between group sessions.

    <description>The 3RP blends stress management principles, cognitive behavioral therapy, and positive psychology. The 3RP focuses on 3 major areas: (1) eliciting the relaxation response; (2) increasing stress awareness; and (3) promoting adaptive strategies. The 3RP intervention currently consists of eight, 90-minute weekly group sessions. The investigators plan to adapt the intervention to address common concerns for older, HIV-infected women, including: stress of managing a chronic long-term, life threatening illness; additional medical comorbidities; pain and fatigue; stigma and social isolation; depression and anxiety; and sexuality concerns.</description>
