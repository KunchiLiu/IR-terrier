      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether pemafibrate administered twice
      daily will delay the time to first occurrence of any component of the clinical composite
      endpoint of:

        -  nonfatal Myocardial Infarction (MI)

        -  nonfatal ischemic stroke

        -  hospitalization for unstable angina requiring unplanned coronary revascularization; or

        -  Cardio Vascular (CV) death.
