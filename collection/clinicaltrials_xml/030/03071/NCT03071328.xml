      The purpose of this study is to plan the delivery of the PVSRIPO therapeutic poliovirus in a
      future prostate cancer clinical trial. Virus-free, diluted iodinated contrast will be
      injected intra-tumorally under CT fluoroscopy guidance into bone, lymph node, and liver
      metastases in subjects with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC), and pre
      and post-injection CT images will be obtained to determine the injection parameters needed
      for optimal distribution throughout metastases of a given size. A biopsy of the metastatic
      site will also be obtained to validate the expression of the poliovirus receptor CD155 in
      prostate cancer.

    <description>In order to plan the delivery of the therapeutic poliovirus in a future prostate cancer clinical trial, diluted iodinated contrast will be injected under CT fluoroscopy guidance into bone, lymph node, and liver metastases in subjects with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, and pre and post-injection CT images will be obtained to characterize the parameters needed for optimal distribution throughout metastases of a given size. To validate the expression of the poliovirus receptor CD155 in prostate cancer, a biopsy of the metastatic site (liver, lymph node) will be obtained at the time of contrast injection and will be stained for CD155 expression. Due to the sclerotic nature of prostate cancer bone metastases, a biopsy of the bone metastasis to be injected will be performed up to 2 weeks prior to study enrollment, in order to confirm tumor is present. Bone metastases will not be re-biopsied at the time of contrast injection.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Small cell or
             neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate are also permitted.

          2. Radiographic evidence of at least one bone, lymph node, or liver metastasis,
             measuring between 2 cm to 8 cm (short axis for lymph nodes, long axis for bone and
             liver metastases), that is amenable to iodinated contrast injection, as judged by the
             study radiologist

          3. For subjects undergoing contrast injection of a bone metastasis: histologically
             confirmed metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma must be present on a biopsy of the bone
             metastasis to be injected. Biopsy must be done within two weeks of Day 1.

          4. Adequate laboratory values:

               1. Platelets &gt; 75,000

               2. INR â‰¤ 1.5

          5. Age &gt; 18 years.

          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of intercurrent or past medical or psychiatric illness that would make
             participation in a research biopsy protocol difficult or not feasible at the
             discretion of the principal investigator or co-investigator(s).

          2. Cr &gt;2.0

          3. History of iodinated contrast allergy

          4. Requirement for anticoagulation with heparin, low molecular weight heparin,
             clopidogrel, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, warfarin, Aggrenox, fondaparux,
             ticagrelor, etc (aspirin and other NSAIDs are ok but should be held prior to biopsy
             in accordance with institutional standard of care)

          5. Any other contraindication to CT with iodinated contrast, as CT with contrast will be
             used in the study.
