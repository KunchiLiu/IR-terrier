      The objective of this clinical investigation is to collect high-resolution pulse oximetry,
      RRp, and RAM data in pediatric subjects for the purpose of algorithm optimization and to
      build a database of representative pulse oximetry and respiratory signal profiles for
      patients in this population.

          -  Fully developed skin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with skin abnormalities at the planned application sites that would
             interfere with sensor application.

          -  Subjects with pre-existing conditions and/or co-morbidities that would prohibit them
             from participating in the study due to unacceptable risks to their health and
             well-being, as determined by the Principal Investigator (PI).
