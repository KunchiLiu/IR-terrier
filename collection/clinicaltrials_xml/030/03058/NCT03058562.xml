  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effects and the safety of a single-dose of ABX-1431 HCl on
      tics and other symptoms of Tourette Syndrome.

      During the course of this study each patient will receive study drug once and placebo once.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. This
      study will assess the single dose effects of ABX-1431 HCl on tics and other symptoms of
      Tourette Syndrome.

      All patients will undergo a screening visit for enrollment criteria. Eligible patients will
      be treated with a single dose of ABX-1431 HCl or placebo followed by efficacy, safety and
      pharmacokinetics assessments. After a washout period of 1-3 weeks, patients will undergo
      identical procedures with the other treatment.

      This study will enroll 20 patients with a diagnosis of Tourette Syndrome OR chronic motor
      tic disorder.

             disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) OR generalized anxiety disorder,
             depression or post-traumatic stress disorder that is unstable or requires alteration
