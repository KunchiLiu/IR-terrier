  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the acceptability, tolerance and effect on metabolic control of PKU Start, a new
      Phe free protein substitute for the dietary management of PKU in infants from birth.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an assessment of ten (10) infants who require a protein restricted diet that is low
      in Phe. Infants who routinely use a Phe free infant formula as part of their dietary therapy
      will be recruited for a 28-day assessment of PKU Start, to evaluate tolerance and
      acceptability.

      The outcome of this assessment will be used in a submission to the regulatory authorities,
      Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS), for PKU Start to become reimbursable on
      prescription in the UK.

      The participant's dietitian will advise on an appropriate amount of PKU Start based on
      individual requirements. Parents/carers will be asked to substitute their usual Phe-free
      infant formula with PKU Start for one (1) month. The sponsor will supply PKU Start free of
      charge.

      Prior to starting PKU Start, parents/carers will be asked to record information about the
      infant's usual GI tolerance and feeding pattern for a period of three (3) days, to allow for
      comparison between their existing formula and PKU Start.

      They will be asked to record information about the following:

      Stools Vomiting and Spit-up Feed / Fluid Intake and Compliance Phenylalanine Levels Final
      Evaluation about the presentation of the product, ease of preparation and how PKU Start
      flowed through the teat of a bottle.

    <description>PKU Start is a powdered, phenylalanine-free, infant formula, containing essential and non-essential amino acids, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, minerals, trace elements and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPs); Arachidonic acid (AA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). It is suitable for use from birth.
The recommended amount of the product for each participant will be determined and prescribed by a dietitian.</description>

             parents

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed with mild PKU or hyperphenylalaninaemia (For the purposes of this study,
             'mild' is defined as phe concentrations between 120 and 600 µmol/L at diagnosis)
