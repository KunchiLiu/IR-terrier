  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to investigate the importance of patients' beliefs
      regarding staying active despite low back pain, among patients referred from general
      practice to secondary care treatment in Denmark. It is hypothesised that patients believing
      that staying active will help them recover will have higher odds of a 30%-improvement in The
      Roland Morris Disability score after 52 weeks compared to patients disagreeing that staying
      active will lead to better recovery.

      Background: According to international guidelines on low back pain (LBP), advice to stay
      active should be provided from healthcare professionals to all patients with LBP. However,
      provision of advice to stay active is reported to be diverse. Some primary care healthcare
      professionals believe that avoidance of activities and work will help the patient recover.
      Consequently some patients are not receiving optimal advice to stay active and may think
      that inactivity will help them and consequently achieve less favourable treatment outcomes.
      Thus, changing patients' beliefs are considered the key decisive factor to change actual
      behaviour, and by that improve the functional ability of the patients. This should reduce
      primary health care use and reduce referrals to the more expensive treatments in secondary
      care. The effect of patients' beliefs on their functional outcomes has to our knowledge
      never been studied in a population of patients with LBP being referred from primary care to
      secondary care treatment.

      Materials and Methods:

      This is a prospective cohort study. Data is collected from a consecutive series of 800 adult
      patients (18+), with low back pain as the dominant musculoskeletal complaint, referred from
      general practices in Central Denmark Region to the Spine Centre at Silkeborg Regional
      Hospital. Patients will be excluded in case of spinal fractures or malignancy.

      All patients seen at the Spine Centre receive a digital letter with a link to an online
      questionnaire to be completed approximately one week before their appointment at the Spine
      Centre. The questionnaire contains questions about their back pain history, present pain
      (Low Back Pain Rating Scale), disability (Rolland Morris Disability Questionnaire), quality
      of life (EQ-5D), fear-avoidance questions (Ã–rebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire), STarT
      Back Screening tool, questions on average level of physical activity, beliefs about physical
      activity in relation to back pain, advice received from health professionals about staying
      active, and questions about employment and housing situation. For those accepting
      participation the same questionnaire is forwarded by email 52 weeks after the initial visit
      at the Spine Center.

      Expected outcome and perspective: This study will bring knowledge about the associations
      between patient's disease perceptions and beliefs about staying active despite pain and
      their functional improvement. Furthermore, the study will clarify to what extent patients
      perceive to have been given advice to stay active by a primary care health professional.
      Although this study does not explain why some patients do not have guideline concordant
      beliefs, it will help inform health care professionals in primary care about the possible
      potential of an increased primary care attention towards the recommendation of staying
      active when patients have LBP.
