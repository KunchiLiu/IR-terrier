    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 240 males and
      non-pregnant females, 18 to 45 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity,
      and immunogenicity of two priming doses of M-001 followed by boosting with two doses of
      MF59-adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted monovalent influenza A/H7N9 IIV. The monovalent influenza
      A/H7N9 IIV was derived from the HA of the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) virus. Primary
      objectives: To assess the safety and reactogenicity of M-001 vaccine following receipt of
      two doses; To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza
      A/H7N9 vaccine (A/H7N9 IIV; two doses) administered with or without MF59 adjuvant following
      immunization with two doses of M-001 vaccine or placebo, and to assess the serum
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses to the A/H7N9 IIV virus after receipt
      of the first and second dose of MF59 adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted A/H7N9 IIV when
      administered to adults following receipt of placebo or two doses of M-001 vaccine.

      and immunogenicity of two priming doses of M-001 followed by boosting with two doses of
      MF59-adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted monovalent influenza A/H7N9 IIV. The monovalent influenza
      A/H7N9 IIV was derived from the HA of the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) virus. The
      duration of this trial for each subject will be approximately 15 months. Primary objectives:
      To assess the safety and reactogenicity of M-001 vaccine following receipt of two doses; To
      assess the safety and reactogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 vaccine
      (A/H7N9 IIV; two doses) administered with or without MF59 adjuvant following immunization
      with two doses of M-001 vaccine or placebo, and to assess the serum hemagglutination
      inhibition (HAI) antibody responses to the A/H7N9 IIV virus after receipt of the first and
      second dose of MF59 adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted A/H7N9 IIV when administered to adults
      following receipt of placebo or two doses of M-001 vaccine. Secondary Objectives: To assess
      unsolicited AEs following receipt of two doses of M-001 or placebo followed by receipt of
      two doses of MF59 adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted A/H7N9 IIV; To assess medically-attended
      adverse events (MAAEs) including new-onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs) and
      potentially immune-mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs) following receipt of two doses of
      M-001 or placebo followed by receipt of two doses of MF59 adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted
      A/H7N9 IIV, and to assess the serum neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses to the influenza
      A/H7N9 vaccine virus after receipt of the first and second dose of MF59 adjuvanted or
      non-adjuvanted A/H7N9 IIV when administered to adults following receipt of placebo or two
      doses of M-001 vaccine.
