  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bayesian models of perception represent a promising approach to describe information
      processing by the brain. Predictive coding hypothesizes a process in which top-down
      expectations are continuously compared across multiple hierarchical levels with bottom-up
      sensory inputs and the differences or error signals are propagated in a bottom-up direction.
      The investigators hypothesize that strong expectations, are best investigated in expert
      processes such as face and voice recognition in humans. Individuals in complex social
      systems need to extract socially relevant information in a fast and efficient manner; hence,
      the majority of humans constitute face, voice and gender experts. Nevertheless, linking such
      combined abilities to brain activity with regards to the predictive coding hypothesis has
      not been attempted.Our results suggest asymmetric contributions of visual and auditory
      signals to the gender classification task. This sensitive psychophysical procedure is
      implemented in a decoding approach using fMRI and multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The
      investigators plan to test whether cortical areas implicated in processing auditory and
      visual gender signals show similar asymmetries.
