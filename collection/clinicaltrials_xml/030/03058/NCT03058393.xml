  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to analyze how using the teach-back communication technique can
      improve patient:provider communication surrounding the discussion of knee replacement
      options, specifically Total Knee Arthroplasty(TKA) or a Unicompartmental Knee
      Arthroplasty(UKA). Orthopedic residents, fellows, physician assistants, and attendings that
      agree to participate will be consented and patients that have a clinical indication for a
      TKA and a UKA will be recruited from participating providers clinical schedules.
      Patient:provider interactions will be recorded and then the providers will attend a 1 hour
      education lecture about how to use teach-back. After attending the lecture, additional
      patient:provider interactions will be recorded and analyzed via a qualitative approach.
      Additionally, providers will participate in a semi-structured interview to capture their
      perceptions of teach-back and what challenges and benefits they may derive from using it.

    <description>We will assess this outcome directly from audio-recorded conversations. The transcript will be initially coded for talk related to knee replacement.
