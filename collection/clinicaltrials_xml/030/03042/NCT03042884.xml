      The goal of this research study is to learn how useful a wearable exercise tracker watch is
      to monitor participant's physical activity and learn if it can help to increase
      participant's physical activity.

      Inpatient:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will complete a questionnaire
      about any symptoms participant may have had in the past 24 hours. The questionnaire should
      take about 5 minutes to complete.

      Participant will receive a wearable exercise tracker watch and an iPod touch. Participant
      should wear the exercise tracker watch on participant's wrist for 24 hours a day (or as much
      as possible) while participant is in the acute inpatient rehabilitation unit, even when
      participant sleeps. The iPod touch will be used to sync the data from the tracker watch to
      the study's activity database so the study team can view participant's activity.
      Instructions on how to use the tracker and how to sync the trackers to the iPod touch will
      be given to participant and demonstrated by the research staff.

      The research coordinator will be available to help participant with any issues participant
      may have while taking part in the study and will call participant to answer any questions.
      Participant will be called on Day 3 of the study and again at the end of the study. These
      calls should last about 5 minutes each time.

      The wearable tracker will record participant's steps, sleep time, time spent doing physical
      activity, heart rate, and distance. Participant may choose to record the food participant
      eats and mood. Participant's ability to keep wearing the watch will be measured.

      Participant should wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on
      participant's wrist. If it becomes too bothersome, participant can take the watch off and
      put it back on after an hour.

      Participant should regularly clean the band and participant's wrist, especially after
      participant's rehabilitation sessions. Rinse the band with water or wipe it with a small
      amount of rubbing alcohol. Do not use hand soap, body soap, dish soap, hand sanitizers,
      cleaning wipes or household cleaners which could get trapped beneath the band and irritate
      participant's skin. Always dry the band well before putting it back on.

      If any of the devices are lost, stolen, or broken, participant should tell the study staff
      right away. They will be replaced at no cost to participant as long as participant has
      followed the study doctor's instructions. After participant completes the study, we ask that
      participant return the devices to the study staff.

      Within 24 hours before participant is discharged, participant will return the devices to the
      research staff. Participant will be asked to complete the same questionnaire about
      participant's symptoms and a questionnaire about participant's experience with the wearable
      exercise tracker. These questionnaires should take about 10 minutes total to complete. If
      participant is unable to complete them in person, participant will be given the option to
      complete them over the phone or electronically after participant has been discharged. If
      participant chooses to complete them electronically, participant's e-mail address will be
      collected so the survey link can be sent to participant. We ask that participant completes
      the questionnaires within 1 week after participant is discharged.

      Information will be collected from participant's medical records about participant's daily
      living at the beginning and at the end of the study. Basic information, such as
      participants's name, date of birth, race, gender, economic background, and medical record
      number will also be collected.

      Length of Study:

      Participation on this study will be over after participant completes the second set of
      questionnaires.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Outpatient:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will complete 2 questionnaires
      about any symptoms participant may have had in the past 24 hours and participant's current
      level of physical function. These should take about 10 minutes total to complete.

      Participant will receive a wearable exercise tracker watch and an iPod touch. Participant
      should wear the exercise tracker watch on participant's wrist for 24 hours a day (or as much
      as possible) while participant is in the acute inpatient rehabilitation unit, even when
      participant sleeps. The iPod touch will be used to sync the data from the tracker watch to
      the study's activity database so the study team can view participant's activity.
      Instructions on how to use the tracker and how to sync the trackers to the iPod touch will
      be given to participant and demonstrated by the research staff.

      The research coordinator will be available to help participant with any issues participant
      may have while taking part in the study and will call participant to answer any questions.
      Participant will be called on Day 3 of the study and again at the end of the study. These
      calls should last about 5 minutes each time.

      The wearable tracker will record participant's steps, sleep time, time spent doing physical
      activity, heart rate, and distance. Participant may choose to record the food participant
      eats and mood. Participant's ability to keep wearing the watch will be measured. No
      identifying information will be used on the devices.

      Participant should wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on
      participant's wrist. If it becomes too bothersome, participant can take the watch off and
      put it back on after an hour.

      Participant should regularly clean the band and participant's wrist, especially after
      participant's rehabilitation sessions. Rinse the band with water or wipe it with a small
      amount of rubbing alcohol. Do not use hand soap, body soap, dish soap, hand sanitizers,
      cleaning wipes or household cleaners which could get trapped beneath the band and irritate
      participant's skin. Always dry the band well before putting it back on.

      If any of the devices are lost, stolen, or broken, participant should tell the study staff
      right away. They will be replaced at no cost to participant as long as participant has
      followed the study doctor's instructions. After participant completes the study, we ask that
      participant return the devices to the study staff.

      At the end of the 14-day period, participant will be called by the study staff to remind
      participant to complete the same 2 questionnaires about participant's symptoms and level of
      physical function. Participant will complete another questionnaire about participant's
      experience with the wearable exercise tracker. These questionnaires should take about 15
      minutes total to complete.

      If participant chooses to complete these forms electronically, they will be made available
      online with a link on the iPod. Participant may also choose to complete the questionnaires
      over the phone.

      Participant will be asked to return the wearable tracker and iPod Touch to the research
      coordinator at participant's next routine clinic visit. If participant is unable to return
      to the clinic, participant will be asked to mail back the devices with the FedEx postage
      paid envelope provided to participant when participant started the study.

      Basic information, such as participant's name, date of birth, race, gender, economic
      background, and medical record number will also be collected.

      Length of Study:

      Participation on this study will be over after participant completes the second set of
      questionnaires.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
