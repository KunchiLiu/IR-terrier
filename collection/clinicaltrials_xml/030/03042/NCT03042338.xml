      Feasibility study of Central Executive Training (CET) for ADHD. The goal of the current
      project is to develop and assess the feasibility, acceptability, engagement, and usability
      of a novel, central executive (CE) working memory training intervention.

      The goal of the core study is to develop a central executive training (CET) intervention for
      children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and examine its feasibility,
      acceptability, engagement, and usability. This will involve early developmental work on
      software and treatment manuals followed by evaluation of the feasibility of enrolling,
      retaining, and treating ADHD children with CET. An evidence-informed intervention targeting
      central executive functioning in children with ADHD has the potential to result in
      clinically significant improvements in ADHD symptoms relative to extant behavioral
      treatments and capacity-based (short-term memory) training interventions. The long-term goal
      is to develop an efficacious and acceptable CET intervention with the potential for
      generalized improvements in, or normalization of, ADHD-related impairments in peer, family,
      and academic functioning.
