      Task-specific focal dystonias are characterized by selective activation of dystonic
      movements during performance of highly learned motor tasks, such as writing or playing a
      musical instrument. To date, there is only limited knowledge about the distinct neural
      abnormalities that lead to the development of task-specificity in focal dystonias, which
      affect similar muscle groups but result in different clinical manifestations, such as
      writer's cramp vs. pianist's dystonia or spasmodic dysphonia vs. singer's dystonia. Our goal
      is to dissect the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of task
      specificity in isolated focal dystonias using multi-level brain network analysis in
      conjunction with neuropathological examination of postmortem brain tissue from patients with
      dystonia. Rather than viewing these disorders as interesting curiosities, understanding the
      biology of task-specific activation of motor programs is central to understanding dystonia.

      Task-specific primary focal dystonias (tsPFDs) are characterized by selective activation of
      dystonic movements during performance of highly learned motor tasks, such as writing,
      playing a musical instrument, speaking, or singing. Despite the recent advances in
      describing the clinical features of dystonia, there is a fundamental gap in understanding
      the neural abnormalities underlying the development of tsPFDs, which affect the same muscles
      but result in different clinical manifestations as in writer's cramp vs. pianist's dystonia
      or spasmodic dysphonia vs. singer's dystonia. Continued existence of this gap is an
      important problem because it renders us unable to differentiate between primary and
      secondary brain changes contributing to the tsPFD pathophysiology and to develop novel
      treatment options targeting disorder-specific brain alterations. The objective of this
      application is to identify the brain mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of task
      specificity in two representative groups of patients with writer's cramp vs. musician's hand
      dystonia and spasmodic dysphonia vs. singer's laryngeal dystonia using a novel approach of
      combined clinico-behavioral examination, brain network analysis and quantitative
      neuropathology of postmortem brain tissue. Our central hypothesis is that each tsPFD is
      characterized by distinct brain abnormalities, which selectively affect the focal segments
      of brain networks responsible for the performance of the respective motor task. The
      rationale for the proposed research is that identification of tsPFD-specific brain changes
      and associated neuropathology will clarify the neural mechanisms (primary vs. secondary)
      contributing to the clinical manifestation of these disorders and thus explain the
      phenomenon of task-specificity in PFDs. The obtained results are expected to provide strong
      scientific bases for the next series of studies directed towards identification and
      validation of novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. The
      researchers will pursue the following two specific aims: (1) determine distinct features of
      brain functional network abnormalities underlying task-specificity in different tsPFDs, and
      (2) establish structural correlates of functional neuroimaging abnormalities in tsPFDs. The
      proposed research is significant because it is expected to establish scientific evidence
      that tsPFD is a network disorder with abnormalities following distinct patterns in different
      tsPFDs and certain abnormalities showing structure-function correlations are associated with
      underlying neuropathology. By converging the results from multimodal cross-disciplinary
      studies to a coherent and pathophysiologically meaningful picture, the researchers will be
      well positioned to identify primary vs. secondary changes in tsPFDs and establish a
      scientific framework for the development of diagnostic biomarkers and novel treatment
      options for these disorders.

        Patients with writer's cramp, musician's focal hand dystonia, spasmodic dysphonia,

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will have clinically documented focal dystonia (including spasmodic
             dysphonia, singer's dystonia, writer's cramp, musician's focal hand dystonia)

          -  Healthy controls will be healthy volunteers with a negative history of neurological,
             laryngeal or psychiatric problems

          -  Age from 21 to 80 years.

          -  Native English speakers.

          -  Right-handedness (based on Edinburgh Handedness Inventory).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are incapable of giving an informed consent.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women until a time when they are no longer pregnant or
             breastfeeding. All women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test
             performed, which must be negative for participation in the imaging studies.

          -  Subjects with past or present medical history of (a) neurological problems, such as
             stroke, movement disorders (other than dystonia in the patient groups), brain tumors,
             traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness, ataxias, myopathies, myasthenia
             gravis, demyelinating diseases, alcoholism, drug depend-ence; (b) psychiatric
             problems, such as schizophrenia, major and/or bipolar depression,
             obsessive-compulsive disorder; (c) laryngeal problems, such as vocal fold paralysis,
             paresis, vocal fold nodules and polyps, carcinoma, chronic laryngitis.

          -  Patients who are not symptomatic due to treatment with botulinum toxin injections
             into the laryngeal muscles. The duration of positive effects of botulinum toxin vary
             from patient to patient but lasts on average for 3-4 months. All patients will be
             evaluated to ensure that they are fully symptomatic prior to entering the study.

          -  Patients with other forms of dystonia.

          -  Patients with hereditary forms of dystonia (e.g., DYT1, DYT6, GNAL). If ARSG gene is
             identified in MD and LD patients, it will be used as a nuisance covariate in imaging
             analysis.

          -  Patients who have dystonia symptoms at rest in order to avoid the potential confound
             of dystonic spasms occurring during the scanning.

          -  To avoid the possibility of confounding effects of drugs acting upon the central
             nervous system, all study participants will be questioned about any prescribed or
             over-the-counter medications as part of their initial intake screening. Those
             patients who receive medication(s) affecting the central nervous system will be
             excluded from the study.

          -  The patients will be asked whether they have undergone any head, neck, or hand
             surgeries, which resulted in changes in regional anatomy or innervation. Because
             brain, hand and laryngeal surgery may potentially lead to the brain structure and
             function re-organization, all patients with history of brain, hand and/or laryngeal
             surgery will be excluded from the study.

          -  Subjects who have tattoos, ferromagnetic objects in their bodies (e.g., implanted
             stimulators, surgical clips, prosthesis, artificial heart valve, etc.) that cannot be
             removed for the purpose of study participation.
