      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bio-equivalence of a single oral administration
      of TAK-536 pediatric formulation (granules) in comparison with a TAK-536 commercial
      formulation in Japanese healthy adult male participants in an open label, 2-period,
      2-treatment, cross-over design.

          3. The participant is a Japanese healthy adult male.

          4. The participant is aged 20 to 35 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent.

          5. The participant weighs at least 50.0 kg, and has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5
             and 25.0 kg/m^2, inclusive, at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The participant has suspected hypotension with associated physical findings, such as
             dizziness postural, facial pallor, or cold sweats based on evaluation/physical
             examination at Screening, on the day before the study drug administration (Day -1) in
             Period 1, or up to the study drug administration on the Period 1.

          2. The participant has received any study drug within 16 weeks (112 days) prior to the
             study drug administration in Period 1.

          3. The participant has received TAK-536 or TAK-491 in a previous clinical study or as a
             therapeutic agent.

         14. The participant has undergone whole blood collection of at least 800 mL in total
             within 52 weeks (364 days) prior to the start of the study drug administration in
             Period 1.

         15. The participant has undergone blood component collection within 2 weeks (14 days)
             prior to the start of the study drug administration in Period 1.

         16. The participant has an abnormal (clinically significant) ECG at Screening or prior to
             the study drug administration in Period 1.

         17. The participant has abnormal laboratory values that suggest a clinically significant
             underlying disease, or participant with the following laboratory abnormalities at
             Screening or prior to the study drug administration in Period 1: alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;1.5×the upper limits
             of normal (ULN).
