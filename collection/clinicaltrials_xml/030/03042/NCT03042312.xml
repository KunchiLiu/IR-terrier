      Studies will assess safety and efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer.

      Primary goal of this study is evaluation of safety and efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617.

      Safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (Radioligand Therapy) RLT will be assessed by analysis of toxicity.
      Descriptive statistics (number and percentage) will be reported separately for Adverse
      Events (AE) in total and Serious Adverse Events (SAE). These descriptive statistics will be
      presented for the whole treatment as well as separate for each cycle. In addition, the
      relationship of AE to the study drug (related, not related) will be reported. Both results
      from laboratory test, physical examinations and patients surveys will be included.

      Efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 will be reported using descriptive statistics by means of number
      and percentage of patients with ≥50% decline at 12-weeks from baseline.

    <time_frame>48 months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with PSA decline after start of treatment , PSA progression is defined as time from baseline to time the PSA increases to 25% and 2 ng/ml above nadir which is confirmed by a second value ≥3 weeks later For patients without PSA decline, PSA progression is defined, as time from baseline to time the PSA increases to 25% and 2 ng/ml above baseline which is confirmed by a second value ≥3 weeks later.
Data will be given separately for the both treatment groups (6.0 vs. 7.4 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-617) and a statistical significant difference will be tested.</description>

    <description>Lutetium (177Lu) -DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid )-PSMA has three components: PSMA is the targeting vector , DOTA (1, 4, 7, 10-tetraazacyclododecane-1, 4, 7, 10-tetraacetic acid) is a radiometal chelator and a linking group, and 177Lu is the beta emitter that upon internalization delivers radiation to the nucleus of tumor cells to cause DNA damage [43] [44, 45]. The targeting vector utilizes glu-urea-lys sequence which is an inhibitor capable of binding to the domain of PSMA. These components have been previously used in human subjects and in medical research.</description>
