      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the long-term outcomes including liver related morbidity, mortality and
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development as compared to those of historical control with
      interferon(IFN)-based treatment.

      Secondary Objective:

        1. To access liver fibrosis progression/regression in CHC patients after sofosbuvir-based
           treatment.

        2. To investigate the long-term outcomes of extrahepatic manifestations of the
           sofosbuvir-based treated cohort as compared to their pretreatment status.

      Primary Endpoint:

      To evaluate the long-term event-free effect after sofosbuvir-based therapy, in terms of free
      of major liver events (including HCC, decompensation with ascites, variceal bleeding,
      hepatic encephalopathy, and liver-related mortality) in CHC patients.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        1. To evaluate hepatic fibrosis progression or regression in CHC patients after
           sofosbuvir-based therapy.

        2. To evaluate the durability of sustained viral response (SVR) in patients achieving SVR
           after sofosbuvir-based therapy.

        3. To evaluate long-term effect of sofosbuvir-based therapy on the extra-hepatic
           manifestations of the cohort. The items include mixed cryoglobulinemia, chronic kidney
           diseases, insulin resistance, diabetic status, cardiovascular events and dyslipidemia.

        4. To evaluate long-term effect of sofosbuvir-based therapy on quality of life on the
           cohort.

      Study Design Prospective, longitudinal observational study

      Study procedure A total of 200 patients receiving sofosbuvir based direct antiviral agents
      (DAAs) in the parent studies will be included for following up to 5 years. Their
      serological, image study and disease status description will be prospectively documented to
      present the long term effects of sofosbuvir-based therapy.

      The presentation of illness will be specified as:

        1. Main hepatic complications as liver fibrosis, hepatic malignancy, liver decompensation
           with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and variceal bleeding, and liver-related
           mortality.

        2. Life quality, extrahepatic symptoms as cryoglobulinemia, diabetes mellitus, insulin
           resistance, lipid profiles, renal insufficiency and other non-liver morbidities and
           malignancy.
