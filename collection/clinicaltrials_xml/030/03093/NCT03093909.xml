      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      gemcitabine that can be given by inhalation (breathing it as a mist) to patients with solid
      tumors that have spread to the lungs from other parts of the body.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If found to be eligible to take part in this study, participants will be assigned to a dose
      level of gemcitabine based on when participants join this study. Up to 6 dose levels of
      gemcitabine will be tested. Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The
      first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive
      a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects are seen. This will
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of gemcitabine is found.

      Each study cycle is 28 days. Participants will visit the clinic before the start of every
      cycle to receive their doses of the study drug for the next cycle. Participants will be
      provided with a machine called a nebulizer to make the gemcitabine mist. To take the study
      drug, participant will breathe the drug mist through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer.

      Participant will take gemcitabine by mist 2 times each week for 4 weeks (28 days). The study
      staff will tell participant which days to take the study drug. If the doctor thinks it is in
      participant's best interest, participant may continue to receive the study drug for up to 12
      cycles.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue taking the study drug for up to 12 cycles. Participant will no
      longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions. If participant has developed
      a tumor outside of the lungs either before or while participant is on study, and the doctor
      thinks it is in participant's best interest, participant may have a local control procedure
      (such as radiation or surgery), that may help to control the disease while continuing to
      receive the study drug. Participant would sign a separate consent form explaining these
      procedures and their risks.

      Participation on the study will be over after participant's last follow-up phone call.

      Study Visits:

      Within 3 days before Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check participant's
           liver function.

        -  Participant will have PFTs.

        -  Participant will have participant's blood oxygen level measured by pulse oximeter.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 8 of Cycle 1:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check participant's
           liver function.

      Participant will have a CT scan at any time during Cycles 2, 4, and 6, and then every 3
      cycles after that. The study doctor will tell participant when participant will have these
      scans.

      To avoid having to come to the study clinic too often, participant may have all blood draws
      done by participant's personal doctor.

      Participant may be called by the study staff and asked about how participant is doing and
      about any side effects about 1 day after participant's first 2 doses of the study drug, at
      the end of Cycle 1, and 1 time every 3 months after that until participant leaves the study
      or the study ends. These calls should last about 15-20 minutes each time.

      This is an investigational study. Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of pancreatic and lung cancer, and other solid tumors. Its administration by
      inhalation is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed
      to work.

      Up to 44 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) Recommended for Phase 2 dose of aerosol gemcitabine (GCB)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is defined as highest dose level with six patients with at most 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurring during cycle 1. Dose levels will continue to be increased until 1 participant experiences DLT. If only 1 of 3 participants experiences DLT, 3 additional patients will be entered.
Dose escalation conducted via accelerated titration method for first 2 dose levels followed by 3+3 method for remaining dose levels. Cohorts of 1 participant per dose level for first 2 dose levels. If at any time during cycle 1 there is an instance of pulmonary grade 2 toxicity or pulmonary function tests (PFT) decline&gt;10% related to study drug, current dose level expanded to 3 participants &amp; switched to 3+3 design. If neither of these nor any other DLT occur in dose levels 1-2, switch will be to the 3 + 3 design beginning with dose level 3. Three participants will be treated at dose level 3, if still no DLT, 3 more treated at dose level 4.</description>

    <description>Dose limiting toxicities associated with the MTD of aerosol GCB using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria version 4 for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. DLT defined as any of the following events that are at least (possibly, probably or definitely) attributable to aerosol GCB. The observation period for the purposes of dose-escalation will be the first cycle of therapy.
DLT Definition includes:
Any episode of respiratory (bronchospasm, cough and/or dyspnea) grade 2 toxicity.
or &gt; 10% decrease in FEV1 that persists &gt; 3 days after the drug is stopped or recurrent episode of respiratory (bronchospasm, cough and/or dyspnea) grade 2 toxicity.
Any grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity.
Any grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.</description>

             requirements.

          4. Subjects with baseline symptoms of fever and/or cough and/or shortness of breath
             and/or wheezing and/or fatigue grade ≥ 2 (CTCAE v4.0).

          5. Patients receiving other concurrent cancer therapy including chemotherapy,
             immunotherapy, or biologic therapy.
