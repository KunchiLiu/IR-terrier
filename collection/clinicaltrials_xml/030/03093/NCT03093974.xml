    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to investigate if the use of inhaled colistimethate sodium
      administered twice daily for 12 months delays the time to the first pulmonary exacerbation
      compared to placebo in subjects with non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis chronically
      infected with P. aeruginosa

             exacerbation requiring intravenous antibiotics in the 12 months preceding the
             Screening Visit;

          -  had 1 positive sputum culture for P. aeruginosa in the 12 months preceding the
             Screening Visit;

          -  are clinically stable and have not required a change in pulmonary treatment for at
             least 30 days before the Screening Visit;

             predicted;

          -  had a positive sputum culture for P. aeruginosa at the Screening Visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             or myeloproliferative disease, severe cardiovascular disease;

          -  receiving treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA);

          -  massive haemoptysis (greater than or equal to 300 mL or requiring blood transfusion)

          -  predominant lung condition being chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or
             asthma or interstitial lung disease in the opinion of the Investigator;

          -  History of any of the following:

          -  listed for transplantation;

          -  any other significant active illness likely to affect the patient's survival within
             12 months;

          -  receiving long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation for the
             management of respiratory failure;
