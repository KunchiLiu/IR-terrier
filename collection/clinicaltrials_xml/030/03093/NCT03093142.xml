  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded, randomized control trial with a pretest-posttest control and
      interventional groups design. Both the assessor and participants are blinded to all
      assessments and evaluations. All patients with subacute stroke undergo in-patient or
      out-patient rehabilitation are screened initially by a series of screening test. Suitable
      patients are assigned randomly to 3 groups respectively. Group 1 is the combined
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and neurofeedback group. Group 2 is the
      neurofeedback group. Group 3 is the control group with sham neurofeedback training.

      Treatment sessions for all three groups are conducted by the investigators who has training
      in neurofeedback and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCs). The neurofeedback
      protocol will follow the study of Reichert et al., 2016. Electroencephalography signals for
      SensoriMotor Rhythm (SMR) training were recorded at channel Cz, digitized at 256 Hertz (Hz)
      and filtered with a 0.5 Hz high-pass and a 60 Hz low-pass filter. 50 Hz Notch filter will be
      setup to eliminate the background noise. A 5-channel system amplifier (Procomp5, thought
      technology) would be adopted for data recording. The ground electrode was located at the
      right mastoid, the reference at the left mastoid. Each participant performed 10 training
      sessions on different days. Sessions were conducted 3-5 times a week and consisted of 10 min
      of preparation, a 3-min baseline trial in which the participants saw moving bars while
      instructed to relax themselves without trying to control the bars voluntarily, and six 3-min
      feedback runs. In these runs, participants were instructed to increase SMR power while
      reducing artifacts (EMG &amp; EOG). Three bars were presented on a computer screen: the height
      of the bar in the middle reflected real-time SMR power (12-15 Hz, band power), while the
      height of the left bar reflected theta power (4-7 Hz, EEG band power) and the height of the
      right bar beta power (EEG band power between 21 and 35 Hz which indicates movements and
      other high-frequency disturbances). The data recorded in the baseline trial was used to
      calculate individual thresholds for the three bars. The threshold of SMR power was adapted
      automatically after each run on the basis of the previous run (mean). When the SMR band
      power exceeded the predefined threshold, the color of the bar changed from red to green.
      When participant was able to move the SMR bar above its threshold while keeping the artifact
      bars below the thresholds, reward was given by getting points shown at the screen.
      Furthermore, auditory feedback was provided as a reward by means of a midi tone feedback.
      Participants were not given any instruction of how to control the feedback bars but were
      only told to stay mentally focused and physically relaxed. Patients in all three groups will
      receive 30 minutes conventional computer remediation training after neurofeedback in each
      training session. Attention Processing Training III software was adopted for clients
      training. The software had categorized attention according to Sohlberg &amp; Mateer, 1987 and
      divided into sustained attention, selective attention, suppression, working memory and
      alternate attention. The programme consisted of both visual and auditory exercises. The
      investigators will assign the computer remediation exercise to the clients according to the
      participants' abilities.

      The tDCS + neurofeedback group will carry out 30 minutes tDCS simultaneously with computer
      remediation. The tDCS protocol is based on the work of Jo. et al., 2009 with anodal tDCS (2
      milliampere (mA), 30 mins, 30 seconds ramp up and down time) applied over DLPFC which is F3
      or F4 according to 10-20 system. Stimulation (2 mA, 30 minutes) will be delivered by a
      direct current stimulator through a pair of 35 cm2 rubber electrodes enclosed in
      saline-soaked sponges and affixed to the head with rubber bands. The anode will be placed at
      F3 and cathode will be placed at F4.

      The sham neurofeedback group will conduct the sham neurofeedback training. The investigator
      would setup according to study done by Engelbregt et al., 2015. The investigator who
      supervise the client to do the neurofeedback training would not know the condition as
      another investigator would setup the machine before the training. The electrodes of the sham
      objects would be placed in the inactive slot of the recording machine. The machine will be
      covered by the blanket after setup so that the operating investigator will not know whether
      it is sham or experimental condition.
