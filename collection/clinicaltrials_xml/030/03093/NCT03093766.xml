  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find differences between patients who do and do not develop
      ICU-acquired hypernatremia (IAH). Therefore extended sodium and fluid balances will be
      performed. Also a couple of other factors that possibly contribute to the development of IAH
      and/or could give clues about the mechanisms in the development of IAH will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICU-acquired hypernatremia (IAH) is common in critically ill patients, but it's aetiology is
      still not fully understood. Sodium overload and inadequate fluid administration are
      generally considered important factors, but a previous retrospective study did not reveal
      differences in sodium or fluid balances between patients who did and did not develop IAH.
      Because this was retrospective these balances will be prospectively studied in this study to
      be more sure about the importances of these balances in the development of IAH. Previous
      studies indicated that (a lot) more factors contribute to the development of IAH. In this
      study these factors will be investigated, hoping to find differences between patients who do
      and do not develop IAH.
