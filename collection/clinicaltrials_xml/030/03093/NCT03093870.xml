  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol for Varlitinib is developed for the treatment of Biliary Tract Cancer.
      Varlitinib (also known as ASLAN001) is a small-molecule, adenosine triphosphate competitive
      inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases - epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal
      growth factor receptor (HER)2, and HER4. Varlitinib may be beneficial to subjects with
      cancer by simultaneous inhibition of these receptors. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the safety and efficacy of Varlitinib in combination with capecitabine for the
      treatment of Biliary Tract Cancer. Treatment groups are Varlitinib+capecitabine and Placebo
      + capecitabine
