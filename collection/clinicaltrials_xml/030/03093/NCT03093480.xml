  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Tolerization With rFVIIIFc</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerization is defined as inhibitor titer less than (&lt;) 0.6 Bethesda units per milliliter (BU/mL).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ITI Success will be defined as negative titer for inhibitor less than (&lt;) 0.6 BU/mL by the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experience Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of Participants with ITI success who reaches the criteria for relapse (defined as inhibitor titer &gt; 0.6 BU/mL or abnormal recovery after tolerance is achieved) will be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Bleeding Episodes During ITI and During the 48-week Period After Successful ITI performed with rFVIIIFc</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>A bleeding episode started from the first sign of a bleed and ended no more than 72 hours after the last treatment for the bleed, within which any symptoms of bleeding at the same location or injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart were considered the same bleeding episode.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Days Away From Work or School</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days missed from school or work will be summarized descriptively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Hospitalization Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Number of hospitalization days will be summarized descriptively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to Treatment Regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as percentage of administered doses versus planned doses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consumption of rFVIIIFc</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>Consumption will be assessed based on amount of administered study treatment.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive rFVIIIFc at a dose of 200 international units (IU)/kilogram (kg) as once daily injections or divided on several injections per day at the discretion of the Investigator, starting at baseline visit up to maximum of 48 Weeks in ITI Period. Participants who meet the criteria for immune tolerance induction (ITI) success will enter the tapering period and will receive rFVIIIFc at a dose adjusted according to Investigator judgement (50 or 100 IU/kg) once a day from Week 1 to 6 and every other day thereafter through Week 16.</description>
