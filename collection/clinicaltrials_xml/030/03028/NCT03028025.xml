    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the performance of StatSeal Advanced
      used in conjunction with the TR Band (SSA) as compared to the TR Band without SSA (TRB)
      relative to: the incidence of peri-procedural radial artery occlusion (RAO) at discharge or
      24 hours, whichever occurs first, and the Time to Hemostasis (TTH).

      This study is a physician initiated, prospective, observational, two arm, randomized study
      to be performed at up to four experienced 'Radial First' centers (UCSD, UCLA. Arkansas Heart
      Hospital and LBVA). A maximum of 180 patients having undergone successful radial
      catheterization will be enrolled in the study, 60 in each arm. 60 patients will be enrolled
      at the LBVA. Enrollment will continue at each site on discretion of the investigators until
      each center enrolls a minimum of 30 patients, or a maximum of 180 patients are enrolled.
      Clinicians will perform the catheterization in accordance with local standard practice, with
      a minimum of 5,000 units of unfractionated heparin for anticoagulation. At the start of the
      TRA procedure, prior to radial artery cannulation, a baseline Pleth-ox exam will be
      performed for all patients and recorded on the CRF. Ulnar compression will be applied to
      confirm that the radial artery is patent. Patients with a type D pattern exam will be
      excluded from the study. At the conclusion of a successful transradial procedure, the
      patient will be randomized to either SSA or TRB, each device applied per protocol &amp; IFU. It
      is hypothesized that if radial artery compression time can be shortened to 40 minutes or
      less, the following could result: improved catheterization lab efficiency, greater patient
      satisfaction and lower complication rates, including RAO, may be improved.

    <description>In order to minimize the occurrence of RAO, Pancholy introduced the &quot;patent&quot; non-occlusive hemostasis technique, designed to address the pressure side of the RAO equation. With this technique, a Hemostasis band is placed and a pulse oximeter is attached to the ipsilateral thumb. Then, while the sheath is being removed, the balloon is fully inflated with approximately 15-18 cc of air to completely occlude the radial artery. Subsequently, the device is slowly deflated while occlusive manual pressure is applied to the ulnar artery located at the Guyon's canal, lateral to the pisiform bone. Patent hemostasis is achieved when oximetry becomes positive and a plethysmographic waveform can be visualized. This technique assures the presence of antegrade flow in the radial artery during hemostasis.</description>

    <description>Despite Pancholy's technique, meticulous patent hemostasis with careful ascertainment of adequacy of the antegrade radial flow to the hand is performed in less than 50% of cases and about a third of transradial operators are unaware of the RAO rates in their own practices. Even when those methods, which are recognized as being labor intensive, result in an appropriate pressure being applied, hemostasis bands are typically left in place for 4 hours or more in patients having undergone PCI, due to the effects of anticoagulation and the risk therein of hematoma at the access site. The use of StatSeal in conjunction with commercially available hemostasis bands has demonstrated the potential to significantly shorten the time required to achieve hemostasis. Further, these results demonstrated the ability to achieve hemostasis using StatSeal with similar, or fewer complications when compared to standard methods, and did so regardless of the patient's anticoagulation status.</description>

    <description>Patients randomly assigned to the experimental group will have a Statseal Advance (SSA) disc applied after withdrawing the radial sheath 2-4 cm. A Tegaderm dressing will be applied to secure the disc position. The TR band will be applied over the SSA disc with the center of the balloon (the green dot) over the center of the SSA disc. The TR band will be inflated with 8cc of air (which is typically occlusive pressure), and the sheath removed. No deflation will occur immediately. After 20 minutes of pressure, 3 cc of air will be removed from the TR band. After an additional 20 minutes (40 minutes after procedure), the TR band will be completely deflated, and the TR band left in place. After an additional 20 minutes (60 minutes after procedure) the TR band will be removed.</description>

    <description>Patients randomly assigned to the control group will have a TR band applied over the arteriotomy site and inflated with 15-18ml of air. After aspirating and clearing the contents of the sheath, the radial sheath will be removed. The TR band will be deflated until bleeding occurs, and 2 ml of air will be reintroduced to provide hemostasis. Patent hemostasis will be documented with plethysmography and oximetry as described below within 5 minutes after band application and removal, and within 30 min of discharge or after 24 hours. The TR band will be left inflated and in place for 2 hours following the procedure for all patients (regardless of diagnostic or PCI procedure), after which deflation attempts will commence.</description>
