  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving SIR-Spheres
      treatment to patients with liver cancer in the same session rather than over 2 sessions,
      which is the standard of care.

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, they will have standard-of-care tests and
      procedures as a part of the planning for SIR-Spheres treatment. The SIR-Spheres treatment
      delivers radiation directly to the liver by a catheter placed in an artery in the groin. A
      catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large artery while
      participant is under local anesthesia and are mildly sedated. Participant's doctor will
      explain this procedure to them in more detail.

      If participant is one of the first 2 participants enrolled in this study, they will have
      their treatment over 2 sessions within 2-4 weeks, which is the standard of care. During
      participant's first session, an extra 10 minutes will be added to their standard imaging for
      research purposes. Each visit should take about 6 hours to complete. Participant will have
      about 2 hours of standard of care tests and imaging and will be asked to stay in the
      hospital for 1-2 hours after the procedure to recover from the anesthesia. The procedure
      itself should take about 2 1/2 hours to complete.

      If participant enrolls after the first 2 participants, they will have their treatment in 1
      session. The visit should take about 8 hours to complete. During this visit, participant
      will have about 5 hours of standard of care tests and imaging. Participant will be asked to
      remain in the hospital for 1-2 hours after the procedure to recover from the anesthesia. The
      procedure itself should take about 2½ to 3½ hours to complete.

      Participant will sign separate consents for the tests, procedures, and SIR-Spheres treatment
      that further explains the procedures and risks. The standard of care tests will include
      blood draws for routine testing.

      Follow-Up:

      Participant will be called by the study staff 1 month after their SIR-Spheres treatment to
      ask how they are doing and if they are having any side effects. The phone call should last
      about 10 minutes.

      At about 3 months and 6 months after the treatment, participant will return to the clinic
      for a physical exam. Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Length of Study:

      Participant will be off study after the follow-up visits.

      This is an investigational study. The SIR-Spheres is delivered using FDA approved and
      commercially available methods. It is investigational to learn if the procedure can be
      safely performed in a single session.

      Up to 12 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
