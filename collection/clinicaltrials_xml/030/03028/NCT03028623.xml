  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of salpingectomy
      versus standard tubal ligation in women undergoing surgical sterilization at the time of a
      planned cesarean delivery. Salpingectomy is currently being investigated as a potential
      strategy for ovarian cancer prevention. While this procedure is currently performed during
      hysterectomies, its feasibility at the time of cesarean delivery is not well established.

      This randomized, prospective clinical trial will compare the two sterilization methods to
      demonstrate that salpingectomy compared with standard tubal ligation at the time of cesarean
      delivery will not result in increased operative time, blood loss or other complications.
      This study is necessary to promote salpingectomy as a standard sterilization method during
      cesarean deliveries.
