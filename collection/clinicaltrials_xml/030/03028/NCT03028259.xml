      A retrospective data review of 243 pregnant women (â‰¤32 wks gestational age), dtat collected
      prior to 5/18/2014, with GDM, or T2DM, and their infants (until discharge from the hospital,
      typically up to 1 week after deliver) will be conducted. These women are of any age and all
      ethnic backgrounds delivering at St. Mary's Health Center.

    <textblock>
      Maternal glucose control is considered to be a major determinant of neonatal outcome in
      pregnancies complicated by diabetes. Studies have examined the link between neonatal
      mortality and morbidity using specific mean preprandial or postprandial plasma glucose
      levels, however, have not taken into account the daily wide excursions that occur in
      maternal glucose levels. Limited data are available on glucose variability (GV) in pregnancy
      and affect on maternal or neonatal outcomes. A recent study amongst diabetics showed that
      glucose variability between two data points, a morning fasting blood glucose and an
      afternoon blood glucose, increased the rate of adverse neonatal outcomes1. Glycosylated
      hemoglobin (A1c), which has been considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diabetes control since
      the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT)2, lacks the specificity to predict
      pregnancy outcomes. Through review of data, we propose to examine other methods of
      evaluating daily maternal glucose variations to determine the correlation to maternal and
      neonatal outcomes.

      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of glucose variability and/ or other
      elements on maternal and neonatal outcomes in the obese diabetic patient. We hypothesize
      that glucose variability will be a stronger indicator of neonatal outcome than A1c or any
      single given blood glucose value. Glucose variability, including the magnitude of
      hyperglycemia or the incidence of acute maternal hypo- or hyperglycemic events, will be
      explored. We hypothesise that obese pregnant women with higher magnitude of glucose
      fluctuations have more maternal and fetal co morbidities.
