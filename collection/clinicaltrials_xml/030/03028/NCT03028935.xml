    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well an evidence-based exercise and
      nutrition program adapted for Latinas will work in improving physical activity and dietary
      behavior in non-active, overweight, or obese rural Latinas. An exercise and nutrition
      program may reduce the risk for developing certain cancers, obesity, and chronic health
      conditions in Latinas who are non-active, overweight, or obese.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Adapt an effective evidence-based exercise and nutrition program to meet the needs of
      rural Latinas.

      II. Implement the adapted program in a rural Latina population. III. Evaluate feasibility
      and potential to improve physical activity and dietary behavior of the adapted program in a
      rural Latina population.

      OUTLINE:

      Phase I: Create a community advisory board to adapt Strong Women Healthy Hearts Program
      (SWHHP) using feedback on the existing SWHHP from Latinas residing in the community.

      Phase II: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      INTERVENTION GROUP: Participants undergo instructor-led exercise and nutrition education
      classes for 60 minutes each twice a week for 12 weeks.

      CONTROL GROUP: Participants are placed on a wait-list and receive no intervention for 12
      weeks and then undergo exercise and nutrition education classes as in Intervention Group.
