  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The STELLARIS study will be conducted to confirm the efficacy and safety of cenicriviroc
      (CVC) for the treatment of liver fibrosis in adult subjects with NASH.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The STELLARIS study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will examine the surrogate endpoint
      of improvement in fibrosis of at least 1 stage (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis clinical
      research network [NASH CRN]) and no worsening of steatohepatitis at Month 12. Subjects from
      Part 1 will continue into Part 2 and additional subjects will be newly randomized in Part 2
      to determine long-term clinical outcomes composed of histopathologic progression to
      cirrhosis, liver-related clinical outcomes, and all-cause mortality.
