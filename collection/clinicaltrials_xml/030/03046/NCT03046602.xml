    <textblock>
      The transfer of newborn child from Intensive Care Unit to maternity is very stressfull for
      parents.This anxiety could have repercussion on parents adaptation on their new environment,
      on parent's role and also on their relaional interaction with the baby. As StJoseph hospital
      receives an important number of premature babies, the neonatology service aim to evaluate
      the real life experience of mothers during the transfer to set up improvement axes with
      hospital departments upstream.
