  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is characterized by the application of an
      electric pulsed current through electrodes positioned on the skin. It can be an alternative
      for pain management after surgery for total hip arthroplasty (THA), since it is a safe and
      cost-effective therapeutic tool, allowing the patient to move early due to pain relief.
      Therefore, the study aims to evaluate the acute effects of TENS associated with standard
      physical therapy compared with standard physical therapy on the intensity of pain, hip range
      of motion and morphine consumption in the rehabilitation of patients after THA.

      The study included patients who underwent THA surgery in the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto
      Alegre (HCPA) and met the study eligibility criteria. The sample was randomly divided into
      experimental group, which received conventional physical therapy associated with the
      application of TENS, and control group, which held only conventional physical therapy, both
      on the first day after the surgery. The pain level, the range of motion of the operated hip
      and the administration of morphine. The experimental group received TENS application held by
      four self-adhesive electrodes size 5x9cm positioned about five centimeters from the edges of
      the surgical scar. TENS was applied in conventional mode, emitting a pulsed biphasic,
      symmetrical rectangular wave with frequency of 100 Hz and pulse duration of 100 µs, for 30
      minutes. The intensity was set according to the tolerance of the patient and was gradually
      increased during the application. The device used was the Neurodyn II model, by IBRAMED.
      Subsequently, the conventional physical therapy was performed. The patients realized active
      exercises of plantar flexion and dorsal flexion of the ankles, flexion and extension of the
      knees and adduction and abduction of the hips, in both lower limbs. All exercises were
      performed with the patient in the supine position in the bed, in one serie of 10
      repetitions. Control group received only conventional therapy consisting of the exercises in
      both lower limbs, identical to those performed in the experimental group.
