  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate AVP-786 for the
      treatment of neurobehavioral disinhibition including aggression, agitation, and irritability
      in participants with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants for this study must have a diagnosis of neurobehavioral disinhibition
      including aggression, agitation, and irritability that persists after brain injury.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study, consisting of up to 12 weeks of
      treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in the Composite of the Clinical Impression Severity Scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Clinician Rating Scale (NPI-C) Subscales of Aggression, Agitation, and Irritability/Lability (NPI-C-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI-C can be used to rate the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms across 14 domains. The scores for each item within an individual domain/subscale range from 0 to 3, with a higher score indicating increased severity. The NPI-C-3 is comprised of the aggression, agitation, and irritability/lability subscales. The scores for the three subscales are summed to create the total NPI-C-3 composite score, which ranges from 0 to 99, with a higher score indicating increased severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Modified Clinical Global Impression of Change (mCGI-C) Raw Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The mCGI-C will be used to assess the clinician's view of the participant's treatment response. The mCGI-C is a 7-point (1 to 7) modified version of the CGI-C scale. A higher score represents worsening of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in NPI-C Rating Scale Subscales Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI-C is used to rate the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms across 14 domains. The clinician will first interview the participant/caregiver to assign a severity rating for each item within an individual domain/subscale; the scores for each item (ranging from 0 to 3, with a higher score indicating increased severity) are then summed to create a total domain score (ranging from 0 to 48). In all cases, a higher score indicates increased severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Frontal Systems Behavior (FrSBe) Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FrSBe is a 46-item questionnaire that was designed to assess frontal behavioral syndromes. It provides total scores and scores for three subscales that rate changes noted in everyday behaviors. Each item in each domain is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The score of each item is summed to create the subscale score, and each subscale score is summed to create the total score (ranging from 46 to 160). In all cases, a higher score represents worsening symptoms/behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Modified Clinical Global Impression of Severity (mCGI-S) Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The mCGI-S will be used to assess the clinician's view of the participant's severity of aggression, agitation, and irritability symptoms. The mCGI-S is a 7-point (1 to 7) modified version of the CGI-S scale. In all cases, a higher score represents increased severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for the evaluation of depression symptoms. Each of the 9 items is scored on a scale from 0 to 3. The total score ranges from 0 to 27. A higher score represents increased severity of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ZBI is a 22-item scale used to assess the impact of the participant's disabilities on the caregiver's life. For each item on the scale, the caregiver has to indicate how often they felt distressed. The score ranges from 0 to 88. A higher score indicates greater caregiver distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Dimension Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic questionnaire measuring the health-related quality of life for 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated on 1 of 5 levels. A higher score indicates worse quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life. It consists of a VAS measuring self-reported health status. The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a VAS with a score of 0 to 100. A higher score represents worse health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) Assessed using a VAS (PGI-S VAS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-S VAS is a single-question VAS that assesses the severity of aggression, agitation, and irritability, on a scale of 0 to 10. A higher score represents increased severity of these symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) Raw Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-C is a 7-point (1 to 7) scale used to assess the participant's assessment of treatment response. A higher score indicates worsening of the symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Post-traumatic Headache (PTH) Assessment Questionnaire Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PTH assessment questionnaire consists of 7 questions that characterize headache frequency, severity, intensity, and the impact of headache on activities. The PTH assessment includes a VAS to rate pain from 0 to 10. A higher score on the VAS represents worse pain.</description>
