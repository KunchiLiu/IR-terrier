  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study in which we will aim to demonstrate successful execution of the
      imaging protocol and to make observations regarding the calcification activity as measured
      by 18F-NaF PET/CT and any correlation to 1) valve age and valve type, and 2) subsequent
      degeneration of aortic valve bioprostheses based upon clinical, echocardiographic and CT
      parameters.

      Additionally, the data will serve as preliminary data to plan a larger study to investigate
      study objectives.

      This five-year pilot study will aim to demonstrate successful execution of the imaging
      protocol and to make observations regarding the calcification activity as measured by
      18F-NaF PET/CT and any correlation to 1) valve age and valve type, and 2) subsequent
      degeneration of aortic valve bioprostheses based upon clinical, echocardiographic and CT
      parameters. Techniques that can identify specific increases in calcification activity are
      therefore likely to provide important insights into predicting the longevity of TAVR valves
      and guidance towards subsequent interventions.

      Twenty patients whom have undergone either TAVR or surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve
      replacement will be invited to participate in an 18F-NaF PET scan (baseline) and CT scan
      imaging (baseline and Year 2). Baseline, Year 1 and 2 will also include clinical assessment,
      labs and echocardiograms. Telephone contact at Years 3, 4, and 5 will provide follow up for
      major cardiovascular adverse events.

    <description>At baseline all subjects will undergo dual cardiac and respiratory-gated PET-CT imaging of the heart and aortic valve. A target dose of 125 MBq 18F-NaF will be administered intravenously. 125ml of iodine-based contrast agent (iohexol [Omnipaque™]) will be given for the CT. Nitroglycerin will be given to increase the size of the coronary arteries and a possible dose of metoprolol may be given to control target heart rate.
Repeat contrast-enhanced CT of the heart and aortic valve will be conducted at Year 2 to investigate to investigate whether 18F-NaF activity predicts progression of calcification in prosthetic valves.</description>
