    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial compares nephrectomy (surgery to remove a kidney or part of
      a kidney) with or without nivolumab in treating patients with kidney cancer that is limited
      to a certain part of the body (localized). Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab before
      nephrectomy may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to
      be removed, and after nephrectomy to increase survival. It is not yet known whether
      nivolumab and nephrectomy is more effective than nephrectomy alone in treating patients with
      kidney cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients with locally advanced renal
      cell carcinoma randomly assigned to perioperative nivolumab in conjunction with radical or
      partial nephrectomy with patients randomized to surgery alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate for differences in recurrence-free survival associated with perioperative
      nivolumab compared to surgery alone among the subset of patients with clear cell histology.

      II. To compare the overall survival between patients randomized to perioperative nivolumab
      in addition to resection to patients randomized to primary tumor resection alone.

      III. To describe the safety and tolerability of perioperative nivolumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the primary tumor's expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      with outcome.

      II. To correlate the expression of PD-L1 on tumor tissue at recurrence with outcome.

      III. To archive images for central confirmation of recurrence and for future correlative
      work with American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN), including markers
      predicting outcome or response.

      IV. To prospectively collect tumor and biologic specimens (e.g., serum, peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) for future correlative studies.

      V. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab and explore exposure response
      relationships with respect to safety and efficacy.

      VI. To characterize the immunogenicity of nivolumab. VII. To evaluate differences in change
      from baseline in patient-reported symptoms and toxicities among patients randomized to
      treatment with nivolumab compared to surgery alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 14 days for 2 courses. Patients then undergo partial or radical nephrectomy.
      Patient then receive nivolumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses,
      and then every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients undergo partial or radical nephrectomy followed by observation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and every 12 months for 5 years.
