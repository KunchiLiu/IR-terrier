  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-site, double-blind
      trial of MK-8189 compared with placebo, using Risperidone as an active control. The
      participants will be adult subjects experiencing an acute episode of schizophrenia,
      according to the criteria specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5). This study will be up to 7 weeks in duration, with up to 7 site
      visits for each participant. The study will consist of a Screening/tapering period (up to
      one week long), a 4-week treatment period, and a 14-day follow-up period. The primary
      objective will be to assess symptoms of schizophrenia at 4 weeks, and to assess safety and
      tolerability during treatment and post-treatment follow-up. The secondary objective will be
      to assess the severity of schizophrenia at 4 weeks. The primary hypothesis is that MK-8189
      is superior to placebo in reducing the overall symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the
      mean change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score
      after 4 weeks of treatment.

    <description>Participants will receive double-blind MK-8189 4 mg controlled release (CR) tablet(s) once daily (QD) over 4 weeks. In a 3-step dose escalation regimen over 1 week, participants will receive MK-8189 at the following dose strengths: 4 mg (1 tablet) QD, 8 mg (2 tablets) QD, and 12 mg (3 tablets) QD. Participants will achieve the final dose of 12 mg, as tolerated.</description>

In a 3-step dose escalation regimen over 1 week, participants will receive Risperidone at the following dose strengths: 2 mg (1 capsule) QD, 4 mg (2 capsules) QD, and 6 mg (3 capsules) QD.

Participants will receive matching double-blind placebo over 1 week in mock dose escalation consistent with that of the MK-8189 and Risperidone doses.</description>
