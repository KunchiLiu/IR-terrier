  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The product under investigation is an investigational combination of two marketed products
      in a low dose. Utilizing previously unrecognized properties of the components, the
      components of the combination inhibits two distinct targets in a newly discovered molecular
      pathway resulting in reduction of neuro-inflammation induced pain. The investigators propose
      that migraine is caused by innate immune system-induced neuro-inflammation near the
      trigeminal nerve system.

      The use of this combination product holds a strong biological rationale, acting
      synergistically, the two component contribute to blocking of two distinct neuro-inflammation
      producing targets.

      The goal of this study is to establish that the investigational product addresses not only
      headache pain but also other migraine associated symptoms, especially, nausea. Nausea
      associated with acute Migraine represents a significant unmet treatment need. Significant
      efficacy for headache pain and for nausea may suggest that the product's mechanism of action
      addresses the fundamental pathogenesis of migraine.

      The study consists of a screening visit, at home treatment of a single migraine attack with
      a single dose of the study drug, after study eligibility is confirmed, and an End-of-Study
      Visit 2-4 days after treatment of a migraine attack. Patients will have up to 8-week to
      treat a Qualified Migraine attack . The duration of patients' participation in the study is
      up to 10 weeks.

             for at least one-year.

          3. The patient has 2 - 8 migraines per month in each of the previous 3 months.

          4. The patient had the first migraine prior to age 50 years.

          5. The patient agrees not to take any medication to treat acute migraine within 24 hours
             before taking the study drug.

          6. The patient agrees to refrain from taking opiate medications from randomization to 7
             days after taking the study drug.

          7. The patient agrees to refrain from taking other medications to treat the migraine for
             2 hours after taking the study drug.

          8. The patient is able to complete study questionnaires, comply with the study

             effects during 3 months before inclusion into the trial (E.g., calcium channel
             blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, selective serotonin re-uptake
             inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs)).

             impairment, heart disease, etc.

         10. The patient has a history within the previous 3 years of abuse of any drug,
             prescription, illicit, or alcohol.

         12. The Male patient is not practicing 2 different methods of birth control with their
             partner during the study, and for 28 days after the investigational drug last dose or
             will not remain abstinent during the study, and for 28 days after the last dose.

         13. The patient has known-hypersensitivity reaction to any of the components of the
             investigational drug.

         14. The patient has participated in another study with an investigational drug within 30
             days prior to randomization and/or plan to participate during the study.
