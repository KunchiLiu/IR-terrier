    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, open-label, 2-arm, Phase 3 study is to assess the assess the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of rovalpituzumab tesirine versus topotecan in
      participants with advanced or metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) with high levels of
      delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) and who have first disease progression during or following
      front-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
