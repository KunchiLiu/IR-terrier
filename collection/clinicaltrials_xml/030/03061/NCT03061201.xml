  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and time-course profile of
      FVIII activity levels with adaptive doses of SB-525.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to reduce or eliminate the need for FVIII replacement therapy.
      The proposed SB-525 clinical study uses a recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/6 (AAV2/6)
      vector encoding the cDNA for the B-domain deleted human F8 (hF8). The secreted FVIII has the
      same amino acid sequence as approved recombinant anti hemophilic factors (Refacto® and
      Xyntha®). The SB-525 vector encodes a liver-specific promotor module and AAV2/6 exhibits
      liver tropism, thus providing the potential for long-term hepatic production of FVIII in
      hemophilia A subjects.

      The constant production of FVIII after a single SB-525 administration may provide potential
      benefit in durable protection against bleeding and the complications thereof without
      lifelong repetitive IV factor replacement administration.
