  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether ubiquinol is well tolerated, can affect the
      symptoms of Parkinson's Disease and change the energy levels in the brain. Subjects will be
      randomized to taking ubiquinol or placebo and will have a neurological evaluation, magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and blood test for biological markers taken during the study.

    <textblock>
      Multiple lines of evidence have implicated abnormal energy metabolism and deficient
      mitochondrial function in Parkinson's disease, presenting a unique target for therapy. A
      pilot study of ubiquinol in PD was therefore undertaken to determine its effects upon
      physiologic measures of mitochondrial metabolic function. The incorporation of a
      neuroimaging biomarker is particularly important, since changes would demonstrate our
      ability to achieve Central Nervous System (CNS) access from this an formulation, accompanied
      by a meaningful neurophysiologic effect. Hydrogen Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
      Imaging (1H MRSI) is a technique that provides insight into the metabolism of several
      endogenous brain compounds, most notably N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), choline-containing
      compounds (Cho), and creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr). A number of studies of mitochondrial
      function have now firmly established the utility of 1H MRSI in probing potential
      mitochondrial energy metabolism dysfunction, in primary mitochondrial disorders, but also in
      PD. This pilot study is therefore designed to test whether oral ubiquinol affects cerebral
      indices of mitochondrial dysfunction, as measured by 1H MRSI in patients with Parkinson's
      disease, and to gather preliminary information on the safety and tolerability of ubiquinol
      in individuals with PD.
