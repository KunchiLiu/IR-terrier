  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients are treated for advanced cancer without knowledge of underlying molecular
      features that might indicate FDA approved therapies or potential eligibility for
      biomarker-selected clinical trials. Strata Oncology is initiating the Strata Trial
      (STR-001-001) with the primary goal of understanding the proportion of subjects available
      for clinical trials and approved targeted therapies in advanced cancer while assessing the
      feasibility of using a large-scale NGS screening program to match subjects for eligibility
      assessments in clinical trials and/or for approved targeted therapies. The Strata Trial does
      not require additional procedures but rather uses surplus, or leftover tumor specimens for
      molecular profiling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Strata Trial is a precision oncology collaboration structured as an observational master
      screening protocol with the aim to match patients to genomically-guided therapeutic
      protocols and/or approved therapies. Subjects enrolled on the Strata trial will submit
      surplus, clinical formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens for molecular
      profiling and a test report will be provided back to the investigator. For those subjects
      identified as having molecular variants associated with an affiliated therapeutic protocol
      and/or approved targeted therapy, the Strata report will provide additional relevant
      information.

      All molecular profiling will be performed in the Strata Oncology CLIA-certified laboratory
      (Ann Arbor, MI). The molecular profiling assays will include targeted next generation
      sequencing (NGS) of DNA and RNA covering a range of actionable genomic variants, such as
      gene mutations (e.g. those in EGFR and BRAF), gene amplifications (e.g. ERBB2) and gene
      fusions (e.g. ALK).

      Subjects who have been identified with genetic alterations relevant to a trial or targeted
      therapy will be followed for treatment changes for three years from the time of signed
      informed consent.
