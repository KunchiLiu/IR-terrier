  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefit and safety of relugolix 40 mg once
      daily co-administered with low dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with
      placebo for 24 weeks on heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids.
      Additionally, this study is designed to evaluate the benefit of relugolix 40 mg once daily
      for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with low
      dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with placebo for 24 weeks in the same
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an international phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy
      and safety study to evaluate 24 weeks of oral daily relugolix 40 mg co-administered with
      low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate (Group A) and 12 weeks of daily oral relugolix
      40 mg alone followed by 12 weeks of daily oral relugolix 40 mg co-administered with low-dose
      estradiol and norethindrone acetate (Group B) compared with 24 weeks of placebo (Group C).

      Approximately 390 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids will
      be enrolled in the study and will participate for approximately 10 months. Participation
      will include an ~ 11 week screening period, 24 weeks of treatment and a follow up period of
      ~ 30 days. A diagnosis of uterine fibroids will be confirmed during the screening period by
      centrally-reviewed transvaginal and/or transabdominal ultrasound.

      Following successful completion of the Screening period study participants will be
      randomized to Treatment Group A, B, or C and will attend visits monthly (ie, every 4 weeks).
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, vital signs,
      physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and
      assessments of bone mineral density.

      All patients completing the Week 24 visit, including women randomized to placebo, will be
      offered the opportunity to enroll in an open-label extension study in which all eligible
      patients will receive relugolix co-administered with low-dose estradiol and norethindrone
      acetate. Patients who do not enroll into the extension study will have a follow-up visit
      approximately 30 days after the end of treatment (ie, after the patient's last dose of study
      medication).
