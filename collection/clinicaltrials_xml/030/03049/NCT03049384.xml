    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a common and distressing symptom in cancer survivors. Cancer-related fatigue is
      relieved with physical activity but the mechanisms for this are not well understood. The
      investigators hypothesize that a tailored and individualized exercise intervention will
      reduce cancer-related fatigue more than a classical exercise intervention. This study is
      designed to investigate the causes of fatigue with whole-body exercise and their relation to
      self-reported measures of fatigue before and after an exercise intervention.

      Background and Rationale

      Approximately one-third of cancer survivors experience severe and persistent fatigue for a
      number of years post-treatment, but this distressing symptom is often under-treated by
      healthcare professionals due to a lack of mechanism-targeted interventions. The assessment
      of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is reliant on subjective fatigue measurements such as
      self-report questionnaires. Less attention has been given to objective physiological
      measurements. However, there are well-established techniques which allow the assessment of
      neuromuscular fatigue and its peripheral and central origins which could be utilized in the
      study of CRF. Very few studies have considered these objective measures alongside
      self-report scales in the study of CRF and only two have used such techniques in cancer
      survivors. To date, no studies have investigated neuromuscular fatigue in whole body,
      dynamic activity as relevant to daily tasks (and involving the lower limb due to its
      functional relevance to locomotion). Novel testing developed in our laboratory could be used
      as part of a wider screening to develop individualized interventions to alleviate CRF. It is
      well accepted in the field that CRF is multidimensional and in addition to a potential
      neuromuscular component, the role of sleep disturbance may also be implicated. Interventions
      targeted at improving sleep quality are therefore warranted, and there is sound evidence for
      the efficacy of exercise interventions in particular for improving CRF in cancer survivors.
      As a non-pharmacological intervention, physical activity has the strongest evidence base for
      treating CRF. However, the mechanisms explaining the reduction of CRF with exercise are not
      understood. Due to the complex and multi-factorial nature of CRF, it would be of benefit to
      tailor exercise interventions to the specific deficits (in regards to neuromuscular
      mechanisms) or difficulties (for example sleep disturbance) experienced by the individual.
      Ultimately, mechanism-targeted exercise interventions could be translated to clinical
      rehabilitation programs and lead to an improved quality of for cancer survivors.

      Research Question &amp; Objectives

      The primary aim of this research is to investigate the effect of a traditional vs. tailored
      12-week exercise intervention on objective measures of neuromuscular fatigue and sleep
      disturbance, and subjective measures of CRF in cancer survivors. Secondary objectives
      include:

        -  To determine the central and peripheral contributions to neuromuscular fatigue with
           whole-body exercise in cancer survivors experiencing persistent CRF;

        -  To evaluate the relationship between objective measures of neuromuscular function with
           subjective self-report measures of CRF in cancer survivors.

        -  To evaluate the relationship between objective measures of sleep disturbance with
           subjective self-report measures of CRF in cancer survivors.

      Methods

      Fatigued cancer survivors who have completed treatment ≥ three months and ≤ five years prior
      to enrollment will be recruited for this study. The study design involves pre-testing, a
      12-week intervention and post-testing. Participants will be required to visit the laboratory
      for two experimental visits before and after the 12-week intervention. Lab visits will
      involve the measurement of subjective (questionnaires) and objective (e.g. neuromuscular and
      sleep) measures of fatigue.

      Participants will be matched for (a) type of cancer; (b) level of fatigue and (c) age.
      Participants will be randomly assigned into one of three treatment groups: classical
      training (CT), tailored training (TT) or a control group. The CT group will undertake a
      supervised exercise intervention involving aerobic exercise and light resistance training.
      The experimental TT group will be prescribed an individualized exercise intervention
      designed specifically to counteract deficits of difficulties identified during pre-testing.
      The program will be established based on the results of the initial testing. Both groups
      will train 3 - 5 times per week.
