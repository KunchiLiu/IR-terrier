  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no clear indication if exercise is safe and if it confers health
      benefits for adults undergoing preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer - a
      population who may have limited exercise tolerance and who may be at an increased risk for
      adverse events associated with exercise. In this prospective single-arm feasibility trial,
      we aim to examine the safety and feasibility of a 12-week exercise intervention for adults
      undergoing preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer to inform the
      development of a large-scale randomized controlled trial that will assess the efficacy of
      exercise administered during preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer.
      Adults diagnosed with rectal cancer and scheduled for preoperative neoadjuvant
      chemoradiation will be recruited over a 12-month period into a supervised exercise
      intervention consisting of aerobic and strength training to be done 3 times per week.
      Feasibility, safety, patient-reported outcomes, and physical tests will be performed
      pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at follow-up (i.e., 6 weeks post-intervention).
      This study will provide data on the feasibility of an exercise intervention and will help
      determine if it is safe to progress with a large-scale randomized controlled trial to test
      the benefits of exercise for adults undergoing preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation for
      rectal cancer. It will also provide initial estimates of the parameters for patient-reported
      outcomes, which are required to calculate the sample size for the large-scale randomized
      controlled trial to ensure it is sufficiently powered.
