  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized (1:1; oral treprostinil to placebo), double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in subjects with World Health Organization (WHO) Group 2 pulmonary
      hypertension (PH) associated with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
      Once randomized, subjects will take the initial dose of study drug at the study site on the
      day of randomization. Subjects will return to the study site for visits scheduled at Weeks
      6, 12, 18, and 24. The treatment phase of the study will last approximately 24 weeks.

    <measure>Time to Clinical Worsening Over the 24-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical worsening is defined as the occurrence of any 1 of the following clinical worsening events: hospitalization due to a cardiopulmonary indication, outpatient administration of intravenous diuretics, death (all causes), decrease in 6MWD &gt;15% from Baseline directly related to disease under study at 2 consecutive visits on different days.</description>

    <measure>Change in N-terminal Pro-brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) Levels from Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The NT-proBNP concentration is a biomarker associated with changes in right heart morphology and function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in WHO Functional Class from Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
