  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurotrophic keratitis (NK) is a degenerative disease of the cornea due to the impairment of
      the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve. Reduced corneal sensation lead to several
      corneal lesions including spontaneous ulcerations, delayed wound healing, corneal scarring,
      neovascularization, thinning, perforation or infection. An important and permanent visual
      loss of is frequently associated with the condition. NK can be congenital or acquired. Its
      acquired forms can be due to traumatic, infectious (herpes, zoster), neoplastic or
      iatrogenic causes. There is currently no specific medical treatment. Surgical reconstruction
      techniques of sensory neurotizations have recently been described in young patients
      suffering traumatic, congenital or neoplastic NK using supratrochlear nerves as the sensory
      donor nerves and sural nerve as healthy graft. A neurotization involves the transfer of a
      healthy donor nerve segment into a tissue to reestablish either motor or sensory
      innervation. The aim of the present study is to assess the outcomes of a novel sensory
      neurotization technique for the treatment of severe NK in adult patients (Stages 2 and 3 of
      Mackie classification). Corneal neurotizations will be performed using either ipsilateral
      supraorbital nerve as donor nerve (direct neurotization) or contralateral supraorbital nerve
      as donor nerve and a segment of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve as graft.
      Small-size skin incisions (less than 3 centimeters) will be made in one or both eyebrow and
      an endoscopic device will help the surgeons to localize and dissect the supraorbital nerve.
      Donor nerves or graft will be sutured to the neurotrophic corneas. Adult patients with
      unilateral NK due to infectious, traumatic or iatrogenic causes will be included.
