    <textblock>
      Phase 1b (Dose Escalation) in primarily CLL/SLL patients will evaluate safety and
      pharmacology of self-administered twice a day oral doses beginning at 25 mg/dose for 4 weeks
      with succeeding cohorts at escalating doses until establishing dose limiting toxicity or,
      recommended Phase 2 dose. Patient data will be assessed before authorizing dose escalation
      cohorts. Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion) will follow in cohorts using the recommended dose to
      explore clinical activity, safety, pharmacology of SNS-062 as monotherapy.

      Phase 1b (Dose Escalation) This portion of the study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacology of a range of SNS-062 dose levels administered to subjects with previously
      treated B-lymphoid malignancies, including: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic
      lymphoma (CLL/SLL), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma/Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (LPL/WM),
      and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

      All subjects will self-administer SNS-062 orally BID. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
      window will be 4 weeks (1 cycle in length). Assessments after the DLT window will be
      performed in 4-week cycles. Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled at
      progressively higher dose levels of SNS-062 using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design.

      Based on the pattern of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in the first cycle (4
      weeks), escalation will proceed to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or a
      recommended dose (RD) that may be the MTD or a lower dose. An additional 6 subjects may be
      accrued at the MTD or the RD to confirm SNS-062 safety and pharmacology as a prelude to
      further clinical evaluation. Assessments regarding DLTs and dose escalation will be
      performed by a SRC comprising, but not limited to, the principal investigators, the medical
      monitor and the study sponsor drug safety representative.

      Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion) This portion of the study provides cohort expansion to further
      explore the clinical activity, safety, and pharmacology of SNS-062 monotherapy. Accrual will
      be by enrollment into each disease and mutation specific cohort. Subjects will
      self-administer SNS-062 orally at the RD of SNS-062 identified in the Phase 1b portion of
      the study. Study personnel will meet regularly to assess the efficacy and safety for each
      cohort.
