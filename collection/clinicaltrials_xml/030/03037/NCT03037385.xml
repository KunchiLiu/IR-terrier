  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antineoplastic
      activity of BLU-667 administered orally in patients with NSCLC, thyroid cancer and other
      solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts, a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and an expansion part (Part
      2). Both parts will enroll patients with advanced NSCLC, advanced thyroid cancer and other
      advanced solid tumors that have progressed following standard systemic therapy, have not
      adequately responded to standard systemic therapy, or in patients who are intolerant to or
      have declined standard therapy.
