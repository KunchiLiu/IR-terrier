  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study will be to compare bite force (BF) measurements over a 12-hour
      period of a currently marketed denture adhesive cream based on carbomer technology (test),
      with a positive control and a negative/no treatment control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, randomized, crossover, 3-treatment, 3-period study to compare
      BF measurements over a 12 hour period of a currently marketed denture adhesive cream based
      on carbomer technology (test), with a positive control, and a negative/no treatment control.
      A short questionnaire regarding the flavor and texture characteristics of each denture
      adhesive after a single use will also be used to generate data for these attributes.

    <measure>Area over baseline over 12 hours (AOB0-12) for the incisal bite force</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Area over baseline over 12 hours (AOB0-12) will be calculated to measure the incisal BF. AOB0-12 is defined as (AUC0-12)/12 minus baseline BF (pounds [lbs]). AUC= Area under the curve. AUC will be calculated using trapezoidal method. Higher values of AOB demonstrate a stronger incisal bit force over time than lower values.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Demonstrates understanding of the study procedures, restrictions and willingness to

          -  Good general and mental health with, in the opinion of the investigator or medically
             qualified designee: No clinically significant and relevant abnormalities in medical
             history or upon oral examination; absence of any condition that could affect the
             participant's safety or wellbeing or their ability to understand and follow study
             procedures and requirements.

          -  Diagnosis: a) Completely edentulous maxillary arch restored with a conventional full
             acrylic based upper complete denture, b) Dentate, partial or full edentulous
             mandibular arch. Partial or full edentulous arch may be restored with a stable
             complete, partial or implant supported denture, c) Maxillary dentures must be
             considered to be moderately well-fitting at the screening visit (Kapur Index, Olshan
             Modification: retention score &gt;2, stability score &gt;2) d) Maxillary dentures and
             mandibular dentures, if present, must be considered to be well-made based on design
             and construction criteria specified in the protocol e) The qualifying maxillary
             incisal BF readings (without adhesive) must be less than or equal to 9 pounds at the
             Screening Visit and subsequent visit pretreatment baseline bites. f) At least 2 of
             the 4 qualifying bite readings at the Screening Visit must be reproducible (+2lb). At
             subsequent visits the bite force readings must be within +2lb for 1 of the 3 practice
             bites and the pre-treatment baseline bite.
