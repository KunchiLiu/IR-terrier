    <textblock>
      Anxiety prior to surgery is an expected emotion. Research has not been conducted on methods
      to reduce anxiety in the operating room itself. STERIS Corporation has developed an
      automated surgical suite environmental system, called SignatureSuite™, that controls the
      level of lighting, images on OR monitors, and ambient background audio via preset,
      computerized automation for use before and after anesthesia. This study aims to determine if
      this new type of operating room environment decreases anxiety, as measured by patient
      reports, vital signs, and postoperative analgesic use. The proposed study will be a mixed
      method, two-arm, randomized controlled trial comparing anxiety levels for patients that have
      thyroid or parathyroid surgery in the SignatureSuite room at Cleveland Clinic Marymount
      Hospital versus the standard operating room environment. Randomization will occur at the
      surgeon level. There will be a maximum 100 patients divided equally between the experimental
      and control arms of the study. Staff perceptions of the room will also be assessed at the
      conclusion of the study.

      Problem: Anxiety prior to surgery is an expected emotion. Research has been conducted on
      methods to reduce anxiety prior to entering the operating room (OR). These studies have
      involved some form of distraction, almost all finding that some form of distraction prior to
      entering the OR decreases both physiologic signs and patient reports of anxiety. Very few of
      these studies have carried the intervention into the OR itself. Steris Corporation has
      developed an automated surgical suite environmental system, called SignatureSuite™, that
      controls the level of lighting, images on OR monitors, and ambient background audio via
      preset, computerized automation for use before and after anesthesia. The research question
      is: What is the effect of the SignatureSuite OR environment on patient anxiety, patient
      outcome, and OR staff satisfaction? Study methods: The proposed study will be a mixed method
      two arm randomized controlled trial. Randomization will occur at the surgeon level, based on
      SignatureSuite operating room environment (experimental group) versus a standard Marymount
      Hospital operating room environment (control group).

      Data collection: The study will take place in the perioperative department of Cleveland
      Clinic's Marymount Hospital. Patient anxiety will be measured before and after surgery using
      an anxiety visual analog scale (VAS). Qualitative patient data will be gathered from written
      comments. Data about patient characteristics will be retrieved retrospectively by chart
      review. Data about staff satisfaction will be gathered at the conclusion of the patient data
      collection period via visual analog scales and qualitative analysis of written comments. The
      effect of SignatureSuite on OR turnaround time will also be determined at the conclusion of
      the patient data collection period.

      Sample characteristics: The patient sample will comprise patients undergoing thyroid and/or
      parathyroid surgery at Marymount Hospital.

      Sample size: 40 subjects per group will provide adequate power to detect large effect sizes
      (0.80) and is feasible at Marymount Hospital within one year.

    <description>Participants complete an anxiety visual analog scale with endpoints of &quot;No anxiety&quot; to &quot;The most anxiety I can imagine&quot; in the pre-operative holding area after consenting to participate in the study. In the operating room prior to the induction of anesthesia, participants complete anxiety visual analog scale again. Participants complete anxiety visual analog scale in the post-anesthesia care unit as soon as they feel capable of holding the clipboard and pen to mark the paper and again just prior to discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit. The difference in scores for each time period will be used in the analysis.</description>

    <intervention_name>SignatureSuite™ OR Integration System by STERIS Corporation</intervention_name>
    <description>SignatureSuite™ OR Integration System by STERIS Corporation is a product that includes software to control the audio and visual components of the operating room in order to provide a more relaxed and calming environment for patients prior to their surgery. It automatically dims lights, plays pleasant music or sounds of nature over the in-room speakers, and provides scenes of nature on video screens stationed in viewing range of the patient. As anesthesia is administered to the patient, the system automatically adjusts the light and sound systems to come up to surgeon-preferred preset stations. The process happens in reverse as the patient emerges from general anesthesia so that they awaken in the same environment as when they arrived in the OR.</description>
