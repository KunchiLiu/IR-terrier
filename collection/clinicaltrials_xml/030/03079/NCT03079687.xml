      This is an open-label, single-arm, international, multicenter Multiple Patient Expanded
      Access Program (MPEAP). The program is designed to provide treatment access to olaparib
      tablets for patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian,
      fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer without other treatment options or eligible for
      an olaparib clinical trials.

      The Multiple Patient Expanded Access Program is designed to provide treatment access to
      olaparib tablets for patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial
      ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response
      or partial response) following platinum-based chemotherapy. The dose of olaparib tablets is
      300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 600 mg.
      The 100 mg tablet is available for dose reduction. Treatment may continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent. The program will
      collect observational data only.
