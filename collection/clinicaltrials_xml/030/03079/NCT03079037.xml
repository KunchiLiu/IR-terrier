  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting specific
      changes in oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation will prove superior to continuous
      isochronal DBS thus providing the rationale for development and optimization of closed loop
      paradigms and determine whether the optimal closed-loop biomarker varies across subcortical
      targets, is task dependent, or serves to re-establish a default network that removes an
      underlying disruptive physiological state leading to greater improvement in motor signs and
      task performance.
