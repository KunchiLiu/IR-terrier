  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance misuse is a common problem among HIV+ individuals. Research suggests that a
      Screening, Brief Intervention, and Treatment (SBIRT) model can be effective in reducing
      substance misuse in the general older adult population; however these findings have not been
      verified in the more vulnerable HIV+ older adult population. The present study seeks to
      address the problem of substance misuse in older HIV+ adults by piloting a SBIRT model for
      older HIV+ adults in a in a primary care setting.

      The current project will pilot SBIRT with a peer navigator (SBIRT-PN) versus treatment at
      usual (TAU) to increase substance use treatment engagement among HIV-positive adults aged 50
      years and older. We will recruit patients from the Southern HIV and Alcohol Research
      Consortium (SHARC) HIV primary care clinic network.

      Aim 1: Pilot effectiveness of SBIRT-PN versus TAU in HIV primary care clinics to improve
      substance-use treatment engagement and HIV appointment adherence among adults aged 50 and
      older. Hypothesis 1: Individuals randomized to SBIRT-PN will be more likely to engage in
      substance-use treatment, have fewer substance use days and have fewer HIV missed clinic
      appointments compared to those in TAU at 30 days, 3 and 6 month post-intervention follow-up.

      Aim 2: Describe the influence of demographic factors, depression and pain on substance-use
      treatment engagement outcomes. Hypothesis 2: Demographic factors, greater depression and
      greater pain at baseline will be associated with more substance use days and more missed HIV
      clinic appointments at 30 days, 3 and 6 month post-intervention follow-up.

      Aim 3: Examine and enhance feasibility (recruitment, dose, retention) of intervention uptake
      for a larger trial. We will randomly sample 15 patients from the intervention arm and do
      qualitative interviews in order to characterize intervention barriers and key intervention
      components that facilitate success.

    <description>The interventionist will discuss substance use and misuse, HIV, and the interaction of aging and substance use; will give the patient feedback on their NM-ASSIST score and assess the patient's readiness to change based on Prochaska's stages of change; motivational interviewing techniques to identify the patients' most salient reasons for addressing substance use issues. Identifying and prioritizing need; problem-solving techniques to help patients identify which services may best help them work towards their goals; will use a referral resource guide to provide the contact information of agency representatives and help the patient formulate a plan for follow-up.</description>
