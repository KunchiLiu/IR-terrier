    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of eccentric exercise combined
      with vibration or cryotherapy in Achilles tendon pathology.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the combined eccentric exercise is better than the
      results presented by the exclusive eccentric exercise.

      This intervention differs from the classic studies in that we maintain the intensity
      throughout the treatment.
