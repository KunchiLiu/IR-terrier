  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of daprodustat compared to rhEPO for
      treatment of anemia associated with CKD in subjects who are starting dialysis or who have
      recently started dialysis. Previous trial in dialysis subjects with anemia associated with
      CKD demonstrated that daprodustat could maintain hemoglobin up to 24 weeks with minimal
      effects on plasma erythropoietin (EPO) concentration. Daprodustat is postulated to be
      associated with fewer major adverse cardiovascular events by raising hemoglobin without the
      supraphysiologic EPO concentrations associated with intravenous (IV) rhEPO therapy,
      potentially avoiding blood pressure (BP) elevations and other adverse effects of high EPO
      levels. This randomized, open-label (sponsor blind) study will comprise three study periods:
      a screening period of 2 weeks (can be extended by an additional 4 weeks as needed), a
      52-week active treatment period, and a follow-up period of 4 to 6 weeks. Approximately 300
      subjects or 150 subjects per treatment group will be randomized 1:1 to receive daprodustat
      or rhEPO (darbepoetin alfa).
