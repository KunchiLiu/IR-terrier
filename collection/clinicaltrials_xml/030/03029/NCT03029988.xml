  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the use of Tc 99m tilmanocept as an imaging agent in
      subjects with known active liver metastasis from colorectal carcinoma by comparing
      previously acquired (within 30 days of tilmanocept injection) FDG PET images .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of Tc 99m
      tilmanocept administered either subcutaneously or intravenously. SPECT/CT imaging of the
      subject's abdominal cavity will be reviewed to establish concordance with images previously
      acquired with FDG PET imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has provided written informed consent with Health Information Portability
             and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization before the initiation of any
             study-related procedures.

          -  Subjects must be ≥18 years old;

          -  Have a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon and/or rectum with FDG PET confirmed
             metastases to the liver;

          -  Subjects must have an ECOG performance status of 0-3;

          -  Subjects must be at least 4 weeks past any major intra-abdominal surgery, including
             surgery to the liver;

          -  Subjects with prior malignancies other than colon and/or rectum cancer are allowed,
             provided they have been treated with curative intent, and have no evidence of
             recurrence of that malignancy;

          -  Each subject must have no more than 10 qualifying liver lesions that have been
             clinically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon by PET imaging.

          -  If of childbearing potential, the subject has a negative pregnancy test within 48
             hours before administration of Tc 99m Tilmanocept, has been surgically sterilized, or
             has been postmenopausal for at least 1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is pregnant or lactating.

          -  The subject has undergone any liver surgery, exclusive of a biopsy.

          -  The subject has known sensitivity to dextran.

          -  The subject has had preoperative chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy
             within the 10 days prior to Tc 99m Tilmanocept administration

          -  Before the administration of Tc 99m Tilmanocept, has received any radiopharmaceutical
             within 7 radioactive half-lives of that radiopharmaceutical

          -  Has received an investigational product within the 30 days prior to Tc 99m
             Tilmanocept administration
