  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of chronic
      neuropathic pain. Half of the participants will be assigned to a group with recording /
      stimulation to one pain-related circuit of the brain while the other half of participants
      will be assigned to recording / stimulation to a different pain-related circuit of the
      brain. Relief of pain symptoms with stimulation will be studied in both groups. It is
      hypothesized that neural signals will correlate with pain states and that DBS can disrupt
      these pain states in both groups.

      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of DBS in a small cohort of patients with
      chronic pain refractory to conventional treatments. The study will involve the implantation
      of a neurostimulator, the Medtronic Activa PC+S device, to examine the efficacy of two modes
      of DBS. Open-loop DBS will provide stimulation based on a pre-set schedule, whereas
      closed-loop DBS will deliver stimulation based on brain activity associated with pain
      states. The goals of this study are to identify neurophysiological correlates of elevated
      pain states and find DBS parameters that disrupt pain-related brain activity and provide
      pain relief with little or no side effects. The efficacy of site-specific stimulation will
      also be studied.
