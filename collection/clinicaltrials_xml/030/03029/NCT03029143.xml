  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of vedolizumab intravenous (IV) dose
      optimization on mucosal healing compared with the standard vedolizumab IV dosing regimen at
      Week 30 in participants with ulcerative colitis (UC) and high vedolizumab clearance, based
      on a Week 5 predefined serum vedolizumab concentration threshold (&lt; 50 µg/mL) and who are
      Week 6 non-responders.

      The drug being tested in this study is called Vedolizumab. Vedolizumab will be administered
      as an IV infusion. It is being tested in this study with new doses. This study will
      investigate the efficacy and safety of dose optimization of vedolizumab IV, compared with
      standard dosing of vedolizumab IV, over a 30-week treatment period.

      The study will enroll approximately 200 moderately to severely active patients with
      ulcerative colitis in order to randomize 100 nonresponder patients. Participants will
      receive induction therapy of vedolizumab IV 300 mg on Day 1 and Week 2 (Lead-in Period). At
      Week 5, serum vedolizumab concentration will be measured. At Week 6, participants will be
      assessed for clinical response based on partial Mayo score.

      Results of both Week 5 vedolizumab concentration and Week 6 clinical response will determine
      the treatment pathway. Those who are non-responders based on partial Mayo score at Week 6
      and who are assessed as having high vedolizumab clearance, based on a predefined Week 5
      serum vedolizumab concentration threshold (&lt;50 µg/mL) will be randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Vedolizumab IV Standard Treatment

        -  Vedolizumab IV Dose Optimized

      All randomized participants will receive vedolizumab IV either 300 mg or 600 mg every 4 or 8
      weeks.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States of America and Canada. The
      overall time to participate in this study is 56 weeks. Participants will make multiple
      visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone, 6 months after last dose of study
      drug for a long term follow-up safety survey.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Mucosal Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Mucosal healing is defined as Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1 point. Mayo score is used in clinical trials to assess Ulcerative Colitis disease activity. It consists of 4 subscales: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy and physician's global assessment. Each subscale is scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0= normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a complete Mayo score of ≤2 points and no individual subscore &gt;1 point. Mayo score used in clinical trials to assess Ulcerative Colitis disease activity. It consists of 4 subscales: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy and physician's global assessment. Each subscale is scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0= normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <description>Clinical response is defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from Baseline (Day 1) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point. Mayo score used in clinical trials to assess Ulcerative Colitis disease activity. It consists of 4 subscales: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy and physician's global assessment. Each subscale is scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0= normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <description>Clinical response based on partial Mayo score is defined as a reduction in partial Mayo score of ≥2 points and ≥25% from Baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point. The partial Mayo score is a discrete ordinal scale ranging from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and is a composite of 3 subscores: stool frequency subscore, rectal bleeding subscore, and physician's gobal assessment subscore, each of which ranges from 0 = normal to 3 = severe disease. The total partial Mayo score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
