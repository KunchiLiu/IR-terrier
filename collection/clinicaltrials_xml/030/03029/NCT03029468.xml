  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a
      multimedia computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) program for reducing SCD pain
      symptoms in a single-arm pilot pragmatic clinical trial. The investigators will recruit 40
      SCD patients with chronic pain or on chronic opioid pain treatment to receive 8 sessions of
      cCBT through our Web- and smartphone-based iCanCope with SCD program and weekly follow-up
      with a care coach. Participants will also use the iCanCope smartphone app to track daily
      pain intensity, pain interference and mood. The primary outcomes of the trial include
      feasibility (recruitment, retention, provider and patient feedback) and acceptability
      (sessions completed) of the iCanCope SCD program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to provide the experiences and data that will support a
      later, larger, and adequately powered effectiveness trial of the iCanCope SCD, computerized
      cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) program. The investigators hypothesize that iCanCope SCD
      is acceptable, i.e., patients will use it (90% of users will complete the first lesson
      within 3 months; 70% will completeÂ³4 sessions; 50% of users will complete all 8 sessions),
      and feasible, i.e., the investigators can recruit &gt;80% of patients approached, and &gt;90% of
      enrolled participants will complete their 6-month follow-up assessment. The investigators
      will also have preliminary data on effectiveness and hypothesize that 70% of cCBT users will
      achieve a &gt;50% decline in daily pain ratings.

      The investigators will enroll 40 SCD patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
      (UPMC) with chronic pain or on opioid therapy for chronic pain into the iCanCope SCD program
      and follow them for 12 months. While the investigators have already implemented routine
      stress/pain screening in the UPMC Adult Sickle Cell Clinic, the investigators will utilized
      EpicCare &quot;best practice alerts&quot; (BPA) that enable physicians to efficiently refer their
      patients to studies at the time of the patient encounter in response to an automated
      electronic alert. The investigators will utilize both methods to identify patients with SCD
      who have chronic pain as indicated by self-report &quot;I have had pain nearly every day for at
      least 3 months&quot; or have been prescribed long-acting opioids for pain (BPA).

      Following confirmation of protocol-eligibility and informed consent, participating patients
      are provided with a large-screen smartphone with the iCanCope smartphone app that includes
      symptoms self-monitoring and our GPS tracking features pre-installed; this will allow
      tracking of pain and mood as well as any opioid or non-opioid pain treatments used by
      patients, and steps traveled. Patients enrolled in iCanCope will complete eight 1-hour cCBT
      sessions over 3 months using their study-provided smartphone. Because cCBT programs are less
      effective without a human support component, participants will also be introduced to a care
      coach (master's level tech who has been trained in CBT) who will contact the participant on
      a weekly basis by phone/text and as needed for up to 3 months. The care coach will reinforce
      CBT materials and encourage engagement. Participants will have continued access to the
      program after 3 months, but without care coach support.

    <description>Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) for pain via an integrated smartphone and web-based skills training program: The training plan will help users learn how to recognize negative thoughts and emotions, use cognitive skills and problem-solving, and apply coping behaviors such as distraction, activity scheduling, and relaxation. The cCBT arm emphasizes skills acquisition and learning through practice; thus, the program involves regular homework assignments, and follow-up with the care coach and social network about issues faced and what skills were or could be used. This intervention is consistent with the tailored behavioral services patients would receive individually or as a group when working with a psychologist or behavioral pain specialist.</description>
