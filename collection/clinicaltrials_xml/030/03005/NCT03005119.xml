  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, parallel-group study. Sixty (60) MS
      patients will be enrolled. PTL201 doses will be titrated over a one-week period until
      reaching MTD for each participant. The MTD will be administered for three weeks thereafter.
      Participants demonstrating response to treatment will continue self administering daily
      PTL201 treatment or placebo, for an additional four weeks. Participants will fill a daily
      diary.

    <textblock>
      A Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, parallel-group study. Spasticity is
      one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of MS, Cannabinoids reduce pain and
      spasticity in MS patients.

      PTL201 capsules contain 5 mg THC and 5 mg cannabidiol (CBD). PTL201 doses will be titrated
      over a one-week period until reaching maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each participant
      (participants will be told they may receive placebo or active treatment, although all
      treatments will be active). The MTD will be self administered for three weeks thereafter.
      Participants demonstrating response to treatment will continue self administering daily
      PTL201 treatment or placebo, for an additional four weeks. Participants will keep a daily
      diary.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient (male or female), age 18-65 years

          2. Definite diagnosis of MS, according to McDonald 2010 criteria, at least six months
             prior to enrollment, with MS associated spasticity for at least 3 months prior to
             enrollment

               1. Patients suffer from moderate to-severe MS-associated spasticity (≥4 sNRS), with
                  no adequate response to traditional antispastic medications

               2. EDSS score: 4 ≤ EDSS ≤ 6; functional motor score ≥3.0 Safety, tolerability and
                  efficacy of PTL201 in reducing multiple sclerosis-associated spasticity-related
                  symptoms
