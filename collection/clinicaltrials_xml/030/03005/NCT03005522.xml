  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An individual's quality of life can be seriously affected by the severity of dental pain.
      The emergency department is a common place to find those seeking relief from their dental
      pain- often times seeking removal of the affected tooth, dental anesthetic injections or
      oral pain medications. There are a number of dental infections that cause this type of
      debilitating pain. One such dental infection is termed periapical abscess. This infection
      involves the tooth pulp. These infections can arise in three ways: introduction through a
      defect in the enamel and dentin; from a periodontal pocket or an adjacent tooth; or
      hematogenous seeding of the pulp from mechanical irritation. As this disease process
      continues there are a number of complications including chronic pain and, more seriously,
      the spread of infection into deep spaces which can be a life threatening condition.

      The Emergency Department treatment of this infection includes pain control, antibiotics and
      dental referral for ultimate management of the infection.

      The purpose of our study is to investigate whether the addition of oral steroids will alter
      the time until patient experiences improvement in their dental pain. Steroids are a commonly
      used anti-inflammatory that is used in the Emergency Departmentfor the purpose of pain
      relief from throat pain. As the pain from periapical infection is thought to be largely from
      the pressure we speculate that the anti-inflammatory effects of steroids may decrease the
      inflammation thus the pressure and may ultimately lead to a decrease in time until the
      patient experiences some relief from their pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients included if they had clinical diagnosis of pulpitis/dental apical abscess and
        physical exam revealed pain with percussion of the affected tooth/teeth plus or minus
        evidence of periapical abscess (gingival erythema, swelling, draining pus). Written
        informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to enrollment in the study.-
