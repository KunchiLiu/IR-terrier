        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women â‰¥18 years of age

          -  Dose escalation cohorts: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed
             diagnosis of malignancy (including lymphoma) with demonstrated progression of a tumor
             for whom there is no available therapy likely to convey clinical benefit AND who have
             not been previously treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. These patients do not
             require measurable disease

          -  Dose expansion cohorts: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed
             diagnosis of 1 of specified tumors with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 or Lugano
             criteria. Some patients may have been previously treated with a PD-1 or PD-L1
             inhibitor

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with any LAG-3 targeting biologic or small molecule

          -  Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomization and not recovered to baseline
             from any AE due to radiation

          -  Untreated or active central nervous system metastases

          -  Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease

          -  Corticosteroid therapy (&gt;10 mg prednisone/day or equivalent) within 1 week prior to
             the first dose of study drug

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months

          -  Documented allergic or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to antibody
             treatments
