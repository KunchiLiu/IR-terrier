  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based upon the possible implication of microbiota and abnormal microbial metabolites such as
      altered bile acids, in the pathogenesis of PSC, emerging data suggests that oral
      antibiotics, such as vancomycin and metronidazole, may have therapeutic effects in this
      overlap syndrome or PSC.

      The goal of our study is to evaluate role of antibiotics and microflora in children with
      AIH/PSC overlap syndrome or with PSC alone. The investigators hope to learn what effects
      oral antibiotics has on the bacteria present in stool, and hope to learn to characterize
      human intestinal microbial communities, in children suffering from overlap syndrome or PSC.

      The hypothesis of the investigators is that overlap syndrome and PSC develop due to altered
      microflora and the resulting abnormal bile acids pool. The outcome of overlap syndrome or
      PSC could be affected by presence or absence of RCUH. Antibiotics to correct the microflora
      may result in disease/cholangiopathy remission.

      The used antibiotic is Metronidazole (Flagyl) or Vancomycine, during 14 days, as induction
      therapy or rescue therapy.

      Study participants will provide blood and stool samples in order to evaluate bile acids
      profile and microbiome, before and after the course of metronidazole, and then comparison
      will be made pre- and post-antibiotics.

      The investigators will determine the benefit of oral metronidazole therapy through
      improvement of clinical symptoms and improvement of liver function tests.
