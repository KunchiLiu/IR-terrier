  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to assess
      the efficacy and safety of venetoclax co-administered with low dose cytarabine (LDAC) versus
      LDAC co-administered with placebo in treatment na誰ve participants with acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured up to 2 years after the last participant is enrolled</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years after the last participant is randomized</time_frame>
    <description>This will be calculated based on current International Working Group (IWG) criteria. CR is defined as absolute neutrophil count greater than 10^3/ microliter (mcL), platelets greater than or equal to 10^5/mcL, red cell transfusion independence, and bone marrow with less than 5% blasts. CRi is defined as bone marrow with less than 5% blasts, and absolute neutrophils of less than 10^3/mcL or thrombocytopenia less than or equal to 10^5/mcL (100,000/mcL)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Event-free survival (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years after the last participant is enrolled</time_frame>
    <description>EFS will be defined as the number of days from randomization to the date of progressive disease, relapse from CR to CRi, treatment failure, or death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with CR or CRi recovery (CR + CRi) by the initiation of Cycle 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after the last participant is randomized</time_frame>
    <description>This will be calculated based on current International Working Group (IWG) criteria. CR is defined as absolute neutrophil count greater than 10^3/ microliter (mcL), platelets greater than or equal to 10^5/mcL, red cell transfusion independence, and bone marrow with less than 5% blasts. CRi is defined as bone marrow with less than 5% blasts, and absolute neutrophils of less than 10^3/mcL or thrombocytopenia less than or equal to 10^5/mcL (100,000/mcL)</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cancer Fatigue Short Form [SF] 7a</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years after the last participant is enrolled</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cancer Fatigue Short Form (SF) 7a global fatigue score. PROMIS Cancer Fatigue SF 7a is a seven item questionnaire that assesses the impact and experience of fatigue over the past 7 days.</description>

    <measure>Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years after the last participant is enrolled</time_frame>
    <description>Global health status/quality of life will be assessed using the GHS/QoL scale from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core (EORTC QLQC30).</description>
