  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant Aromatase Inhibitor-associated toxicity, affects as many as 50% of patients with
      breast cancer leading to early discontinuation of this life-saving cancer treatment. No
      effective pharmacologic therapy has yet been identified for management of these symptoms, as
      many patients do not experience relief of symptoms with analgesic therapy. Vitamin B12,
      whether as injection or oral forms, has been used as a naturopathic product to provide
      relief for joint pain caused by arthritis. This effect has not been studied in the setting
      of Aromatase Inhibitor-Associated Musculoskeletal Symptoms (AIMSS).

      Primary Objectives:

      a. To assess whether daily oral Vitamin B12 decreases average joint pain in women with
      aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS), as measured at baseline, 6
      weeks and at 12 weeks by the modified Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To investigate whether daily vitamin B12 improves functional quality of life as
           measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Scale (FACT-ES);

        2. To explore the impact of treatment on serum inflammatory cytokine levels (C Reactive
           Protein) with 12 weeks of treatment between baseline and 12 weeks.
