    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the role of colchicine in the prevention of atrial fibrillation in
      patients undergoing open heart surgery. Half of participants will receive colchicine and the
      other half will not

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery and is estimated to occur in 26% of all cardiac surgery patients. It can lead to
      increase morbidity, mainly due to hemodynamic instability and thromboembolic complications,
      and to increased hospital stay with its associated higher health care cost.

      Previous studies have demonstrated that increased inflammation may precede AF and,
      therefore, interventions that reduce the inflammatory process may help reduce the incidence
      of AF. Colchicine has potent anti-inflammatory properties and may therefore be capable of
      reducing the incidence of AF.

      This study aims to determine whether the administration of colchicine starting the day
      before cardiac surgery and continuing until discharge may lead to reduction in
      post-operative AF.
