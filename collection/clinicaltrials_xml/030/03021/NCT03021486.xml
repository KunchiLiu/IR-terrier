  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if chlorpromazine, high-dose
      haloperidol, or a combination of the 2 drugs can help to control the symptoms of delirium
      (loss of contact with reality) in patients with advanced cancer who did not respond to
      low-dose haloperidol. High-dose haloperidol doses are usually about 2-4 times the size of
      low-dose haloperidol.

      In addition, researchers want to learn if treating patients with these drugs can help to
      lessen any distress that their caregivers may be having.

      The safety of these drugs will also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible and agree to take part, you will be randomly assigned (as in
      a roll of the dice) to 1 of 3 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance of
      being in each group.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive haloperidol.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive chlorpromazine.

        -  If you are in Group 3, you will receive haloperidol and chlorpromazine.

      Neither you nor the study staff will know which study drug you are receiving. However, if
      needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving.

      Study Drug Administration You will receive the study drug(s) by vein over about 3-15 minutes
      every 4 hours until you are discharged from the palliative care unit or you withdraw from
      the study. You may receive additional doses every 1 hour, if needed. The dose level and
      length of administration may be raised or lowered to meet your needs.

      Length of Treatment You may continue receiving the study drug(s) for as long as you are in
      the palliative care unit. You may stop receiving the study drug(s) at any time that you
      and/or your caregiver decides it is in your best interest.

      Baseline Procedures

      Before your first dose of the study drug(s):

        -  Your demographic information (such as age, sex, date of birth, race, marital status,
           and education), medical information, and cancer history will be recorded.

        -  You will complete a test to measure your level of delirium. To complete this test, the
           study doctor will ask you to complete several thinking tasks, such as recalling a set
           of numbers or words, remembering different objects, and stating what day it is. This
           test should take less than 10 minutes to complete.

        -  You will complete 1 questionnaire about any symptoms you may be having. This should
           take about 5 minutes to complete.

      Study Procedures:

      Every 8 hours during the first 24 hours that you are in the palliative care unit, you will
      repeat the symptoms questionnaire. After the first 24 hours, you will complete the
      questionnaire 1 time each day until you are discharged.

      If and when you recover from the delirium, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire
      about your experience with delirium. This should take about 5 minutes to complete. Your
      active participation on this study will be over at that point.

      This is an investigational study. Both chlorpromazine and haloperidol are FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of bipolar disorder and psychotic disorders. Their
      use to help control delirium is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study
      drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 54 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
