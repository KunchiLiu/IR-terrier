    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of intraoperative use of lidocaine
      intravenous infusion on the postoperative analgesic consumption after adult spine surgery.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double blind and randomized study. Patients will be randomly
      allocated into two groups of equal size to receive either lidocaine infusion (lidocaine
      group/G1) or 0.9% saline infusion (control group/G2). Randomization will be performed using
      G1 and G2 registers, which will be placed in sealed envelopes prior to study initiation and
      opened prior to anesthesia by a physician who will prepare the intravenous solution and will
      identify it with the patient number, according to the envelope drawn. The solution was
      handed to another physician, blind to the prepared solutions' content, who will be
      responsible for the anesthesia. The solution volume was equal.

      The responsible investigator will remain blind to the chosen group until the end of the
      study. Lidocaine group patients (n = 20) will receive a loading dose of lidocaine 2 mg 谈 kg
      slowly IV just before induction of anesthesia, then the lidocaine infusion started at a rate
      of 3 mg 谈 kg/h, and control group patients (n = 20) will receive an equal volume of 0.9%
      saline (both the loading and the infusion), the infusion will be initiated at the time of
      induction of anesthesia and continued until the end of the operation.
