      This study aims to characterise the use of single-agent olodaterol and single-agent
      indacaterol, the only marketed LABAs authorised for COPD, but not for asthma, in clinical
      practice.

      Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (BI) developed olodaterol, an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist
      (LABA), for the indication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Because the use
      of LABAs has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with asthma,
      the health authorities requested the conduct of a post-approval drug utilisation study to
      assess potential off-label use of olodaterol in asthma and to characterise the use of
      olodaterol in clinical practice. The single agent indacaterol, the only other marketed LABA
      authorised in clinical practice for COPD but not for asthma, will also be assessed. Study
      objectives include the following: (1) Quantify the frequency of off-label use of olodaterol
      and indacaterol among new users of these medications; and (2) Describe the baseline
      characteristics of new users of olodaterol and indacaterol. This cross-sectional study will
      use information among new users of olodaterol or indacaterol collected in the following
      healthcare databases: the PHARMO Database Network in the Netherlands, the National Registers
      in Denmark, and the IMS Health Information Solutions (IMS) Real-World Evidence (RWE)
      Longitudinal Patient Database (LPD) in France. The source population is all patients
      enrolled in the selected study databases at the date olodaterol became available in each
      database's country. The study groups are those patients from the source population who
      receive a first dispensing for single-agent formulations of olodaterol for the primary
      objective or indacaterol for the secondary objective and have at least 12 months of
      continuous enrolment in the study databases. The study will describe the number and
      proportion of new users by indication and potential off-label use and according to medical
      history and use of co-medications.

        The study source population includes all patients enrolled in the selected study databases

        study is planned to be conducted in the following databases: the PHARMO Database Network
        in the Netherlands, the National Registers in Denmark, and the Real-World Evidence (RWE)
        Longitudinal Patient Database (LPD) in France.
