      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab and recombinant
      interleukin-12 in treating patients with solid tumors. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Recombinant
      interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating
      white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Giving pembrolizumab and recombinant interleukin-12
      may work better in treating patients with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      recombinant human interleukin (rhIL)-12 in combination with pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Evaluate the safety of the regimen by
      continuously monitoring adverse events that will be documented utilizing Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v).4.

      III. Evaluate the overall response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      [RECIST] v.1.1) and the progression free survival of patients enrolled on the study.

      IV. Measure CD8+ T cell infiltration by immunohistochemistry in tumor biopsies obtained at
      baseline, after one week of rIL12 and after 2 cycles of pembrolizumab-IL12.

      V. Conduct exploratory translational laboratory correlative studies utilizing banked
      biospecimens (tumor and blood) obtained at baseline and during therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of recombinant interleukin-12.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Beginning 1 week
      before the start of course 1, patients receive recombinant interleukin-12 subcutaneously
      (SC) on days 2 and 5. Patients then receive recombinant interleukin-12 SC on days 2 and 5 of
      weeks 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.
