  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) can lead to a short-term increase of herpes
      virus-related illnesses including genital herpes flares, higher likelihood of varicella
      zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) uveitis or other end-organ disease, and herpes
      simplex virus (HSV) associated encephalitis. Herpesvirus reactivation upon ART initiation
      may be related to immune restoration disease of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
      (IRIS), but the etiology is unclear. We hypothesize that ART initiation can induce
      herpesvirus reactivation causing increased cellular, systemic, and localized immune
      activation and that alterations of interferon (IFN) pathways during initial HIV viral
      suppression are involved in this reactivation.

      To investigate these mechanisms, we propose to document the incidence of clinical herpetic
      disease and viral shedding in vaginal and oral secretions from HIV-positive women initiating
      ART and to assess the associations between viral shedding or clinical disease and cellular,
      mucosal, and systemic immune activation. We will determine the role of IFN pathway in
      herpesvirus reactivation following initiation of ART. We will also evaluate the potential
      impact of herpesvirus reactivation on HIV cellular reservoirs by comparing residual HIV
      plasma viral replication and cell-associated virus prior to and 52 weeks after ART
      initiation.

      We propose to recruit up to 200 HIV-infected women initiating ART at the NIH Clinical Center
      (n=30 to 40) and the Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) site in Kalisizo, Uganda (n=160 to
      170). Women will be recruited regardless of CD4+ T-cell count, presence of opportunistic
      infections and co-infection status. Pregnant women will be excluded. During 8 study visits
      to occur over a 12-month period, participants will receive standard-of-care treatment for
      HIV and opportunistic infections. Blood, vaginal fluid and oral swabs collected at study
      visits will be tested for viral levels of HIV and various herpesviruses. Vaginal samples
      will also be used to study differences in vaginal microbiota between women with and without
      herpetic disease prior and after ART. Plasma samples will be tested for antibody levels
      (IgG) specific for different herpesviruses to examine changes in anti-herpetic humoral
      responses. ART adherence will be monitored in plasma using high-resolution mass
      spectrometry.
