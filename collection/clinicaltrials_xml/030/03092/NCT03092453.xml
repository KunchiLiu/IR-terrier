      Single arm open label trial assessing the safety and tolerability of mDC3/8 Vaccine (Primer
      and Booster) in subjects with stage III and stage IV melanoma followed by treatment with
      Pembrolizumab.

      After consent and screening, subjects will have apheresis performed at approximately day -7
      followed by cyclophosphamide 300mg/m^2 intravenously or by mouth on day -4 to -3. On Day 1
      the subject will receive parin vaccine dose (mature DC 7.5-15 million/peptide) followed by
      two booster doses (every 6 weeks) of mature DC 1-5 million/peptode. Re-staging will occur
      after the 3rd DC vaccine along with tumor biopsy and second apheresis. Anti PD-1 therapy
      (standard of care) will commence 7-8 weeks after the subjects' last DC vaccine.
