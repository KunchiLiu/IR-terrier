  <brief_title>Azacitidine With or Without Nivolumab or Midostaurin, or Decitabine and Cytarabine Alone in Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia or High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>

    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well azacitidine with or without nivolumab or
      midostaurin, or decitabine and cytarabine alone work in treating older patients with
      previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, decitabine, and cytarabine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may
      interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Midostaurin may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      azacitidine with or without nivolumab or midostaurin, or decitabine and cytarabine alone may
      kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To select, based on overall survival, any or all of the &quot;Novel Therapeutic&quot; regimens for
      further testing against azacitidine in patients age 60 and older with newly diagnosed acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome with excessive blasts-2 (MDS-EB-2).
      (Phase II) II. To compare overall survival of the &quot;Novel Therapeutic&quot; regimens selected in
      the phase II portion of the trial to azacitidine in this patient population. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of the regimens in these patient
      populations.

      II. To estimate response rates, event-free survival, and relapse-free survival for these
      regimens in these patient populations.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate associations between cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities and outcomes
      for each of the regimens in this patient population.

      II. To bank specimens for future correlative studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) daily on days
      1-7 or days 1-5 and 8-9. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive azacitidine as in Arm A and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1
      and 14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive azacitidine as in Arm A and midostaurin orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) on days 8-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM D:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive decitabine IV on days 1-5 and cytarabine IV continuously on days
      6-11. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients deemed stable at the discretion of the treating physician receive
      decitabine as in Induction. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 2 years.
