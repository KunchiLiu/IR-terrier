  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Appropriate use of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) including dose-reduction is important for
      patient's safety in T2DM patients with renal impairment (RI). However, there are
      insufficient data on dose adjustment in accordance with the prescription pattern and the
      risk of RI of OADs, in particular DPP-4 inhibitors, in clinical practice in Japan.
      Therefore, we will investigate OADs usage conditions and dose selection in T2DM patients
      with RI in clinical practice in Japan
