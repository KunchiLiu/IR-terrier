    <textblock>
      The study will enroll well-compensated cirrhotic as well as non-cirrhotic subjects treatment
      experienced with an NS5a Inhibitor + sofosbuvir and will include patients who did not
      complete the prescribed duration due to adverse event or any reason other than for non/poor
      compliance. Subjects will be randomized to 12 or 16 weeks of treatment.

      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir and
      pibrentasvir (G/P) for 12 weeks to G/P for 16 weeks in non-cirrhotic NS5A (non-structural
      protein 5a)-inhibitor plus sofosbuvir ± RBV (Ribavirin) treatment-experienced adults with
      HCV genotype 1 (GT1) infection, and to compare the efficacy and safety of G/P with RBV for
      12 weeks to G/P without RBV for 16 weeks in NS5A-inhibitor plus sofosbuvir (SOF) ± RBV
      treatment-experienced adults with compensated cirrhosis and GT1 infection.

    <intervention_model_description>Up to 225 subjects will be enrolled into four study arms A, B, C and D containing Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir (G/P) with or without Ribavirin (RBV).
Approximately 75-90 non-cirrhotic subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Arms A and B, and approximately 110-135 subjects with compensated cirrhosis will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arms C and D. Randomization will be stratified by HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) genotype 1 subtype (1b or non-1b).
Subjects without cirrhosis will be randomized 2:1 to:
Arm A: G/P 300 mg/120 mg QD (once a day) for 12 weeks
Arm B: G/P 300 mg/120mg QD for 16 weeks
Subjects with compensated cirrhosis will be randomized 1:1 to:
Arm C: G/P 300 mg/120 mg QD + weight-based RBV (Ribavirin) BID (twice a day) (1000 mg or 1200 mg total daily dose) for 12 weeks
Arm D: G/P 300 mg/120 mg QD for 16 weeks</intervention_model_description>
