  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the superiority of sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo on Hemoglobin A1c
      (HbA1c) reduction at Week 26 in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who have inadequate
      glycemic control with a sulfonylurea alone or in combination with metformin.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo based on:

        -  Change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG).

        -  Change from baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) for patients with baseline SBP
           ≥130 mm Hg.

        -  Change from baseline in SBP for all patients.

        -  Change from baseline in body weight.

        -  Proportion of patients with HbA1c &lt;6.5% and &lt;7.0%.

        -  To evaluate the safety of sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo throughout the 79-week
           trial.

      The duration per patient is up to 85 weeks, including a Screening Period consisting of a
      Screening phase of up to 2 weeks and a 2-week single-blind Run-in phase, a 26-week double
      blind Core Treatment Period, a 53 week double blind Extension, and a 2-week post treatment
      Follow-up period to collect safety information.
