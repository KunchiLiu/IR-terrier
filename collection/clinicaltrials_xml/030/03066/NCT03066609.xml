        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must give a written, signed and dated informed consent.

          2. Men or women at least 18 years of age at time of screening.

          3. Chronic plaque-type psoriasis present for at least 6 months and diagnosed before
             Baseline.

          4. Moderate to severe psoriasis as defined at Baseline by:

               -  PASI score of 12 or greater, and

               -  IGA mod 2011 score of 3 or greater (based on a static scale of 0 - 4), and

               -  Body Surface Area (BSA) affected by plaque-type psoriasis of 10% or greater.

          5. Candidate for systemic therapy. This is defined as a subject having moderate to
             severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis that is inadequately controlled by

               -  topical treatment and/or,

               -  phototherapy and/or,

               -  previous systemic therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Forms of psoriasis other than chronic plaque-type (e.g., pustular, erythrodermic and
             guttate psoriasis) at Screening or Baseline.

          2. Drug-induced psoriasis.

          3. Ongoing use of prohibited treatments.

          4. Previous exposure to secukinumab (AIN457) or any other biologic drug directly
             targeting IL-17 or the IL-17 receptor.

          5. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 5 half-lives
             of enrollment, or within 30 days until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has
             returned to baseline, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local
             regulations.

          6. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.
