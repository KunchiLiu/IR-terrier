  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of LCZ696 over individualized
      medical therapy for comorbidities in reducing N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide
      (NT-proBNP) and improving HF symptoms and functional capacity in patients with heart failure
      with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Clinical Summary Score (CSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The KCCQ is a self-administered questionnaire that requires 4 to 6 minutes to complete. It contains 23 items, covering physical function, clinical symptoms, social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and Quality of Life (QoL). The CSS is a combined score based upon the clinical symptoms and physical function domains of the questionnaire. Scores are transformed to a range of 0 - 100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in NYHA functional class from baseline to week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>NYHA classification is a subjective physician's assessment of patient's functional capacity and symptomatic status and can change frequently over time.
Class I - No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms of HF Class II - Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in symptoms of HF Class III - Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes symptoms of HF Class IV - Unable to carry on any physical activity without symptoms of HF, or symptoms of HF at rest
The NYHA class change will be analyzed as a three category ordinal variable with levels: &quot;improved&quot;, &quot;unchanged&quot;, and &quot;worsened&quot;, defined by at least one class improvement, no change, at least one class worsening, in NYHA class, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) score score to week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a widely used and extensively studied instrument to measure health-related quality of life among healthy patients and patients with acute and chronic conditions. It consists of eight subscales that can be scored individually: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. This analysis will report change in symptoms as measured by the physical component summary (PCS) score at Week 24.</description>

    <description>All patients who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be stratified before randomization based upon prior therapy for comorbidities to one of 3 strata: ACEi, ARB or no RASi. Patients in the ACEi strata will receive LCZ696 or enalapril. Patients in the ARB strata will receive LCZ696 or valsartan. Patients in the no RASi strata will receive LCZ696 or matching placebo.
Patients in the ACEi and ARB strata will take two pills twice daily for each dose: one tablet from the LCZ696 pack and one tablet from the comparator pack. Patients in the no RASi strata will take only one tablet twice daily (LCZ696 or matching placebo).
In the LCZ696 arm, patients will receive active LCZ696 in titrated doses from level 1 up to level 3 (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg twice daily orally).</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the comparator arm will receive either enalapril (ACE stratum) valsartan (ARB stratum) or LCZ696 matching placebo (no RASi stratum).
Patients in the ACE stratum randomized to comparator, will receive enalapril in titrated doses from level 1 up to level 3 (2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily).
Patients in the ARB stratum randomized to comparator will receive valsartan in titrated doses from level 1 up to level 3 (40 mg , 80 mg and 160 mg twice daily).
Patients in the no RASi stratum randomized to comparator will receive LCZ696 matching placebo.</description>
