  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if poziotinib can help to control
      EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is locally advanced or metastatic (has
      spread). EGFR-positive NSCLC means that there is a mutation (a type of genetic change) on
      the EGFR gene.

      The safety of poziotinib will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will take 2
      poziotinib tablets by mouth 1 time every day while participant is on study. Each dose should
      be taken at about the same time each day (preferably in the morning) with a glass (about 8
      ounces) of water.

      If participant misses a dose, participant should take it as soon as possible on the same day
      with a return to the normal schedule the following day. Participant should not take any
      extra doses on the following day to make up for any forgotten doses.

      Participant will be given a pill diary to complete. Participant should record in the diary
      each dose of poziotinib participant takes, including when participant took it. Participant
      should bring this diary with participant to each study visit.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to
      follow study directions.

      Participation in this study will be over after follow-up.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 (+/- 7 days) of all cycles and Day 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At Week 16, participant will have an EKG. If participant's doctors thinks it is needed,
      participant may have additional EKGs during the study. Participant's doctor will discuss
      this with participant.

      At Month 3 and every 6 months after that, participant will have an ECHO or MUGA scan.

      Every 8 weeks, participant will have an CT scan and/or an MRI to check the status of
      participant's disease.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      About 30 days after participant's last dose of study drug:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA scan.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      Every 6 months, participant will come to the clinic to have an ECHO or MUGA scan. During
      these visits participant will be asked how participant is doing and if participant has
      started any new drugs or treatment. If participant cannot come to the clinic, participant
      will be called by the study staff to answer these questions. Each call should last about 10
      minutes.

      Participant will continue to have CT scans or MRIs every 8 weeks (+/- 14 days). If the
      disease appears to get worse, participant will stop having these scans.

      This is an investigational study. Poziotinib is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drug
      is designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
