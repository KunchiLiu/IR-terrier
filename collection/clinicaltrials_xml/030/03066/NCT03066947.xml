  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label study of BriaVax™, a targeted immunotherapy for breast
      cancer. Eligible patients will have histological confirmation of breast cancer with
      recurrent and/or metastatic lesions. The treatment regimen includes a pre-treatment with
      low-dose cyclophosphamide 2-3 days before the vaccination; inoculation of the vaccine in 4
      sites on the thighs and upper back; and post-treatment inoculation of Interferon-alpha-2b
      into the sites of vaccination ~2 and 4 days after the vaccination. These is repeated every 2
      weeks for one month (3 treatments), then monthly for up to one year. Standard tumor
      assessments are performed at baseline and then every 3 months.

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label study of BriaVax™ in recurrent and/or metastatic breast
      cancer. The detailed treatment regimen follows:

      Pre-Vaccine Regimen:

      Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 300 mg/m2 I.V., 1x only, will be given 48-72 hours before each
      vaccine, with an antiemetic of the provider's choice (steroids prohibited).

      Vaccine Day Standard Operating Procedures:

        1. Inquire regarding events of past weeks, change in medications, pain scale, ECOG scale,
           and review of systems.

        2. Check vaccine injection sites.

        3. Perform DTH skin test intra-dermally with the BriaVax™ parent cell line (~1e6
           irradiated tumor cells). Observe about 20 minutes for acute hypersensitivity. Grade III
           or higher acute hypersensitivity will abort therapy.

        4. Inject vaccine 0.5 ml intra-dermally into thighs and upper back. Monitor patients for
           60 minutes. Vital signs will be assessed and medical attention will be warranted if
           unstable.

      Vaccine Preparation &amp; Inoculation Regimen:

      Each vaccine inoculation will be administered via intra-dermal injection at the
      investigational sites. Subjects will receive 15-25 x 106 viable, irradiated transfected
      breast tumor cells in a total volume of 2.0 ml Ringer's lactate. Tumor vaccine cells will be
      irradiated to ensure cell replication incompetency.

      Vaccine will be divided into four aliquots of 0.5 ml each and prepared with coded study
      labels &quot;Investigational Use Only&quot;, and hand-delivered by qualified sponsor's staff to the
      principal investigator's office on the day of the scheduled inoculation, where it will be
      injected intra-dermally; one each into the anterior skin of the subject's right and left
      thighs and over the right and left upper back . Application of anesthetic lidocaine crème
      may be used if necessary for control of local pain before inoculation. Subjects will be
      monitored for 60 minutes.

      After at least 9 subjects have been treated safely with this regimen, the dose of BriaVax™
      may be escalated or decreased in subsequent patients based on the emerging data.

      Post-Inoculation Regimen:

      48 hours (±24 hours) after vaccine, and again 96 hours (±24 hours) later after vaccine, the
      patient will return to the principal investigator's office to receive Interferon-alpha-2b
      (Merck) in 0.1 ml saline, prepared as follows: These will also be provided by the sponsor in
      individual syringes with coded labels, and injected intra-dermally to each vaccine site,
      beneath the thickest area. Again, subjects will be observed about 20 minutes. The DTH
      response will also be recorded in the EDC at the 48 hour (±24 hours) visit.

      This vaccine cycle will be performed every 2 weeks for the first month of treatment (3
      vaccinations), and then every month for up to one year.
