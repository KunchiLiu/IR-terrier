    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of EA in pediatric patients undergoing
      minor ENT surgery under Sevoflurane and compare opioid-only based intra-operative analgesia
      to multi-modal analgesia consisting of opioid and IV acetaminophen or PO acetaminophen
      regimen using a validated and standardized EA measurement tool, the Pediatric Anesthesia
      Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale. [Appendix 1]. The post operative pain scores will be
      measured in all patients by post-op recovery staff using FLACC Score/Wong-Baker FACES
      (patients 24 months up to 7 years of age) or Numeric Pain Score for patients 7 years of age.
      The pre-operative, surgery, anesthesia and post-operative staff will be all blinded.

      Hypothesis: Using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale, the incidence of
      Emergence Agitation associated with the use of intra-operative multi-modal analgesia is
      lower than opioid-only based intra-operative analgesia in children undergoing minor ENT
      surgery. The findings of this study assessing common neurobehavioral and neurocognitive
      disturbances after anesthesia and surgery can serve as an investigative platform for future
      studies involving other types of surgery, and adult patients and be examined when compared
      to other multimodal analgesic regimens. This novel approach using recently-approved
      non-opioid analgesics can serve an as example in how future multi-modal therapies can be
      instituted.

      Place of Study: Nemours Children's Hospital, Orlando, Florida (Primary Site)

      Study Design:

        1. Prospective Randomized Study

        2. Study Period: April 2017 - August 2017

        3. Study Population: 30 pediatric patients in each group between 12 months and 7 years of
           age undergoing minor ENT procedures (tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy,
           adenoidectomy)

        4. Total Number of Patients: 90

           Methods and Materials: With IRB Committee approval and written consent from all parents
           or guardians and assent in children age 7, 90 patients between the ages of 24 months -
           7 years, scheduled for tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, will be randomly divided
           into three groups of 25 patients. Each group will receive sevoflurane induction and
           maintenance of anesthesia. Sevoflurane, currently the most commonly used agent for
           inhalational induction, will be used for induction of anesthesia, as it is less
           irritating to the tracheobronchial tree than other volatile anesthetic agents and is
           considered the standard for pediatric induction anesthesia. Children with severe sleep
           apnea defined as Apnea-Hypoxia Index greater than 10, developmental delay or
           psychological disorders, will be excluded. Also, patients and/or families that show
           inability to understand research consent due to English proficiency will be excluded.
           None of the patients will receive premedication for sedation. Any patient that requires
           premedication will be excluded from this study.

           In the pre-operative area, all patients will receive a de-identified PO syrup. The
           syrup will be prepared by the pharmacy and will contain acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) for
           the PO acetaminophen group and placebo flavored syrup for the other two groups. This
           approach will maintain blindness of the peri-operative staff, and patients/parents.
           Patients unable to take PO (acetaminophen or placebo) will be excluded from the study.

           Induction of anesthesia will be accomplished via inhalation of sevoflurane (8 vol%) in
           nitrous oxide (70%) and oxygen (30%) at a fresh gas flow of 10 Lpm. An IV will be
           established and propofol 2mg/Kg will be administered to facilitate endotracheal
           intubation. After intubation, all children will receive fentanyl 2 mcg/Kg IV. Intra-op
           anesthesia team will be blinded to the use of non-opioid IV analgesia and will
           administer a pharmacy prepared de-identified infusion following intubation that will
           consist of saline placebo for control groups and IV acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) for the IV
           acetaminophen group. For maintenance of anesthesia, children will receive sevoflurane
           (maximum of 2.0±0.2 MAC, age adjusted) with a constant fresh gas flow of 2 L/min
           (maximum FIO2 of 40% air mixed with oxygen), using a semi-closed circle breathing
           system. Ventilation will be controlled to maintain normocapnia (ET-CO2 32-38 mmHg).
           Additional doses of fentanyl can be administered, per anesthesiologist's discretion, in
           all groups by increments of 0.5 mcg/Kg IV per dose for hemodynamic response to surgical
           stimulation greater than 20% above baseline. Removal of the mouth gag for
           tonsillectomy/tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy/adenoidectomy will be defined as the end
           of surgery. At this point, inhalation anesthetic will be discontinued. Fresh gas flow
           will be increased to 8 Lpm, 100% oxygen. Tracheal extubation will be performed when
           normal ventilation is achieved and cough or gag reflex is regained.

           Children with a history of severe sleep apnea as described, developmental delay or
           psychological disorders will be excluded. All patients will not receive any
           premedication for sedation. Any patients that require premedication will be excluded
           from this study.

           Intraoperative/Post-Operative Standardization: The surgical technique will be
           standardized and a limited group of surgeons limited to two surgeon per clinical site
           will be recruited for the study. No peri-tonsilar local anesthetic injection will be
           used. The number of anesthesia providers involved in the study will also be limited to
           minimize variability and to execute a standardized intra-operative management. The
           post-operative pain management approach will be restricted to fentanyl (0.5 mcg/Kg
           IV/dose titrated to effect) for moderate to severe pain. Ibuprofen (10mg/Kg) PO will be
           ordered for mild to moderate post-op pain. Post-op recovery staff will be limited to a
           maximum of three trained recovery room nurses per study site and will use
           FLACC/Wong-Baker FACES (patients 24 months up to 7 years of age) or Numeric Pain Score
           for patients 7 years of age. to assess level of pain Episodes of clinical emergence
           delirium will receive rescue treatment. This treatment will consist of 0.5 - 1.0 mcg/Kg
           IV dexmedetomidine.

           Measurements: Age, gender, height, weight, procedure, duration of surgery, agents used,
           duration of anesthetic exposure and time from discontinuation of anesthetic to
           extubation will be documented for each patient. A blinded PACU nurse will record degree
           of agitation using the PAED scale on admission to the PACU every 15 minutes for
           approximately 1 hour after admission, or until discharge from the PACU, whichever comes
           first. Modified Aldrete scores (respiration, O2 saturation, consciousness, circulation,
           activity) and adverse events (nausea, vomiting, shivering, breath-holding, excessive
           secretions, laryngospasm, excessive bleeding) will also be recorded. Children will be
           considered discharge ready with an Aldrete score ≥9, and this will also be recorded.

           Statistical Analysis: All statistical analysis will be performed in SPSS v23 (IBM
           Corp.). Data will be assessed for normal distribution via Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For
           continuous variables, normally distributed data will be analyzed using t-test and
           ANOVA. Non-normal distributions will analyzed with non-parametric methods (Mann-Whitney
           U). For discrete/categorical variables, Chi-squared and gamma testing will be performed
           as appropriate. Time-dependent data will be analyzed via ANOVA with repeated measures
           or Wilcoxon-Ranked Sum testing as appropriate based normal distribution testing. All
           testing will be performed with α=0.05 to determine statistical significance.
