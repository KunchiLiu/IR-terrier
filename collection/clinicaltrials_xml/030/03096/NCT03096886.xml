  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit a total of 100 participants: 60 with MDD from the Outpatient Clinics of the
      University of Pennsylvania and 40 matched comparison participants. MDD participants will all
      receive computer-augmented skills training with the GDA protocol. Half of the MDD
      participants initially will be randomized to Depression Care Management (DCM) (supportive
      management as a &quot;placebo&quot; comparator for CCBT) and subsequently will receive CCBT treatment.
      All participants will receive fMRI scanning at baseline and again following either 8 weeks
      of CCBT or 8 weeks of DCM. Brain activity will be compared between MDD and controls at
      baseline and between CCBT-treated vs DCM-treated at 8 weeks. At the conclusion of 8 weeks
      the DCM-treated participants will receive an 8-week course of CCBT and will have a 3rd fMRI
      scan at the conclusion of CCBT, allowing within-subject comparison of CCBT vs DCM treatment
      effects.

      This study is a randomized study. 60 subjects with MDD will be randomly assigned (1:1) to
      immediately receive 8 weeks of CCBT or delayed treatment, consisting of an initial 8 weeks
      of Depression Care Management (DCM), followed by 8 weeks of CCBT. 40 healthy controls of
      similar age/sex will be recruited to serve as a comparison group for baseline MRI scanning.

      The study will enroll subjects for approximately 4 years (~2 subjects per month for 48
      months). The length of subject participation will vary based on what group the participants
      are randomized to. Healthy controls will participate for approximately 1-3 week. Subjects
      with MDD who were randomized to immediate CCBT will participate for approximately 8-10
      weeks; subjects with MDD who were randomized to delayed CCBT (with DCM) will participate for
      approximately 16-19 weeks. Variability in the study duration for each group depends on each
      subjects' personal availability for visits and the availability of the MR.

      Potential participants will complete a phone screen to determine eligibility. If the
      individual is eligible, they will be scheduled for an in-person screening visit. Information
      collected during the phone screening will not be used in the data analysis; phone screening
      information will be collected and retained in REDCap.

      Screening Visit - all participants will have the study described to them in detail,
      including the risks and study procedures as outlined in the informed consent form and will
      sign the ICF and HIPAA authorization, prior to any study procedures being completed.
      Participants will be screened for symptoms of psychological disorders and severity of major
      depressive symptoms by a trained research team member.

      If determined eligible, HEALTHY CONTROLS will be scheduled for return to complete an fMRI
      scan and baseline visit, in which self-report measures, including reports of mood, behavior,
      and thoughts will be collected, as well as neuropsychological testing.

      If determined eligible at screening, MDD (EXPERIMENTAL GROUP) participants will be
      randomized (1:1) as follows: One half of the depressed participants will be randomized to
      receive 8 weeks of CCBT immediately after completing pretreatment assessments and the
      remainder will be randomized to 8 weeks of Depression Care Management (DCM). Following DCM
      they will then receive 8 weeks of CCBT.

      MDD, IMMEDIATE CCBT GROUP CCBT participants will be scheduled for return to complete an fMRI
      scan and baseline visit, in which self-report measures, including reports of mood, behavior,
      and thoughts will be collected, as well as neuropsychological testing.

      Participants will complete Good Days Ahead (GDA) computer training throughout the 8 weeks of
      CCBT. They will have CBT Clinical Contact with a licensed psychologist/psychiatrist at
      multiple time points during this period, as well. Additionally, outcome measures will be
      assessed by an independent clinical evaluator (without knowledge of treatment assignment)
      every other week. As soon as can be arranged after the Week 8 study visit (last CCBT
      Clinical Contact), participants will return to complete an fMRI scan and end of study visit,
      in which self-report measures, including reports of mood, behavior, and thoughts will be
      collected, as well as neuropsychological testing.

      MDD, DCM (Followed by CCBT) Group DCM participants will be scheduled for return to complete
      an fMRI scan and baseline visit, in which self-report measures, including reports of mood,
      behavior, and thoughts will be collected, as well as neuropsychological testing.

      During the DCM phase, Participants will meet for clinical contact (30 minute sessions with a
      psychologist/psychiatrist) and outcome measures multiple times during the 8 week DCM phase.

      During the Week 8 study visit, participants will complete a second fMRI scan and end of DCM
      visit, in which self-report measures, including reports of mood, behavior, and thoughts will
      be collected, as well as neuropsychological testing.

      Participants will then enter the CCBT phase the following week and will complete Good Days
      Ahead (GDA) computer training throughout the 8 weeks of CCBT. They will have CBT Clinical
      Contact with a licensed psychologist/psychiatrist at multiple time points during this
      period, as well.

      Additionally, outcome measures will be assessed by an independent clinical evaluator
      (without knowledge of treatment assignment) every other week during this study phase. As
      soon as can be arranged after the Week 17 study visit (last CCBT Clinical Contact),
      participants will return to complete a 1-hour fMRI scan and end of study visit, in which
      self-report measures, including reports of mood, behavior, and thoughts will be collected,
      as well as neuropsychological testing.

    <masking_description>An experienced clinical evaluator with established reliability will assess patients pre-treatment and biweekly (weeks 2-16). All evaluations will be conducted without knowledge of treatment assignment. The evaluator will assess symptom severity according to the MADRS and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Evaluators will have offices remote to the day-to-day operations of the treatment study and will not participate in weekly study management meetings in order to help preserve the blind.</masking_description>
