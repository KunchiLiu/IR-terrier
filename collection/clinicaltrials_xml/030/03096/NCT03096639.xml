      A randomized clinical trial to investigate the use of the temporary Diaphragm Pacing Therapy
      System (DPTS) to rehabilitate the diaphragm in mechanically ventilated patients who have
      failed at least two weaning attempts. The goal is to strengthen and rehabilitate the
      diaphragm to liberate the patient more quickly from mechanical ventilation.

    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life saving technology but can also cause damage to the
      lungs and diaphragm such as ventricular induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD). Research
      has shown that after being on mandatory MV and sedated the diaphragm begins to atrophy
      within as short as 18 hours. The Lungpacer Diaphragm Pacing Therapy System (DPTS) is a
      temporary therapy that consists of the Lungpacer IntraVenous Electrode Catheter (LIVE
      Catheter) and the Lungpacer Control Unit system. The LIVE Catheter is a proprietary central
      venous catheter that incorporates pacing electrodes in strategic areas that align with the
      left and right phrenic nerves. The LIVE Catheter can also be used for fluid delivery like
      any other central venous catheter. The randomized clinical trial will investigate the
      safety, effectiveness and performance of the Lungpacer DPTS. By stimulating the diaphragm
      through daily therapy sessions, with the intention of exercising and rehabilitating the
      diaphragm muscle so the patient may be able to be more quickly liberated from MV. The
      patient population includes those who have been mechanically ventilated for greater than or
      equal to 7 days, have failed two or more spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and were not
      hypervolemic during the latest spontaneous breathing trial. Patients must have resolution of
      the initial indication for placement on mechanical ventilation before entering the trial.

    <description>Diaphragm Pacing intervention will be conducted 3x a day using the Diaphragmatic Pacing Therapy System (DPTS). The DPTS includes the Lungpacer IntraVenous Electrode Catheter (LIVE Catheter) which is inserted temporarily into the left subclavian vein, the Lungpacer Control Unit (LCU external unit) and an intermediate cable that connects the LCU to the LIVE Catheter.</description>

             extubation with subsequent reintubation within 48 hours is considered a failed SBT).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  currently on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO);

          -  weaning failure due to hypervolemia;
