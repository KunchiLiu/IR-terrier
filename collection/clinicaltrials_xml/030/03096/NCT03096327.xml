      1.1 Background

      Asthma is characterized by airway and lung tissue inflammation and airway
      hyperresponsiveness (AHR) that leads to recurrent symptoms of wheezing, breathlessness,
      chest tightness, and coughing. AHR indicates an exaggerated response of the airway to
      nonspecific stimuli, which results in a temporary airflow limitation, leading to airway
      obstruction. It remains unknown which factors within the airway of an individual trigger
      reversible airway obstruction and airway narrowing. The airway epithelium is composed of
      many interacting structural components and inflammatory cells. The number, activation, and
      secretory component of inflammatory cells in the airway are altered in the disease. In
      asthma, the number of eosinophils and T lymphocytes is increased in the subepithelial layer.

      The impact of asthma has traditionally been measured in terms of the prevalence of the
      disease, mortality rates, and levels of healthcare utilisation, particularly hospital
      admissions. However, the impact of asthma extends beyond these outcomes to include effects
      on lifestyle, wellbeing, and perceived health status. Adults of working age with asthma have
      poorer health status and quality of life outcomes than those with no asthma. This effect is
      independent of confounding by sociodemographic and life style factors and is evident across
      a range of dimensions of quality of life. In comparison with two other chronic health
      conditions, asthma has a larger adverse impact on health status and quality of life than
      diabetes.

      1.2. Investigational Agent

      Montelukast reversibly inhibits cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), specifically leukotrienes
      D4 (LTD4 [3]. LTD4 is the most potent bronchoconstricting agent on a molar basis, but
      Cys-LTs also have chemoattractive properties for many inflammatory cells (mainly
      eosinophils), effects on vascular permeability, mucous secretions and sensory nerve
      activation, and are responsible for part of the pathophysiology of asthma.

      1.3. Dose Rational/Risk &amp; Benefit

      Montelukast is a potent and selective blocker of the CysLT1 receptor. For treatment of
      chronic asthma, montelukast is administered once daily to adults as a 10-mg film-coated
      tablet, to children aged 6-14 years as a 5-mg chewable tablet, and to children aged 2-5
      years as a 4-mg chewable tablet form. Given their efficacy, antiinflammatory activity, oral
      administration, and safety, leukotriene modifiers will play an important role in the
      treatment of asthmatic patient. Side effects most commonly reported above placebo included
      headache, otitis media, upper respiratory infection, and pharyngitis.

    <masking_description>To ensure double-blind allocation, the sponsor, who is not directly involved in clinical team will use a random number sequence generated by a computer software to allocate the participant to either the treatment or placebo group. Patients who will be randomized to the treatment group will receive 10 mg montelukast. Patients in placebo group will receive identical looking drug (placebo) produced by same manufactured.
Both products will be packaged in identical plastic bottles identifiable only by the patient allocation number. Patient will be asked to take one montelukast each day. Acceptable compliance will be defined as at least taking medication at least 21 days. The patients will be instructed to leave the remaining tablets in bottle so that they would be counted later.</masking_description>
