  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood pressure variability (BPV) is being increasingly recognized as an important influence
      on hypertension outcomes as well as a risk factor for other cardiovascular (CV) events.
      However, in Asia there is a current lack of awareness of BPV and its significance on patient
      outcomes. Furthermore, there is ongoing debate on the role of home blood pressure (HBP)
      monitoring in managing hypertension patients and uncertainty on how best to integrate it
      into clinical practice.

      Therefore, we conduct Asia BP@Home study to assess HBP control status in each Asian country
      and develop an Asian consensus and Asia-specific treatment for hypertension.

      Blood pressure variability (BPV) is being increasingly recognized as an important influence
      on hypertension outcomes as well as a risk factor for other cardiovascular (CV) events.
      However, in Asia there is a current lack of awareness of BPV and its significance on patient
      outcomes. Furthermore, there is ongoing debate on the role of home blood pressure (HBP)
      monitoring in managing hypertension patients and uncertainty on how best to integrate it
      into clinical practice.

      The main purpose of this study is to:

        -  Assess HBP control status in each Asian country

        -  Develop an Asian consensus and Asia-specific treatment for hypertension

        -  Improve the management of hypertension in Asia by encouraging patients to monitor HBP
