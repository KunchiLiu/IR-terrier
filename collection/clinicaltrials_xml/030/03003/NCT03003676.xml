  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, phase I pilot study of sequential ONCOS-102 and pembrolizumab in
      patients with advanced or unresectable melanoma progressing after PD1 blockade. The primary
      objective of the study is to determine the safety of sequential treatment with ONCOS-102
      followed by pembrolizumab. The protocol aims to enroll 6 patients into each of two cohorts:
      prior PD1 monotherapy or prior combination PD1 plus ipilimumab combination therapy.

          -  Histopathologically confirmed melanoma with an injectable cutaneous or lymph node
             metastasis that has progressed in the opinion of the treating investigator despite
             administering a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anti-PD1 agent, with or
             without ipilimumab, as the most recent systemic intervention.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 1.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1.

          -  Acceptable coagulation status: international normalised ratio (INR) of blood
             clotting, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time within ≤1.5 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Completion of local therapy, such as radiation, surgical resection, injectable
             immunebased therapy, or topical pro-inflammatory agent, 21 days prior to first dose
             of protocol therapy.

          -  Resolution or stabilization of clinically significant immune-mediated adverse events
             from prior therapy such that continued PD1 blockade is not contraindicated in the
             opinion of the principal investigator.

          -  Clinical stability of brain metastases for at least 4 weeks prior to first day of
             study therapy.

          -  Acceptable liver and renal functions defined as:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (does not include patients with Gilbert's Disease)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT)
                  ≤3.0 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN

          -  Acceptable haematological function defined as (Patients can be transfused to meet the
             haemoglobin entry criteria):

          -  Able to provide valid written informed consent.

          -  All women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test at screening.

             treatment and for 2 months after the last virus treatment and 4 months after the last
             dose of chemotherapy and pembrolizumab.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A concomitant medical condition requiring receipt of a therapeutic anticoagulant that
             in the opinion of the treating physician cannot safely be held to allow for
             therapeutic injection of ONCOS-102 and tumor biopsies.

          -  A concomitant medical condition that in the opinion of the treating physician would
             pose unreasonable additional risk to therapeutic injection of ONCOS-102.

             most recent episode of documented progression on an anti-PD-1 agent (with or without
             ipilimumab) prior to enrollment. Targeted therapies such as dabrafenib and/or
             trametinib and injectable therapy with talimogene laherparepvec are allowed if they
             were followed by progression on anti-PD1 therapy.

          -  Any symptomatic autoimmune disease (such as lupus, scleroderma, Crohn's disease,
             ulcerative colitis) that requires administration of &gt;10mg of prednisone equivalent.
             Lower dose steroids for conditions such as hypophysitis are allowed.

          -  Any prior severe adverse event attributed to prior anti-PD1 therapy that, in the

               -  Grade 4 AST or ALT elevation

               -  Grade 3 or higher colitis attributable to PD1 blockade; note that colitis
                  attributable to ipilimumab is not excluded

               -  Note: in the absence of clinical symptoms of pancreatitis, elevations of amylase
                  or lipase are not contraindications to therapy on this trial

          -  Known active infection with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), or HIV.
             Cleared HBV/HCV infection is not an exclusion, nor is HIV infection with cluster of

          -  Active bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic therapy.

          -  History of organ transplant.

          -  Patients requiring chronic systemic immunosuppressants, including steroids
             (prednisone daily equivalent of &gt;10 mg).

          -  Brain metastases that are clinically unstable (e.g. showing unequivocal growth on
             imaging, requiring radiation therapy, or steroids &gt;10mg of prednisone equivalent)
             within 4 weeks of first dose of study drug.

          -  Known severe congenital or acquired cellular or humoral immunodeficiency such as
             common variable immunodeficiency.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding currently or are planning to do so during or
