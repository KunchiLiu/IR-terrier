          3. Current AHA Class I or II indication/prescription for telemetry monitoring

          4. Prescription for other continuous condition monitoring such as capnography or pulse
             oximetry

          5. Ongoing opioid therapy by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), by epidural or
             intrathecal infusions or by intravenous analgesia

          6. Ventilated or intubated patients at the time of enrollment
