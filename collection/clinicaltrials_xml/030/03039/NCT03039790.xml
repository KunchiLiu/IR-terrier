  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate descriptively the long-term immunogenicity of at
      least 1 Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine (NoV) vaccine administration.

      The drug being tested in this study is called Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent Virus-Like
      Particle Vaccine (NoV Vaccine). NoV vaccine is being tested for protection against acute
      gastroenteritis (AGE) due to norovirus.

      The study will enroll approximately 800 participants. Participants who previously received
      NoV vaccine in studies NOR-107, NOR-210, NOR-204 and NOR-222 will be enrolled. Participants
      from study NOR-107 will enter the study at the time of their 3rd year post-primary
      vaccination, from studies NOR-210 and NOR-204, at their 2nd year post-primary vaccination,
      and from study NOR-222, at the time of their 1st year post-primary vaccination. The duration
      of participation in the study will be different for each participant.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Belgium and United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is maximum 5 years after primary NoV vaccination. Participants
      will have a maximum of 5 visits over 5 years.

        protocol as initially described.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in any clinical trial is allowed, on condition that no investigational
             product is administered within 30 days prior to blood sampling.
