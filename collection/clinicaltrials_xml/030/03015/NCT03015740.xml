  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable or recommended
      dose of MGCD5 that can be given with nivolumab to patients with kidney cancer. Researchers
      also want to learn if this dose can help to control the disease. The safety of this drug
      combination will also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      assigned to 1 of 4 dose levels based on when participant joins this study. The dose of
      MGCD516 participant receives will depend on how well previously enrolled participants
      tolerated the study drug. All participants will receive the same dose of nivolumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 14 days (2 weeks).

      Participant will take MGCD516 by mouth every day while participant is on study. Each dose
      should be taken in the morning at about the same time each day. Participant should take
      MGCD516 at least 2 hours after and 1 hour before participant's next meal. For example,
      participant can take participant's dose in the morning at least 1 hour before breakfast.

      Participant will be given a study drug diary to keep track of when participant takes each
      dose and if participant misses or vomit any doses. Participant should return any empty study
      drug bottles or leftover study drug to the clinic at the beginning of each cycle.

      Participant will also receive nivolumab by vein over 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and
      beyond. Participant will not receive nivolumab during Cycle 1.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue to receive the study drugs for as long as the study doctor thinks
      it is in participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is
      unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      Every 2 weeks:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At Week 6 and then every 12 weeks after that (Weeks 18, 30, 42, and so on):

        -  Participant will have an MRI and/or CT scan. If needed, participant may also have an
           x-ray or bone scan.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the level of sugar in participant's
           blood. Participant must fast for 8 hours before this test.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, urine will be collected for routine tests.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 30 days after participant's last dose of study drugs:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  If participant stopped taking the study drugs because of a side effect and depending on
           when participant's last scan was, participant will have an MRI and/or CT scan. If
           needed, participant may also have an x-ray or bone scan.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Participant will be called by a member of the study staff every 3 months to ask how
      participant is doing and if participant has started any new anti-cancer treatments. This
      information may be collected from participant's medical record instead. This phone call
      should take about 5-10 minutes.

      These calls will stop if participant decides participant no longer wants to take part in
      this study.

      This is an investigational study. MGCD516 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only. Nivolumab is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of many types of cancer, including kidney cancer.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
