    <textblock>
      There is a clear need in spine surgery to place pedicle screws in the right place in the
      spine with good accuracy to avoid damage to important structures (spinal cord, nerve roots
      or vertebral arteries). The objective of the study is to investigate the accuracy of screw
      placement during spine surgery.
