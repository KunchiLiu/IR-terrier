      Evaluation of the effectiveness of aquatic therapy for the treatment of freezing of gait in
      Parkinson's disease patients undergoing a multidisciplinary and intensive rehabilitation
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FoG) is an often dramatic, disabling episodic gait pattern that is common
      in Parkinson's disease (PD). FoG highly impairs mobility, causes falls, and reduces quality
      of life. Given the limited effectiveness of both the dopaminergic therapy and the deep brain
      stimulation on this symptom, it represents a challenge in the field of rehabilitation. In
      the last years, some studies described the effectiveness of aquatic therapy on balance
      dysfunction in patients with PD, correlating it to the safe conditions offered by the
      aquatic environment and to the physical properties of water. Nevertheless, the issues
      concerning the feasibility and the effectiveness of aquatic therapy for the treatment of FoG
      have never been addressed before. The aquatic environment may act on the sensorial
      peripheral receptors, thus widely stimulating the proprioceptive system. PD patients show an
      altered processing of the proprioceptive information that could potentially underline FoG.
      The investigators aim at investigating the effects of aquatic therapy for the treatment of
      FoG in PD patients undergoing a Multidisciplinary Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment (MIRT),
      whose effectiveness on several motor and functional parameters has been already
      demonstrated.

    <description>MIRT consists of a 4-week rehabilitation program in a hospital setting, which entails four daily sessions of physical therapy for five days and one hour of physical exercise on the sixth day. On the seventh day the patient rests. The duration of each session, including recovery periods, is about one hour. The first session consists of a one-to-one session with a physical therapist. The second session includes aerobic exercises to improve balance and gait, using different devices: a stabilometric platform with visual cues, a treadmill plus and a cycloergometer. The third session consists of occupational therapy, the fourth one includes one hour of speech therapy.</description>

    <description>Patients in the MIRT-AT group will undergo the land-based therapy described in MIRT plus three sessions per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) of aquatic therapy. On days of aquatic therapy the first session of MIRT was not provided. The aquatic therapy program included aerobic exercises and physical activities to improve balance, motor skills, coordination and joints mobility. The water sessions were divided into 3 phases: i) Warm Up Exercises, ii) Central session Training, iii) Cool-down.</description>
