  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is an option to treat mitral valve failure
      when no surgical options exist. In as many as half of patients, TMVR can cause
      life-threatening blockage of the left ventricle by displacing the existing mitral valve
      leaflet. For these patients the only options appear to avoid TMVR or in some to cause a
      focused heart attack and to wait 6 weeks. The investigators have developed and tested a
      technique to tear the existing mitral valve leaflet and enable TMVR in patients who have no
      other options. The procedure is called intentional laceration of the anterior mitral leaflet
      to prevent left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LAMPOON). Although there are no
      dedicated TMVR devices commercially available, there has been short-term success with
      implanted transcatheter aortic valve devices in the mitral position for TMVR.

      The purpose of this study is to perform LAMPOON and TMVR in patients who have no good
      options to treat their mitral valve failure, using heart valve devices designed to implant
      in the aortic valve position.

    <description>The LAMPOON procedure has three steps: (1) leaflet traversal with a guidewire, followed by (2) leaflet laceration, immediately followed by (3) TMVR. These are all guided by fluoroscopy combined with TEE or intracardiac echocardiography.</description>

    <description>The Astato 0.014&quot; guidewire is used for transcatheter electrosurgery in two steps in this procedure. First it is used for leaflet traversal during electrification. This procedure is similar to the use of the Astato XS20 and an amputated Asahi Confienza Pro 12 in the transcaval IDE investigation recently published. Second, the midshaft is focally denuded and electrified for the leaflet traversal step.</description>
