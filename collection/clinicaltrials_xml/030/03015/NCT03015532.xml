        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each subject must meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:

          1. Is able to provide written informed consent, adhere to the study visit schedule, and
             complete all study assessments.

          2. Is male or female, and ≥18 years of age at screening.

          3. Is scheduled to undergo primary unilateral TKA under general or spinal anesthesia.

          4. Has an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status of I, II, or III.

          5. Is able to demonstrate motor function by performing a timed 20-meter walk unassisted,
             but with the optional use of a 4-legged walker for balance.

          6. Female subjects are eligible only if all of the following apply:

               1. Not pregnant (female subject of child-bearing potential must have a negative
                  urine pregnancy test at screening and on Day 0 before surgery).

               2. Not lactating.

               3. Not planning to become pregnant during the study.

               4. Surgically sterile; or at least 2 years post-menopausal; or have a monogamous
                  partner who is surgically sterile; or is practicing double-barrier
                  contraception; or practicing abstinence (must agree to use double-barrier
                  contraception in the event of sexual activity); or using an insertable,
                  injectable, transdermal, or combination oral contraceptive approved by the US
                  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for greater than 2 months prior to screening
                  and commits to the use of an acceptable form of birth control for the duration
                  of the study and for 30 days after study drug administration. Male subjects must
                  be sterile (biologically or surgically) or commit to the use of a reliable
                  method of birth control for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject with any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Has a planned concurrent surgical procedure (eg, bilateral TKA).

          2. Has a pre-existing concurrent acute or chronic painful/restrictive physical condition
             that may require analgesic treatment in the postoperative period for pain that is not
             strictly related to the knee surgery and which may confound the postoperative
             assessments.

          3. Has a contraindication or a known or suspected history of hypersensitivity or
             idiosyncratic reaction to bupivacaine (or other local anesthetics), meloxicam (or
             other NSAIDs), oxycodone, morphine, fentanyl, or hydromorphone.

          4. Has known or suspected daily use of opioids for 7 or more consecutive days within the
             previous 6 months.

          5. Has taken long-acting opioids within 3 days prior to surgery, or has taken any
             opioids within 24 hours prior to the scheduled surgery.

          6. Has been administered bupivacaine or any other local anesthetic within 72 hours prior
             to the scheduled surgery, other than for pretreatment prior to a needle placement.

          7. Initiated treatment with any of the following medications within 1 month prior to
             surgery or is taking any of these medications to control pain: selective serotonin
             reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs),
             gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, or COX-2 inhibitors. (Note: If a subject is
             taking one of these medications for a reason other than pain control, then (s)he must
             be on a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to surgery.) Anxiolytics prior to
             surgery are permitted, if necessary.

          8. Has a medical condition such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, participating
             in the study would pose a health risk to the subject. Conditions may include any of
             the following:

               1. History of clinically significant cardiac abnormality such as New York Heart
                  Association class III or IV, myocardial infarction, which resulted in
                  significant clinical abnormalities of electrocardiogram (ECG) or function.

               2. History of impaired kidney or liver function, as defined by aspartate
                  aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase &gt;3 × the upper limit of normal
                  (ULN) and/or creatinine &gt;2 × ULN.

               3. History of known or suspected coagulopathy or uncontrolled anticoagulation.

               4. Loss of sensation in extremities or significant peripheral neuropathy.

          9. Has uncontrolled anxiety, psychiatric, or neurological disorder that might interfere
             with study assessments.

         10. Has any chronic neuromuscular deficit of either femoral nerve function or thigh
             musculature.

         11. Has any chronic condition or disease that would compromise neurological or vascular
             assessments.

         12. Had a malignancy in the last year, with the exception of non-metastatic basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

         13. Has a known or suspected history of drug abuse or a positive drug screen, or a recent
             history of alcohol abuse.

         14. Previously participated in an HTX-011 clinical study or received investigational
             product in a clinical trial within 30 days or within 5 elimination half-lives
             (whichever is longer) prior to surgery, or is planning to take part in another
             clinical trial while participating in this study.

         15. Has a body mass index (BMI) &gt;38 kg/m2.
