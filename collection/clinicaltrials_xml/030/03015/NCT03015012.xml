    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that compared to the provision of population-based dietary
      advice, providing DNA-based dietary advice via personalized nutrigenomics testing (PNT) to 2
      distinct patient populations (patients at risk for type 2 diabetes and transplant
      recipients) will motivate them to adopt healthier dietary habits, lead to greater fat loss,
      increased percent lean mass and therefore improve health and quality of life outcomes for
      both patient populations. The second hypothesis is that dietary strategies related to the
      intake of one or more dietary components of interest will mitigate post-transplant weight
      gain associated with three SNPs of interest.

      This is a randomized clinical intervention trial involving a total of six groups of patients
      (n = 450). The two main patient groups include overweight or obese stable transplant
      recipients and overweight or obese patients who are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Within
      these two main groups, there will be three sub-groups. Patients in each of the two main
      groups will either self-select to be in the control group or will be randomized to receive
      either PNT or standard nutrition intervention (SNI). Baseline data will be conducted
      consisting of a 24-hour recall, food frequency questionnaire and 3-day food records using a
      validated multiple pass method. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) will be conducted to
      assess body composition and to derive percent body fat and lean mass. Weight and height will
      be measured using a weigh scale and stadiometer. Those patients randomized to the PNT group
      will be instructed on a tailored nutrition care plan and physical activity recommendations
      based on their individual nutrigenomics profile. At the same time, the SNI group will be
      instructed on general nutrition and physical activity recommendations for weight loss, which
      include the use of dietary strategies from the standard tool ('Just the Basics') used by
      registered dietitians for transplant patients and patients at risk for type 2 diabetes.
      Monthly email reminders or phone calls (depending on patient's preference) will be sent to
      all participants as a reminder of their nutrition plan. 3 months, 6 months and 12 months
      after baseline data collection and individual nutrition interventions, baseline data will be
      repeated. After the study is complete, participants in the SNI group and control group will
      be offered a nutrigenomics report and consultation with a registered dietitian.

      A paired t-test will be used to assess within group change from baseline to each follow-up
      time point for: BMI, body fat, lean mass, and dietary intake. A repeated measures ANOVA will
      be used to test between group differences from baseline to each follow-up time point for:
      BMI, body fat, lean mass, and dietary intake. If significant mean differences are detected,
      a Tukey's post hoc test will be used to compare differences by group. Statistical
      significance will be determined by P &lt; 0.05. General linear regression models will be used
      to assess interactions between each genotype of interest and each dietary component of
      interest on BMI and body composition from baseline to each follow-up time point.

      Hypotheses: Compared to the provision of population-based dietary advice, providing
      DNA-based dietary advice via personalized nutrigenomics testing (PNT) to 2 distinct patient
      populations (patients at risk for type 2 diabetes and transplant recipients) in which
      overweight and obesity are common concerns, will motivate them to adopt healthier dietary
      habits, lead to greater fat loss, increased percent lean mass and therefore improve health
      and quality of life outcomes for both patient populations. The second hypothesis is that
      dietary strategies related to the intake of one or more dietary components of interest
      (protein, fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, total fat, sodium and calories)
      will mitigate post-transplant weight gain associated with the following SNPs: ACE (rs4343),
      FTO (rs1558902) and MC4R (rs571312).

      Sample Size: No research to date has studied the aforementioned hypotheses. Previously
      published data assessing weight loss in a SNI group compared to a PNT group using a
      randomized clinical intervention model in a different population used a sample of n = 93 and
      an alpha &lt; 0.05 to find statistical significance after 3-7 month follow-up. Similarly,
      nutrigenomics research in the ACE gene (rs4343) found statistical significance using a
      sample of n = 104 and an alpha &lt; 0.05. Since it is feasible for this research, a larger
      sample size (n = 450) will be used to increase power and draw meaningful inferences from the
      data. There will be 150 participants in each patient group (n = 150 in control group, n =
      150 in SNI group, n = 150 in PNT group) in this landmark study.

      Design and Methods: Participants will be recruited from the Canadian Transplant Association
      (CTA) meetings (transplant recipients; n = 225) and from the Group Lifestyle Balance Program
      (GLB Program) at the East Elgin Family Health Team (patients at risk for type 2 diabetes; n
      = 225) for this randomized clinical intervention trial. This trial involves a total of four
      groups of patients. The two main patient groups include overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25
      kg/m^2) stable transplant recipients greater than or equal to 1 year post-transplant and
      overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m^2) patients who are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Within
      these two main patient groups, there will be three sub-groups (n = 150 per group). Patients
      in each of the two main groups will either self select to be in the control group, or be
      randomized to receive either PNT or standard nutrition intervention (SNI) based on
      strategies from the standard teaching tool used by dietitians in both patient populations:
      'Just the Basics' - developed by the Canadian Diabetes Association. Participants at risk for
      type 2 diabetes will participate in the GLB Program and will either complete the standard
      program (SNI Group) or will complete the standard program + receive personalized nutrition
      and physical activity recommendations based on their genetics (PNT Group). Patients who
      self-select the control group will be instructed to continue their current nutrition and
      physical activity regime. Baseline data will be conducted consisting of a 24-hour recall,
      food frequency questionnaire and 3-day food records using a validated multiple pass method.
      Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) will be conducted to assess body composition and to
      derive percent body fat and lean mass. Weight and height will be measured using a weigh
      scale and stadiometer. Those patients randomized to the PNT group will be instructed on a
      tailored nutrition care plan and physical activity level based on their individual
      nutrigenomics profile. At the same time, the SNI group will be instructed on general
      nutrition and physical activity recommendations for weight loss. Monthly email reminders
      will be sent to all participants as a reminder of their nutrition plan, or phone calls
      (depending on the patient's preference). 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after baseline
      data collection and individual nutrition interventions, baseline data will be repeated.
      After the study is complete, participants in the SNI group and control group will be offered
      a nutrigenomics test and consultation with a registered dietitian.

      Statistical Analysis: A paired t-test will be used to assess within group change from
      baseline to each of the follow-up time points for: BMI, body fat, lean mass, water weight,
      and dietary intake (protein, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, unsaturated fat,
      carbohydrates, calories and sodium). A repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test between
      group differences from baseline to each of the follow-up time points for: BMI, body fat,
      lean mass, water weight, and dietary intake (protein, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat,
      unsaturated fat, carbohydrates, calories and sodium). If significant mean differences are
      detected, a Tukey's post hoc test will be utilized to compare differences by group.
      Statistical significance will be determined by P &lt; 0.05. General linear regression models
      will be used to assess the effect of each genotype of interest (ACE rs4343, MC4R rs573112,
      FTO rs1558902) and the impact of each dietary component of interest (protein, total fat,
      saturated fat, trans fat, unsaturated fat, carbohydrates, calories and sodium) on BMI and
      body composition at from baseline to each follow-up time point. We will control for age,
      sex, ethnicity, immunosuppressive medications and baseline body composition and BMI. IBM
      SPSS Statistics, version 21.0 will be used for the data analysis.
