  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of remotely delivered medical nutrition therapy
      (MNT), focused on increasing fruit/vegetable intake, and decreasing sodium and red/processed
      meat intake, in the treatment of patients with stage 1-2 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
      diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with diabetes and early CKD (stage 1-2) will be invited to participate in a
      prospective matched cohort study design to evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive remote
      dietary counseling program on kidney health. A total of 40 diabetic patients with early CKD
      and Geisinger Health Plan (GHP) insurance will be recruited for the intensive dietary
      modification, which will consist of having the patients complete a weekly telephone visit
      with the dietician as well as enter dietary information on the MyFitnessPal mobile app or
      website for a total of 8 weeks. To increase generalizability of this study, the
      investigators will recruit 20 patients with smartphone/internet access and 20 patients who
      have internet but no smartphone access. During the following year, patients will receive a
      bi-annual phone call to review participants progress. The need for further intensive weekly
      counseling will be assessed by the dietician and provided if indicated. Each intervention
      patient will be matched by demographics and comorbidities to 5 control patients with
      diabetes, early CKD and GHP insurance, who have previously been seen by a nutritionist at
      Geisinger. Control patients will receive no specific intervention.

      Aim 1 - The investigators will examine whether remotely delivered MNT can improve dietary
      quality over a 12-month period.

      Aim 2 - The investigators will compare rates of eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate)
      decline in study participants over a 3-year period, compared to a matched cohort who receive
      standard care.
