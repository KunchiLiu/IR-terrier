  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Saliva, blood, tissue, and cancer contain DNA. DNA makes the &quot;instruction book&quot; for the
      cells in the body. Cancer is caused by changes in DNA that affect cell function. Researchers
      want to test DNA of people with tumors. They want to look for genetic changes in tumors that
      could be targets for treatment. Because DNA can change as cancer changes, more testing may
      be done at different times.

      Objectives:

      To find the DNA changes in cancer that may help guide treatment. To collect samples and data
      to be used in future studies.

      Eligibility:

      People any age with cancer or a pre-cancerous tumor

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.
           Participants will give a sample of their tumor. This is usually from a previous
           procedure. Participants will give a saliva or blood sample. They cannot eat, drink,
           smoke, or chew gum for 30 minutes before giving saliva. They will spit about 1 teaspoon
           of saliva into a tube.

        -  Some participants may have a punch biopsy instead. A small instrument will take a small
           piece of skin.

        -  Researchers will collect data from participants medical records.

        -  Participants will answer questions about their family health history. They will also
           answer questions about their views on the study, including possible unexpected results.

        -  Extra blood or tissue samples may be taken at other times during the participants
           treatment. All samples will be saved in secure ClinOmics freezers to be used in future
           studies.

        -  Participants will be told by their doctors if any test results affect their health or
           their cancer treatment.

      Background:

        -  Laboratory-based investigations have contributed to an improved understanding of the
           biology of cancer and to the development of new therapies for malignancies.

        -  Omics Investigations leads to the identification of somatic or germline alterations
           that can enable precision therapy.

      Objectives:

      Primary

        -  Perform systematic molecular, genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic,
           metabolomics and other high throughput ( Omics ) profiling on tumor, malignancies of
           the blood or bone marrow, and normal tissues for the identification of biomarkers and
           targets for therapy.

        -  Identify incidental and secondary findings in germ line DNA for reporting clinical
           results into CRIS medical records from a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)
           certified lab.

        -  Identify actionable somatic mutations for reporting clinical results from a CLIA
           certified lab into CRIS medical records.

      Eligibility:

      Adult or Pediatric patients of any age with one of the following:

        -  Patient must be enrolled on an approved companion clinical trial within the NIH, Center
           for Cancer Research or approval from the ClinOmics protocol PI.

        -  Diagnosis of any tumor, malignancy, pre-malignant disorder, or suspected cancer
           susceptibility familial syndromes, regardless of patient age; OR

        -  Individuals without history of malignancy who are undergoing surgery; OR

        -  Individuals without a history of cancer but evidence of an inherited cancer syndrome
           based on family history and/or other manifestations of the syndrome (e.g. polyposis,
           plexiform neurofibromas, myelodysplastic syndrome); OR

        -  Tissue (including tumor, normal, blood, bone marrow, serum, plasma, or other tissues)
           that has been previously collected under CLIA and maintained in a CLIA lab which is
           available for CLIA analysis.

        -  Tissue (including tumor, normal, blood, bone marrow, serum, plasma, or other tissues)
           that has been previously collected and is available for research analysis.

        -  Biospecimens can be collected with minimal additional risk to the subject during
           sampling or procedures required for routine patient care.

           --For patients with a large tumor burden within the circulation for example with
           leukemia, skin biopsies may be performed on the companion protocol.

        -  Individual may be undergoing treatment for malignancy, premalignant condition or
           receiving other care associated with an inherited cancer syndrome.

        -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the
           willingness to sign a written informed consent OR

        -  IRB waiver of the requirement for informed consent for specific types of tissue

      Design:

      -This study will allow for the collection of specimens for CLIA reporting of germline and
      somatic mutations. The study will also collect specimens for a Tissue Repository, and for
      designated sample investigations including systematic molecular, genomic, epigenetic

      and proteomic (Omics) profiling, and growth factor and cellular profile investigations.

        -  CLIA testing activities will include

             -  DNA extracted from a section of tumor, malignant tissue or bone marrow samples for
                somatic mutation sequence analysis

             -  Germ line DNA extracted from lymphocytes, saliva, skin, or any normal uninvolved
                tissues for sequence analysis to identify somatic alterations in the cancer and
                for the reporting of incidental findings of established clinical validity and
                utility.

        -  Research activities may include:

             -  DNA, RNA and protein Omics analyses from extracted normal and/or tumor tissues;
                the remainder of the tumor tissue will be stored.

                tissue.
