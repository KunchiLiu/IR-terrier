      Study E7389-M044-504 is an observational, post-authorization, single-arm, prospective,
      multicenter cohort study conducted to characterize and determine the incidence of
      eribulin-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN), and the frequency and time to resolution of
      eribulin-induced PN in participants treated with eribulin in a real-life setting for locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer following one or two prior chemotherapeutic regimens
      for advanced disease.
