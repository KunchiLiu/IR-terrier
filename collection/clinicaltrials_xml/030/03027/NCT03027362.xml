    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are: 1) to investigate the efficacy of combining ketamine with
      intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to sustain the antidepressant effects of
      ketamine; and 2) to determine ketamine's delayed effects on learning and memory, and to
      explore the relationship between any ketamine-induced changes in learning and memory and
      duration of antidepressant efficacy, with and without CBT augmentation. Subjects with a
      diagnosis of MDD who are treatment-resistant to at least 2 antidepressants and have chosen
      to pursue clinical ketamine treatment at Yale Psychiatric Hospital will be recruited for the
      study.

    <description>Following clinical ketamine treatment, the intervention includes sixteen CBT sessions over 14 weeks. In addition, standard of care medications for treatment of depression, will be prescribed by the principal investigator or by a psychiatrist unaffiliated with the trial. Participants will remain on the medication they were prescribed when they entered the study and will be expected not to adjust the medication unless clinically urgent.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Suffering from a major depressive episode based on Diagnostic and Statistical manual
             (DSM) 5 criteria and having failed one or more standard antidepressant treatments
             during the current episode

          -  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17-HAM-D) score of 21 or more prior to ketamine
             treatment.

          -  Planned clinical treatment with ketamine at Yale Psychiatric Hospital (YPH)

          -  As the purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of CBT to
             sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine, only those who achieve a clinical
             response (i.e., 50% reduction in depression symptoms, as measured by the
             Montgomery-Asberg Depressive Rating Scale (MADRS) will be eligible for randomization.

          -  Patients must be treatment resistant to at least two drugs used to treat depression.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any Axis I or Axis II Disorder, which at screening is clinically predominant to their
             depressive episode or has been predominant to their depressive episode at any time
             within 6 months prior to screening

          -  Active suicidal thoughts with a plan

          -  Current or recent (&lt;6 months ago) substance use disorder

          -  Non-affective psychosis (such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder)

          -  Inability to speak English fluently

          -  A clinically significant abnormality on the screening physical examination that might
             affect safety, study participation, or confound interpretation of study results

          -  Dementia, delirium, or any other neurological or mental disease that might affect
             cognition or the ability to meaningfully participate in cognitive behavioral therapy
             (CBT).
