  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nurses participate to geriatric evaluations for falling patients. For these patients, it is
      recommended to evaluate,especially, visual acuity but this is not currently done because it
      is difficult to systematically combine with an ophthalmologic consultation.

      The HAS french recommendations propose to detect visual acuity deficiency using Monoyer and
      Parinaud scales, without specifying the professional qualification. According to the nurse
      competence decree of State Graduates, &quot;sensory disorders&quot; screening is a &quot;non-vulnerable&quot;
      examination, and can be performed by nurses. Therefore, they can use these scales, after
      training.

      We propose to evaluate the correlation between visual acuity scores obtained by nurses in
      geriatric consultations and an ophthalmologist.

      This study should include 204 patients over 65 years, who have fallen at least twice in the
      last 12 months. These patients will benefit from an evaluation by an ophthalmologist, after
      the geriatric consultation.
