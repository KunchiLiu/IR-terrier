        Intensive care unit (ICU) patients, who are mechanically ventilated via an artificial
        airway (endotracheal tube or tracheostomy cannula) and who are expected to be subjected to
        major changes in their ventilator settings will be monitored with the PulmoVista 500
        device before, during and after the changes. These changes in the ventilator settings
        should result in recognizable changes in the distribution of ventilation in the lungs.

        AND Patients who are scheduled for surgeries that require blocking of one bronchus

        Inclusion Criteria

        - The population included in the clinical study will be selected from a pool of patients
        undergoing respiratory support who are scheduled to have their ventilation settings
        changed.

        As a subgroup, patients who are scheduled for surgeries that need one-lung-ventilation
        (OLV) will be enrolled to the study.

          -  Male and female patients at the age of 18 years or older

          -  On respiratory support in ICU care or scheduled for such ( e.g. postoperatively) or
             scheduled for surgery with OLV

          -  Patients of which the monitoring of ventilation distribution may be of clinical
             interest

          -  Patients being ventilated via an artificial airway with a mechanical ventilator that
             is compatible with PulmoVista 500

          -  Patients scheduled for changes in ventilation settings that may cause relevant
             changes in the ventilation

          -  Chest circumference between 70 and 150 cm

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the study provided by either the patient
             or the legal representative of the patient.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Currently has a permanent or temporary pacemaker, implantable cardiac device (ICD) or
             other device emitting electrical energy

          -  a BMI ≥ 50

          -  tidal volume (VT) ≤ 200 mL

          -  Current uncontrolled body movements such as tics, tremors or seizures,

          -  Current wound dressings or infections on the chest that might interfere with the
             PulmoVista 500 electrode belt placement

          -  Women of child bearing potential whose pregnancy cannot be excluded based on a
             pregnancy test or other proven facts.

          -  Allergic to materials used in the electrode belt

          -  Participation of the patient in an interventional trial within the last four weeks
             before enrollment in this trial

          -  Evidence suggesting that the patient or his legal representative is not likely to
             follow the trial protocol (e.g. lacking compliance)

          -  Known infectious diseases that require isolation of patient (e.g. MRSA)

          -  Concomitant use of an air anti-decubitus medical mattress with dynamic inflation that
             cannot be deactivated during EIT measurements
