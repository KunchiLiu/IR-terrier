      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the safety of an active implantable
      (radiological) medical device OncoSil™, when implanted into patients with pancreatic cancer,
      who are already receiving standard chemotherapy. OncoSil™, is an experimental treatment.
      This means that it is not an approved treatment for pancreatic cancer anywhere in the world
      at this time.

      OncoSil™, carries the active treatment &quot;radioactive Phosphorous (32P)&quot; inside inactive
      silicon particles. These particles are tiny, and range in size from 28 to 32 micrometres,
      which is smaller than the width of a human hair (which typically range in width from 40 to
      120 micrometres). Once implanted, the OncoSil™, microparticles will stay in the tumour
      permanently.

      The purpose of OncoSil™, is to deliver the action of 32P directly into a targeted tumor to
      destroy cancer cells. The number of these tiny microparticles inserted into the target tumor
      will range from 120 thousand to 2 million, depending on the dose needed for the size of the
      tumor.

      Patients will be taking part in a single arm open label research study - which means that
      everyone in the research study will receive the investigational treatment OncoSil™, plus
      their prescribed standard chemotherapy regimen which will be either; Gemcitabine or
      gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane).

      Participation in this research study involves a Screening Period, a Treatment Follow Up
      Period and a Long Term follow up period. At the first screening visit, every patient will be
      asked to sign a consent form to agree to the study procedures, before any assessments are
      performed for the study.

      The Screening period will require attendance at 2 visits over a 2 week period, the Treatment
      Follow Up period will require attendance at assessment visits at the research study center;
      weekly for the first 12 weeks, the next visit will occur at week 16, then every 8 weeks
      after that until the End of Study (EOS) visit which will be scheduled once a patient's
      disease has progressed.

      The total number of visits patients will need to attend will depend on how long it takes for
      their disease to progress.

      The following assessments will be performed at all of the research study visits; Weight,
      current medications, , Quality of Life questionnaires, pain evaluation, Karnofsky
      performance status, blood sample, (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
      status, adverse events.

      The following assessments or procedures will take place at some of the study visits ( 1 or
      more): Informed consent, medical history, height, physical exam, Vital signs (blood
      pressure, heart rate, body temperature), tumor marker blood test, clotting factor blood
      test, pregnancy test, CT (computed tomography) scan - every 8 weeks, Bremsstrahlung Scan (2
      only) The implantation of OncoSil™ will be completed in the endoscopy suite of the hospital.
      Implantation will only occur once during the treatment period, and once implanted, the
      device cannot be removed.

      A procedure called endoscopic ultrasound will be used to implant the microparticles.
      Endoscopic ultrasound is a standard procedure performed by a trained doctor. An endoscopic
      ultrasound involves a long flexible, fibre optic tube being passed from the mouth, down the
      oesophagus (food tube or gullet) and close to the pancreas while the patient is sedated.
      This allows the specialist doctor to view the pancreas and enables them to implant the
      OncoSil microparticles via a fine needle directly into the target tumor. The implantation
      procedure will be recorded and photographs taken of the target tumor and inside the stomach.
      The recording and photographic images will be identified only by the patient's research
      study identification number.

      After the procedure, there will be a 4 hour observation period to ensure that the patient is
      feeling fine and safe to go home.

      After the patients target tumor shows progression on imaging, their will be an end of study
      visit and then the Long Term follow up period will be conducted. The Long Term Follow up
      does not require the patient to return to the research study site, it is done via telephone
      contact from the site with the patient or review of the patient's medical records by site
      staff every 8 weeks for a maximum of up to 30 months.

      Detailed Description

      Clinical Investigation Plan Rationale This clinical investigation will determine the safety
      and efficacy of the OncoSil™ investigational device when implanted directly into pancreatic
      tumors using endoscopic ultrasound guidance (EUS) in patients with unresectable locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC)1. OncoSil™ is a brachytherapy device that implants a
      pre-determined tumouricidal dose of the beta radiation emitting isotope (Phosphorus-32),
      directly into cancerous tissue. The implanted activity will be equivalent to an absorbed
      intended average dose of 100 Gray (100 Gy) (±20%). The dose of 100 Gy proposed in the
      present ONC01P03 study has been selected as it has shown to be safe and well tolerated in a
      previous pancreatic clinical trial DB2-201 that encompassed the largest pool of patients to
      date.

      OncoSil™ is a locally-directed therapy that is expected to be used in combination with
      systemic chemotherapy in this patient group in line with accepted clinical practice. The
      previous studies of OncoSil™ in pancreatic cancer were conducted with gemcitabine which at
      the time was standard of care, having been shown to be superior to 5- fluorouracil (5-FU).
      Recently, regimens consisting of combinations of agents have shown greater efficacy in
      advanced pancreatic cancer compared with gemcitabine alone. The combination of gemcitabine
      and nab-paclitaxel was superior to gemcitabine in a Phase III study, demonstrating a
      statistically significant survival advantage (median overall survival 8.5 vs 6.7 months;
      p&lt;0.001). This study was in patients with overt metastatic disease at presentation. This
      regimen has not been studied in prospective randomized controlled studies in LAPC. The
      regimen is being used in patients with good performance status (ECOG 0-1) and favourable
      co-morbidity profile and the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical
      Practice Guideline has recommended that it is reasonable to consider this combination in
      LAPC on the basis of extrapolation from the data obtained in the metastatic setting.
      Therefore this study aims to assess the safety of OncoSil™ when used in combination with a
      contemporary chemotherapy regimen.

      Given the patient specificity of chemotherapy administration it is not practical to
      standardize chemotherapy regimens across all patients.

      Gemcitabine and Gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel are chemotherapeutics, and as such are injected
      by infusion. These chemotherapeutics work to destroy fast dividing cells in an
      indiscriminate systemic fashion. OncoSil™ is a brachytherapy device that implants a
      pre-determined dose of beta radiation emitting isotope directly into cancerous tissue. The
      beta particles emitted by OncoSil™ travel a short distance in tissue causing direct damage
      to cancer cell DNA, which renders them incapable of further cell division and proliferation.
      Through this mechanism OncoSil™ is able to stop cancer cells from multiplying and ultimately
      shrink tumor masses when the cells eventually die. Therefore, the OncoSil™ device is
      intended for local treatment of cancerous pancreatic cells when it is implanted
      intratumourally.

      Following enrolment, safety will be measured by laboratory parameters once a week through to
      week 12, then 4 weeks later at week 16 and then every 8 weeks thereafter until the end of
      study (EOS) visit.

      Adverse events will be assessed throughout the duration of the study. Pain will be assessed
      via Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer Pancreatic Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ PAN-26). NRS will be
      assessed at each visit and EORTC QLQ PAN-26 will be assessed at screening and visit 1, then
      every 4 weeks until week 16, then 8 weekly until study participants reach documented
      progression of disease criteria for both local progression free survival (LPFS) and
      progression free survival (PFS).

      Response will be assessed by 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scanning every 8 weeks
      after visit 1. CT scans performed at 8 week intervals, is in line with standard radiological
      guidelines. Study participants will be managed by their local medical team according to
      clinical assessment based on clinical examination, tumor markers and radiological scans.

      Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Design: This will be a prospective, interventional, open
      label, single arm safety study with each site following a common protocol. Twenty study
      participants will be enrolled at up to 5 sites in the United States of America where
      recruitment will be competitive.

      Enrolment is estimated to take 6-12 months to complete. Each consented study participant is
      to be followed until documented progression of disease criteria is met for both LPFS and PFS
      (marking this as the end of the treatment follow-up period and EOS). From the EOS or
      discontinuation visit, 8 weekly medical record review will be used to monitor for possible
      device or late radiation related adverse events, and oncology treatments/procedures
      administered for up to 12 months post OncoSil™ implantation. Overall survival will also be
      conducted via the 8 weekly telephone contact and medical record reviews until study
      participant death, or until 104 weeks post the last study participant enrolled. No scheduled
      study participant study on-site visits are required for these follow-up reviews.

      All study participants will receive an OncoSil™ intratumoural implantation into a pancreatic
      tumor via injection under Endoscopic Ultrasound Guidance (EUS), at an average absorbed dose
      of 100Gy (±20%).

      Twenty study participants will receive OncoSil™ plus either Gemcitabine or
      Gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy treatment. The chemotherapy agents will be
      administered per local approved prescribing standards. Once 10 study participants have been
      enrolled all using one of the chemotherapy options (e.g. Gemcitabine), all remaining study
      participants needed to meet the study total of 20 must only be enrolled if they will be
      prescribed the remaining chemotherapy option (i.e. gemcitabine +nab-paclitaxel) A medical
      review of all safety events will occur regularly throughout the investigation.

      Treatment Design: The study has been chosen as open-label which is typical for oncology
      studies of this type, and reflects the fact that a sham endoscopy procedure poses a risk to
      study participants due to requiring sedation with no procedure performed.

      The order of OncoSil™ will be required to be made 28 calendar days before the implantation
      date. OncoSil™ implantation is to occur during the fourth (4th) week of the first
      chemotherapy cycle. For this to occur, the chemotherapy regimen must commence at a minimum
      of 7 and a maximum of 14 days post enrolment.

      Study Aim: To further investigate the safety of the active implantable (radiological)
      medical device, OncoSil™ when implanted intratumourally using EUS guidance in study
      participants with unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Study participants will
      receive either Gemcitabine or gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy plus OncoSil™. The
      following endpoints will be assessed Permissible Medications/Treatments Medication for
      supportive therapy and existing medical conditions is permitted as determined by the
      treating physician.

      Prohibited Medications/Treatments With exception of Gemcitabine and gemcitabine+
      nab-paclitaxel, any anti-cancer therapy including cytotoxic, biological/immunotherapy or
      radiotherapy is not permitted after the study participant has been screened and found
      eligible for the study, until the study participant reaches documented progression of
      disease criteria for both LPFS and PFS. Thereafter, study participants may be treated at the
      investigator's discretion. However, since the combination of standard radiotherapy and
      OncoSil™ has not been investigated, additional radiotherapy is not recommended following
      OncoSil™ treatment.

      Study participants should not receive any other investigational products (e.g. drugs,
      devices), or investigational therapies, during the study or within 30 days of screening or
      five half-lives of screening, whichever is longer.

      The investigator should instruct the study participant to notify the study site about any
      new medications (including over-the-counter products and herbal remedies) he/she takes after
      enrolment. All medications and significant non-drug therapies (including physical therapy
      and blood transfusions) administered after implantation with the study device must be
      documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF).

      Termination of the study:

      The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of the OncoSil Medical study physician and or
      SRC, study participants are placed at undue risk because of clinically significant findings
      that:

        -  Meet individual stopping criteria or are otherwise considered significant

        -  Are assessed as causally related to study device

        -  Are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study Regardless of the
           reason for termination, all data available for the study participant at the time of
           termination of follow-up must be recorded in the eCRF. All reasons for discontinuation
           of treatment must be documented. In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that
           adequate consideration is given to the protection of the study participants' interests.

      Visit schedule and assessments: Study visits will occur at Screening 1, Screening
      2/Enrolment, Day 0 and then at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, then 4 weeks
      later at week 16 then every 8 weeks until PD criteria is met for both LPFS and PFS. Study
      participants, who are discontinued for any reason, should be scheduled for an End of Study
      (EOS) visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the 'End of
      Study' visit will be performed.

      Study participants are to be seen for all visits on the designated day with an allowed visit
      window of ± 3 days for weeks 2 to 16 (visits 2 to 14), and a window of ± 7 days for CT scans
      and visits/reviews post 16 weeks (V14). The date of commencement of chemotherapy by default
      becomes Visit 1. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans are
      performed during the screening period and at week 12. There is ± 7 day window for
      performance of these scans. Bremsstrahlung Imaging will be performed at the Week 4 and Week
      5 visits.

      The following assessments may be performed at one, some or all of the study visits:

        -  Confirmation of written Informed Consent

      radiation related adverse events, and oncology treatments/procedures administered for up to
      12 months post OncoSil™ implantation.

      Overall survival will also be conducted via the 8 weekly medical record reviews until study
      participant death, or until 104 weeks post the last study participant enrolled.

      Gemcitabine or gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy will be dosed per standard of care
      (SoC) schedules concurrently with these visits.

      Females of child-bearing potential should use reliable methods of contraception from the
      time of screening and for 12 months after implantation of the study device.

      Male study participants should be asked to use barrier contraceptives (i.e., by use of
      condoms) during sex with all partners during the study and for a period of 12 months
      following the implantation of the study device.

      Device Description:

      OncoSil™, is comprised of OncoSil Phosphorous-32 Microparticles (hereafter Microparticles)
      and OncoSil Diluent (hereafter Diluent). OncoSil™ is an active implantable (radiological)
      medical device intended for use in brachytherapy, where cancer is treated by the insertion
      of radioactive implants directly into the cancerous tissue. OncoSil™ has been designed to be
      injected directly into, and to deliver an average absorbed dose of 100 Gy to the target
      treatment tumor. In therapeutic use 98% of the radiation is delivered within 81 days.
      OncoSil™ is supplied sterile and is intended for single-patient single-use.

      The Diluent has been designed to perform as a carrier to facilitate implantation of the
      Microparticles into the target treatment tumor. Prior to study participant administration,
      OncoSil™ is prepared by the treating facility's radio-pharmacist. The Microparticles and
      Diluent are combined in accordance with a pre-defined suspension preparation protocol. The
      resulting suspension has a pre-determined total activity required to deliver an average
      absorbed dose of 100 Gy to the target treatment tumor. Following preparation, the
      Microparticles are intratumourally implanted into a pancreatic tumor via injection under
      endoscopic ultrasound guidance.

      The Microparticles have been designed to deliver a localised distribution of beta radiation
      within the target treatment tumor and to remain there permanently following implantation.

      Note: OncoSil™ does not incorporate any material or ingredient derived from medicinal,
      human, animal or recombinant origin.

      Intended Use / Indications for Use

        -  OncoSil™ is intended for intratumoural implantation into a pancreatic tumor via
           injection under endoscopic ultrasound guidance.

        -  OncoSil™ is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced unresectable
           pancreatic cancer, in combination with standard of care chemotherapy.

      OncoSil Medical can only authorise a shipment of the OncoSil™ System to a site once:

        1. The license for the study centre to receive and hold 32P has been verified by OncoSil
           Medical.

        2. A training visit has been conducted in which relevant individuals permitted to work as
           an Authorised Dispenser (AD) and Authorised User (AU), investigators, study
           coordinators and surgical/procedural personnel etc. have completed the training and
           experience requirement set out by OncoSil Medical. In addition, the AD and AU must
           undergo additional training to obtain accreditation to handle, dispense and or implant
           OncoSil™.

           Authorised Dispenser (AD is the person preparing the OncoSil™ suspension (i.e.
           Radiopharmacist, Nuclear Medicine Personnel) and must successfully complete additional
           training on the OncoSil™ device as described below.

           Authorised Dispenser (AD): The AD attends the OncoSil Medical Training Programme and
           performs at least one cold dose (i.e. Microparticles are not radioactive) dilution
           which is supervised in the physical presence of an OncoSil Medical representative
           (Authorised Trainer). This training will be documented on the training log and a copy
           provided to OncoSil Medical.

           This training allows the Authorised Dispenser (AD) to:

             1. Order the OncoSil™ System calibration dose to perform a calibration procedure.

             2. Once the calibration dose has been successfully completed, the site will be able
                to order the OncoSil™ System study participant dose, to be used during the
                Authorised Users (AUs) supervised EUS implantation procedure of the first study
                participant at the respective study centre (refer to below) Authorised User (AU)

                  -  Definition of Authorised User (AU) is the physician physically depressing the
                     syringe containing OncoSil™ during the implantation procedure and must have
                     successfully completed additional training on the OncoSil™ device as outlined
                     below:

                  -  Authorised User (AU): In order to become a fully accredited Authorised User,
                     the AU attends the OncoSil Medical Training Programme and must perform their
                     first study participant implantation in the physical presence of an OncoSil
                     Medical representative (Authorised Trainer).

           Once the completed training log has been provided to OncoSil Medical, the AD and AU
           will each receive an accreditation certificate to document that they are authorised to
           order and handle the OncoSil™ System.

           Note: In some cases the AD and the AU may be the same person, however, they will be
           required to complete both training programmes in order to be accredited in both roles.

           All personnel must be trained by OncoSil Medical, or an Authorised Representative.
           Supplemental training may be required if significant revisions are made to existing
           procedures by the company. Upon site activation, once a study participant has been
           deemed eligible by a study investigator and enrolled into the study, the investigator
           will notify the Authorised Dispenser (Nuclear Medicine Personnel/ Radio-pharmacist) for
           device ordering.

           An order of the OncoSil™ System is then placed with OncoSil Medical, and the study
           participant is booked in for an EUS procedure (allowing 28 calendar days from time of
           order to receipt of the OncoSil™ System).

           Implantation Strategy for OncoSil™ The pancreatic target tumor volume will be
           determined from the screening/baseline CT scan i.e. the last measurement taken prior to
           implantation that meets the requirements of the protocol.

           The target tumor volume will be measured independently by the CRC who will provide an
           Adobe pdf file of the baseline target tumor volume to the Principal Investigator. This
           document must be stored in the study participant file.

           The baseline target tumor volume will be used to determine the OncoSil™ Volume to be
           Implanted (VTBI).

           A single dose is implanted into the body of the tumor using the final suspension of
           OncoSil™ with a radioactive concentration of 6.6 megabecquerel (MBq) per mL (the
           radioactivity concentration required, with an Implanted Volume/Tumor Volume (IV/TV) of
           8%, to deliver 100 Gy to the tumor mass).

           Implantation of OncoSil™ is performed using a disposable 22 gauge EUS-fine needle
           aspiration (FNA) needle, loaded through the biopsy channel of the echoendoscope and
           slowly advanced through the gastric wall or duodenal wall into the target pancreatic
           tumor (avoiding vessels and avoiding damage to surrounding organs) using ultrasound
           guidance.

           The position of the needle tip within a tumor will be identified by endoscopic
           ultrasound localisation prior to injection. In this way the Endoscopist will need to
           determine that the needle is placed intratumourally. The required amount of OncoSil™ is
           then implanted within the tumor by the Authorised User.

           Radiological Dose Administered:

           An assessment has been conducted of the absorbed dose measured in Gray, (the average
           radiation energy imparted to a medium, where 1 Gy = 1 J/kg) that is likely to be
           administered during implantation into a tumor in the pancreas.

           The average absorbed dose that any treated tumor will receive is 100Gy (±20%). Only one
           tumor will be treated per study participant.

           Treatable tumors will be between ≥ 2.0 cm in the shortest diameter and ≤ 6 cm in the
           longest diameter and a minimum tumor volume of 14.0 cc as assessed by the CRC.

           Decay/Disposal of Study Device and Components Supplies During the study, all used /
           remaining investigational devices must be decayed and/or destroyed at the treatment
           facility that received the study device shipment and in accordance with local
           regulations. A device deficiency of the OncoSil™ System should be notified to OncoSil
           Medical or designee. Written instructions provided by OncoSil Medical should be
           followed when reporting a device deficiency of the OncoSil™ System.

           Post OncoSil™ Implant Study participant Observation Following implantation, it is
           recommended that study participants are observed for four hours (with regular
           observations of consciousness and vital signs as clinically indicated) and if stable
           and pain-free they can be discharged the same day. An overnight stay is optional and is
           at the discretion of the investigator.

           Evaluation and Documentation of Adverse Events (AE) and Device Deficiencies
           Investigators are required to evaluate and document all AEs and Device Deficiencies
           observed in study participants.

           To ensure study participant safety, every AE, (regardless of suspected causality),
           occurring during the following periods outlined below must be reported to OncoSil
           Medical from learning of its occurrence.

           From the date of signed informed consent until the study participant has stopped study
           participation and must also be followed for no shorter period than:

             -  28 days post last chemotherapy administered

             -  120 days post OncoSil™ implantation

           For all observed or reported AEs, investigators should assess and document the details
           in the study participant's medical records/source documents. The general procedure for
           investigators reporting any adverse event is as follows:

             -  Report the event via the eCRF system as soon as possible but no later than the
                timeframes outlined in the International Standard Good Clinical Practice
                (ISO14155:2011) guidelines.

             -  Complete all sections of the Adverse Event eCRF

             -  Each unique event/diagnosis must be documented separately

             -  Documented pre-existing conditions are not considered to be reportable AEs unless
                there is a change in the nature or severity of the condition

             -  The Adverse Event information must be documented in the study participant's source
                documents, reviewed and approved by the Investigator.

           The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will comprise of Medical and Radiation Oncologists,
           Nuclear Medicine Physician, the OncoSil Chief Medical Officer, and the Coordinating
           Principal Investigator for the study. Additional ad hoc members may be invited to
           participate in meetings depending on the safety findings and required scope of
           expertise. The SRC will meet to review the safety profile of the study (all adverse
           events) on an on-going basis. Particular Attention will be paid to potential
           sub-acute/late effects of radiation, such as gastrointestinal haemorrhages, bowel
           ulceration, enteritis, perforations, fistula and stricture that could occur.

           The SRC will meet initially, after the first five (5) study participants have been
           implanted with OncoSil™ and also once these study participants have completed the first
           eight (8) weeks of follow-up post implant. The SRC will continue to meet to review the
           safety profile of the study after every additional five (5) study participants have
           been implanted with OncoSil™ until enrolment has completed. Then the committee will
           subsequently meet every four (4) months until the completion of all study participants
           follow up.

           Any one of the following conditions will pause the study.

             -  One implant with missed target tumor (determined by Bremsstrahlung imaging)

             -  A subject with evidence of radioactivity in the blood &gt;1% of the activity of the
                injected dose at any time point

             -  One Serious Adverse Device Effect, requiring hospitalisation

             -  A study participant death (related to the device) within 4 weeks of OncoSil™
                implant The results and recommendations of the SRC will be minuted. The
                composition and activities of the committee are described within the SRC charter
                and Safety Management Plan - which are separate documents.

           Risks associated with OncoSil™ and or implantation procedure

           The following adverse events, considered to have a causal relationship with OncoSil™ or
           procedure, were recorded during previous clinical studies:

             -  Procedure-related pain

             -  Abdominal pain and discomfort

             -  Lethargy

             -  Fever

             -  Nausea and vomiting

             -  Abnormal liver function tests There may also be unforeseen risks to the study
                participant, embryo or fetus if the study participant fathers a child, or becomes
                pregnant. The study participant should not father a child, become pregnant, or
                breast-feed a baby within twelve months of receiving an implantation. In addition,
                an effective, hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence method of
                birth control must be used post-implantation for the entire duration of the study
                (and for not less than twelve months after implantation).

           Although not experienced by any of the patients previously dosed with OncoSil™, there
           are potential sub-acute/late effects of radiation, such as gastrointestinal
           haemorrhages, bowel ulceration, enteritis, perforations, fistula and stricture that
           could occur.

           All risks individually and cumulatively, considered versus the benefit, have been taken
           into account. Residual risks are low and acceptable when balanced against the clinical
           benefit associated with use of the device. The overall risk assessment for OncoSil™ has
           therefore been assessed as being acceptable.

           In addition to the risks listed in the above section, there may be further risks to the
           study participants, the nature of which are unknown.

           STATISTICAL ANALYSES Populations for Analysis The intention-to-treat (ITT) population
           will consist of all enrolled study participants.

           The Safety population will consist of all study participants who received an
           implantation of OncoSil™.

           Study participant Demographics/Other Baseline Characteristics All study participants'
           demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarised descriptively for the
           ITT and Safety populations.

           Overall Survival An analysis of overall survival will be conducted once 52 weeks post
           the last possible enrolled study participant has completed and then a final analysis
           104 weeks post the last possible enrolled study participant. Because these analyses are
           not pivotal there will be no adjustment to p-values for the multiple tests.

           Statistics Methods The demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarised as
           mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum for continuous variables, and as
           frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.

           The time to event efficacy variables such as local progression free survival (LPFS),
           will be summarized as sample size, number of events, median time to the event, and 95%
           confidence interval for the median. The distribution of each time to event variable
           will be estimated for each treatment with the Kaplan-Meier curve.

           Training of Study Site Personnel The clinical investigation shall not commence until
           the required approval/s are obtained. With written acknowledgement from OncoSil
           Medical, any additional requirements imposed by a local Ethics Committee and/or
           Regulatory Authority shall be followed.

           Only Investigators/Co-Investigators, named on the study delegation log, trained by the
           sponsor or delegate, and who meet local licensing requirements will perform the
           implantation procedure. OncoSil™ will be prepared by designated personnel licensed to
           handle radioactive products and who have completed the OncoSil Medical Training. All
           site investigation personnel will receive and document training prior to commencing
           participation in the investigation.

           Before the first study participant is entered into the study, an OncoSil Medical
           representative will review and discuss the requirements of the Clinical Investigation
           Plan and related documents with the investigational staff and also train them in any
           study specific procedures and the eCRF system utilised.

           The Principal Investigator will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study
           is given to all of these staff, and that any new information relevant to the
           performance of this study is provided to and reviewed by, the staff involved.

           Ethical Considerations It is mandatory that all considerations regarding the protection
           of human study participants be carried out in accordance with the CIP, Good Clinical
           Practices (GCP), ISO14155: 2011, the ethical principles that have their origin in the
           Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Before enrolment
           of any study participant into the study, the final study protocol, including the final
           version of the Informed Consent Form, is approved by the national regulatory authority
           or a notification to the national regulatory authority is done, according to local
           regulations.

           Informed Consent and Study participant Information Obtaining informed consent must be
           done according to the guidelines provided in the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO14155, and
           local regulations.

           OncoSil Medical Ltd will provide to Investigators an informed consent form that
           complies with the ISO14155 guidelines and regulatory requirements and is considered
           appropriate for this study.

           The Principal Investigator (according to applicable regulatory requirements) or a
           person designated by the Principal Investigator and under the Investigator's
           responsibility must comply with the terms of the informed consent process and must
           fully inform study participants of all pertinent aspects of the clinical study.

           Patient Confidentiality A report of the results of this study may be published or sent
           to the appropriate health authorities in any country in which the study device may
           ultimately be marketed, but the study participant's name will not be disclosed in these
           documents. The study participant's name may be disclosed to the Sponsor of the study,
           OncoSil Medical, or the governing health authorities or the regulatory authorities if
           they inspect the study records. Appropriate precautions will be taken to maintain
           confidentiality of medical records and personal information.
