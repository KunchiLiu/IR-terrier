  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label, multi-center, intra-patient dose escalation study to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics after oral administration of eltrombopag in combination
      with immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric patients with previously untreated or
      relapsed/refractory severe aplastic anemia or recurrent aplastic anemia.

      All patients will be treated with eltrombopag for the 26-week Treatment Period, followed by
      a 52-week Follow-Up Period. Patients who have been previously untreated with
      immunosuppressive therapy will be treated according to the standard of care,
      hATG/cyclosporine, in addition to eltrombopag. Patients with relapsed/refractory SAA or
      recurrent AA will be enrolled into one of two treatment options: hATG/cyclosporine plus
      eltrombopag or cyclosporine plus eltrombopag, depending on prior treatment with
      immunosuppressive therapy.

      After initiating treatment with eltrombopag, patients will have their dose assessed and
      modified as tolerated, until the targeted platelet count or maximum dose is achieved.
      Pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed at time points intended to capture steady
      state PK of the starting dose and highest dose achieved.

      Upon completion of the Treatment and Follow-Up Periods, all patients will be offered the
      opportunity to enroll in an additional 3 year Long Term Follow-Up Period.
