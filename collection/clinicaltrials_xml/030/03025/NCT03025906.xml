  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is a life-threatening emergency,
      evidence-based data to guide initial drug treatment choices are lacking in the Chinese
      population. The investigators conducted this prospective randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) phenobarbital (PB) and
      valproate (VPA) in patients with GCSE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the failure of first-line diazepam treatment, patients with GCSE were randomized to
      receive either IV PB (standard doses, low rate) or VPA (standard). Successful treatment was
      considered when clinical and electroencephalographic seizure activity ceased. Adverse events
      following treatment and the neurological outcomes at discharge and 3 months later were also
      evaluated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with effective seizure control</measure>
    <time_frame>Twenty minutes after the end of the PB or VPA loading dose</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study endpoint is the number of patients with effective seizure control, defined as a cessation of clinical and electroencephalographic seizure activity within 20 min after administration of the phenobarbital or valproate loading dose. Effective control of GCSE is assessed clinically by one certified neurologist and also confirmed with EEG by one certified electroencephalographer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mortality of patients</measure>
    <time_frame>at 30 days and at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurologic outcome is assessed both at 30 days and at 3 months by one physician unaware of the therapeutic assignment through a phone interview or scheduled follow-up clinic visit. Mortality of each group is recorded at 30 days and at 3 months, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with post-SE symptomatic epilepsy</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Post-SE symptomatic epilepsy at 3 months is analyzed. It is defined as the occurrence of at least one unprovoked epileptic seizure occurring not earlier than 4 weeks after termination of SE in those without pre-existing epilepsy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The relapse rates of SE and nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) / nonconvulsive seizures (NCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>in the first 24 h</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators also record the relapse rates of SE and nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) / nonconvulsive seizures (NCS) in each group in the first 24 h.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the administration of PB or VPA to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events are recorded as follows: systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg, pulse lower than 50 beats/ min, arrhythmia (except supraventricular tachycardia), respiratory depression (arterial oxygen saturation below 90%, partial pressure of oxygen below 60 mmHg, or partial pressure of carbon dioxide above 60 mmHg), drug-induced liver disease (alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin increase of more than twice the upper limit of the normal range), elevation of blood ammonia (more than twice the upper limit of the normal range), gastric motility insufficiency, bone marrow suppression (leukocytopenia, neutrocytopenia, thrombocytopenia or anemia), coagulation disorders, or drug-related sedation. The time to record adverse events is from the administration of PB or VPA to 1 week.</description>
