  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every patient included in the study will undergo 3 standardised hemodialysis treatments,
      each using a different dialysis membrane (PMMA, PS, AN69ST). The order of the membranes used
      will be randomized.

      During each conventional and standardised hemodialysis treatment, 6 blood samples will be
      taken at different time points (T0, T5, T15, T30, T90, T240) to evaluate coagulation
      activation (TAT, PF1+2, d-dimers, TF) and, more specifically, activation of the contact
      phase pathway of coagulation (kallikrein, fXIa, fXIIa).
