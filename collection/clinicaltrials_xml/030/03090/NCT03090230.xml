      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the RelayPro
      Thoracic Stent-Grafts in subjects with traumatic injury of the descending thoracic aorta
      (DTA)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-blinded, non-randomized study of the RelayPro
      Thoracic Stent-Graft in subjects with traumatic injury of the DTA in subjects who are
      candidates for endovascular repair.The primary objective of the study is all-cause mortality
      at 30 days post procedure.

      The secondary objectives of the trial will include descriptive analyses of procedural and
      post-procedural observations through 5 years of follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years.

          2. Subject must have a traumatic injury of the descending thoracic aorta that occurred
             no more than 30 days prior to the planned stent implant procedure.

          3. Proximal and distal landing zones with diameter between 19 mm and 42 mm.

          4. Subject must have a proximal attachment zone distal to the left common carotid and a
             distal attachment zone proximal to the origin of the celiac artery.

          5. The length of the attachment zones will depend on the intended stent graft diameter.

             a. The proximal attachment zone should be: i. 15 mm for 22 - 28 mm grafts with bare
             stent (20 mm for RelayPro grafts with non-bare stent).

        ii. 20 mm for 30 - 46 mm grafts with bare stent (25 mm for RelayPro grafts with non-bare
        stent).

        b. The distal attachment zone should be 20 mm for all Relay Pro grafts. Coverage of the
        left subclavian artery is permitted. Revascularization of the left subclavian artery may
        be considered in all cases by the treating physician and, especially, in anatomies where
        revascularization is determined to be clinically necessary 7. Proximal and distal
        attachment zones containing a straight segment (non-tapered, non-reverse tapered, defined
        by &lt;10% diameter change) with lengths equal to or greater than the required attachment
        length for the intended device. 8. Adequate iliac or femoral artery access for
        introduction of the RelayPro delivery system.

        Alternative methods to gain proper access may be utilized (e.g., iliac conduit).

        9. Subject willing to comply with the follow-up evaluation schedule. 10. Subject (or
        Legally Authorized Representative, LAR) agrees to sign an Informed Consent Form prior to
        treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Significant stenosis, calcification, thrombus, or tortuosity of intended fixation sites
        that would compromise fixation or seal of the device. 2. Planned coverage of left carotid
        or celiac arteries; or anatomic variants that may compromise circulation to the carotid,
        vertebral, or innominate arteries after device placement, and are not amenable to
        subclavian revascularization. 3. Prior endovascular or surgical repair in the DTA. The
        device may not be placed within any prior endovascular or surgical graft. 4. Concomitant
        aneurysm/disease of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, or abdominal, aorta requiring
        repair. 5. Prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (endovascular or surgical) that was
        performed less than 6 months prior to the planned stent implant procedure. 6. Untreatable
        allergy or sensitivity to contrast media or device components. 7. Known or suspected
        connective tissue disorder.

          -  8. Blood coagulation disorder or bleeding diathesis for which the treatment cannot be
             suspended for one week pre- and/or post-repair. 9. Coronary artery disease with
             unstable angina. 10. Severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association
             functional class IV).

             11. Stroke and/or Myocardial Infarction within 3 months of the planned treatment
             date.

             12. Pulmonary disease requiring the routine (daily or nightly) need for oxygen
             therapy outside the hospital setting. 13. Acute renal failure or chronic renal
             insufficiency, and not receiving dialysis.

             14. Hemodynamically unstable. 15. Active systemic infection and/or mycotic aneurysms.
             16. Morbid obesity or other condition that may compromise or prevent the necessary
             imaging requirements. 17. Injury Severity Score of 75. 18. Less than two-year life
             expectancy. 19. Current or planned participation in an investigational drug or device
             study that has not completed primary endpoint evaluation. 20. Currently pregnant or
             planning to become pregnant during the course of the study.

             21. Medical, social, or psychological issues that Investigator believes may interfere
             with treatment or follow-up.
