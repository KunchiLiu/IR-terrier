    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, multicenter research in
      order to evaluate the effect of Shuxuetong injection in prevention of symptomatic or
      asymptomatic new cerebral infarction within 10 days.

      Subgroup study：Evaluate the role of advanced diagnostic technique in identifying potential
      causes of Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (ESUS).
