      The purpose of this study is to establish the incidence of sub-optimal response to anti-TNF
      therapy in UC and CD participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with historical diagnosis of CD and UC who were na√Øve to anti-TNF therapy were
      observed in this retrospective study. The study will look to identify the local barriers in
      prescribing anti-TNF therapy, treatment patterns and indicators of sub-optimal response to
      anti-TNF therapy in UC and CD participants in real-world clinical practice in the EM
      countries, along with the associated incidence of sub-optimal response and impact on health
      care resource utilization (HCRU). The will enroll approximately 2000 participants.

      The study consists of two periods, eligibility period followed by a data abstraction period.
      During the eligibility period participants who had initiated first anti-TNF therapy during
      01 March 2010 up to 01 March 2015 will be recruited and observed. Participants will be
      followed up for a period of minimum 2 years (other than death) and a maximum of 5 years from
      the date of first treatment of anti-TNF therapy for CD and UC (Index date). During the data
      abstraction period participants who have eligible medical charts will be identified and all
      retrospective data will be collected.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Argentina, China, Colombia, Mexico, Russia,
      Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. The overall time to abstract data
      during the data extraction period from the web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system
      will be approximately 1 year from March 2017 to February 2018.

    <measure>Number of Participants With CD Achieving Clinical Response Based on Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a decrease in HBI score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3 points from baseline. HBI score is used to measure the disease activity of CD. It consists of clinical parameters: abdominal pain (0-3, higher score means more severe pain), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0-3, where higher score means presence of swelling in the abdomen), and complications (score 1 per item). Total score is the sum of individual parameters. The score ranges from a minimum score of 0 to no pre-specified maximum score as it depends on the number of liquid stools, where higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With UC Achieving Clinical Response Based on Mayo Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a decrease in the partial Mayo Score of at least 2 points and &gt;=25% from baseline, with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of &gt;=1 point from baseline or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1 point. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consists of 3 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician global assessment of disease severity, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9; where higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
