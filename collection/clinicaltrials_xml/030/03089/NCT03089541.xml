  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This one-year pilot study of 30 non-treatment seeking young adult e-cigarette/cigarette dual
      users (15 males/15 females) will use smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA)
      to gather real-time data of e-cigarette and cigarette behaviors during a 1-week
      cigarette/e-cigarette dual use period and a 2-week exclusive e-cigarette use period.
      Exclusive e- cigarette use will be promoted with contingency management (CM) procedures.(1)
      Participants will respond to daily random prompts assessing in-the-moment use of
      e-cigarettes/cigarettes and the subjective factors (ratings of satisfaction and withdrawal)
      and contextual factors (location, activity, social cues) associated with each episode of
      use. Participants will also complete daily electronic diaries to document e-cigarette use
      episodes/day, and satisfaction with the e-cigarette experience during the study.
