      Objectives:

      Primary Objective

      Explore association between intensity of C11-AMT PET at baseline, as measured by mean
      standardized uptake value (SUVmax at each lesion), total tumor metabolic volume, measurement
      of intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity), with objective response rate (ORR) at 12
      weeks (as defined via RECIST1.1) to pembrolizumab in patients with treatment-naïve
      metastatic melanoma.

      Secondary Objectives

      Estimate ORR (Complete Response + Partial Response) by RECIST 1.1 at 12 weeks to
      pembrolizumab in patients with treatment-naïve metastatic melanoma.

      Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with
      pembrolizumab as front-line therapy.

      Explore associations in SUVmax, and other PET parameters (e.g. total tumor metabolic volume,
      measurement of intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity), using C11-AMT PET
      co-registered with CT with no contrast and 18F-FDG-PET at baseline.

      Explore associations between SUVmax, and other PET parameters (e.g. total tumor metabolic
      volume, measurement of intra-tumoral and inter-lesional heterogeneity), from C11-AMT PET
      imaging at baseline with expression of components of the IDO pathway detected by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence such as LAT1, IDO, TPH1, lymphocyte
      subtypes (CD4, CD8, FoxP3, MDSC), PD-1/PD-L1, and other immune checkpoint pathways (LAG3,
      GITR, TIM3) in freshly acquired tumor specimens prior to treatment with pembrolizumab.

      Assess metabolic changes at week 12 following treatment with pembrolizumab using baseline
      and week 12 18F-FDG PET.

      Outline:

      Screening:

      Whole body FDG PET/CT scan with IV contrast will be performed at least 24 hours before
      C11-AMT PET scanning, as per standard of care. C11-AMT PET will be performed at least 24
      hours before pembrolizumab treatment and at least 24 hours after FDG PET/CT scan.

      After screening and enrollment, treatment will consist of the following:

      Pembrolizumab 200mg IV flat dose will be administered over 30 minutes on Day 1;
      Pembrolizumab dosing will be repeated every 3 weeks until progression or subject withdrawal
      for other reasons.

      At the end of treatment:

      Whole body FDG PET/CT scan with IV contrast.

      Projected Accrual:

      Up to 25 subjects who have not received prior therapy for their recent diagnosis of distant
      melanoma.

             months have elapsed between the last dose and treatment initiation as part of this
             study. Prior radiation therapy for metastatic melanoma is allowed as long as the
             patient bears measurable actively growing disease outside the previously irradiated
             field. NOTE: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately
             from the toxicity (i.e., all symptoms ≤ grade 1) and/or complications from the
             intervention prior to starting therapy.

               -  History of malignancy provided patient has completed therapy and is free of
                  disease for ≥ 2 years. If patient had other malignancy within the last 2 years
                  from which he may have been completely cured by surgery alone, he may considered
                  to be enrolled on condition that the risk of development of distant metastatic

             metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.
             This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded
             regardless of clinical stability.

          9. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
             years (i.e. with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or

             interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
