      A Phase 3b, single arm, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and to
      demonstrate the non-inferiority of the sustained virologic response 12 weeks post dosing
      (SVR12) rates of 8 weeks of treatment with the glecaprevir (GLE)/pibrentasvir (PIB)
      combination regimen to the historical SVR12 rate of 12 weeks of treatment with the GLE/PIB
      in treatment-naïve adults with chronic HCV GT 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection and compensated
      cirrhosis.

    <description>Post-treatment relapse was defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ between the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug among participants with HCV RNA levels &lt; LLOQ at the end of treatment, excluding participants who have been shown to be re-infected.</description>
