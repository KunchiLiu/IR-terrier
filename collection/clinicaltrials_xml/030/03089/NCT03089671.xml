  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The risk of ureteric injury at the time of pelvic reconstructive surgery can be
      as high as 3% and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has stated that
      intraoperative cystoscopy should be done after all such procedures. Intravenous indigo
      carmine was routinely given during surgery to colour the urine bright blue and allow for
      assessment of ureteric integrity. In 2014, indigo carmine was no longer available worldwide
      and since then, surgeons have been searching for suitable alternatives. Vitamin B is a water
      soluble vitamin that colours the urine bright yellow and can be given immediately before
      surgery to help with ureteric visualization. Alternatively, 5% dextrose in water (D5W) can
      be used as the instillation fluid during cystoscopy to allow for urine jet visualization due
      to the difference in fluid viscosity. Both agents have been shown to be better than
      instillation with normal saline and are affordable and accessible in Canada.

      Objective: To identify which agent is superior for intraoperative ureteric visualization at
      the time of cystoscopy by determining the difference in detection rate of both ureteric jets
      using either preoperative oral vitamin B or intraoperative cystoscopic distension with D5W.

      Methods: This study will be a three-site (Mount Sinai Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences
      Centre, St. Michael's Hospital), double-blinded, randomized control trial whereby female
      patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery will be randomized to receive either
      preoperative vitamin B or intraoperative D5W cystoscopic instillation fluid. Parameters
      measured during surgery will include whether both ureteric jets were seen, time to
      visualization of both ureters, colour of jets, and surgeon satisfaction. Patients will also
      be seen at one week after surgery to assess for urinary tract infection. Sample size
      calculation based on previous studies demonstrated a need for 125 patients per study arm.

      Anticipated Clinical Significance: The findings of this study will be relevant to all
      surgeons performing intraoperative cystoscopy where ureteric visualization is required. The
      investigators believe the outcome of this study will help make cystoscopy shorter and more
      efficient for surgeons who often feel the pressure of time constraints within the operating
      room setting. In turn, decreasing the time of cystoscopy may reduce operating times which
      will benefit both the patient and hospital.

    <masking_description>Patient packages will be created and assigned a patient number. For those randomized to the vitamin B group, the package will consist of a pill of vitamin B2 that is inside an opaque gelatin capsule that is matched to a litre bag of normal saline that is wrapped in an opaque covering. For those randomized to the D5W group, the package will consist of a pill that is an empty opaque gelatin capsule that is matched to a litre bag of D5W that is wrapped in an opaque covering. These packages will be coupled with the patient according to her randomization group in the preoperative area.
In the preoperative area, all patients will be given the pill in their package by mouth 60 to 120 minutes before the start of surgery. The covered bag will then accompany the patient to the operating room and will be set up as the instillation fluid for cystoscopy. This way, the patient and operating team will be blinded to what agent was used for ureteric visualization.</masking_description>
