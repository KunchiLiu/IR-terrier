    <description>Comparing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response rates between AV Delay programming schemes defined by SmartDelay or a Fixed AV Delay of 120ms. CRT response is defined by a decrease in Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume (LVESV) ≥ 15% at 6 months compared to pre-implant baseline.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be indicated to receive a de novo quadripolar Boston Scientific Cardiac
             Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator (CRT-D) in conjunction with an ACUITY X4 LV
             lead. This includes subjects who are indicated to receive an upgrade to a BSC X4
             CRT-D from a previously implanted device.

          -  In order to achieve a homogenous population for the study, qualifying subjects are
             those with heart failure who meet BSC US indications for use defined as those
             subjects who receive stable optimal pharmacologic therapy (OPT) for heart failure and
             who meet any one of the following classifications:

               -  Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA Class III-IV) with EF ≤ 35% and QRS
                  duration ≥ 120 ms

               -  Left bundle branch block (LBBB) with QRS duration ≥ 130 ms, EF ≤ 30%, and mild
                  (NYHA Class II) ischemic or nonischemic heart failure or asymptomatic (NYHA
                  Class I) ischemic heart failure

          -  Subject is age 18 or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to each
             country and national laws

          -  Subject is willing and capable of providing informed consent

          -  Subject is willing and capable of complying with visits and procedures as defined by
             this protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with documented permanent complete AV block

          -  Subjects with permanent or chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) or in AF at the time of
             enrollment

          -  Subjects who have previously received cardiac resynchronization therapy with pacing
             in the left ventricle

          -  Subjects on the active heart transplant list or who has or is to receive ventricular
             assist device (VAD)

          -  Life expectancy shorter than 12 months due to any medical condition (e.g., cancer,
             uremia, liver failure, etc…)

          -  Subject with a known or suspected sensitivity to dexamethasone acetate (DXA)

          -  Subject is enrolled in any other concurrent clinical study, with the exception of
             local mandatory governmental registries and observational studies/registries, without
             the written approval from Boston Scientific

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are or plan to become pregnant during the course
             of the trial

          -  Subjects currently requiring dialysis
