      To estimate the effect on carriage, approximately 60,000 year 10, 11, and 12 students will
      be offered 4CMenB vaccination in South Australia through schools over the study period with
      50% receiving the vaccine in 2017 and 50% in 2018. In year 10 and 11 students, posterior
      pharyngeal swabs will be obtained at baseline and 12 months post baseline to estimate the
      difference in carriage prevalence of all serogroups of N. meningitidis and serogroup B
      between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants.

    <textblock>
      This cluster randomised controlled study will be conducted in the context of funded 4CMenB
      vaccine offered to all students in years 10, 11, and 12.

      Year 10 and 11 students will undergo baseline and 12 months posterior pharyngeal swabs. Year
      12 students will undergo baseline posterior pharyngeal swabs only.

      Randomisation will take place at the school level and will be stratified by school size
      ((&lt;60, 60 to 119, and ≥120 students per year level) and school socio-economic status (SES),
      as measured by the Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA); (ICSEA &lt;970, 970
      to 1020, &gt;1020) For the purposes of the study a school is defined as an educational
      institution at which students in years 10, 11, 12 physically attend school during the week.
      All 260 schools in metropolitan and rural SA will be approached to participate in the study.
      All schools agreeing to participate will be randomised to 4CMenB vaccine in 2017 or 2018.
      Students at schools randomised to receive the vaccine at baseline will receive the 4CMenB
      vaccine in 2017. Students at schools randomised to receive the vaccine at the 12 month
      posterior pharyngeal swab will receive the 4CMenB vaccine in 2018.

      Primary Objectives

      • Estimate the difference in all serogroups of N. meningitidis carriage prevalence following
      the 12 month pharyngeal swab in year 10 and 11 students who received two doses of Bexsero®,
      compared to unvaccinated students.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Estimate the difference in each N. meningitidis serogroup (A, B, C, W, Y) carriage
           prevalence following the 12 month pharyngeal swab in year 10 and 11 students who
           received two doses of Bexsero ®, compared to unvaccinated students.

        -  Estimate the change in all serogroups of N. meningitidis carriage prevalence over a 12
           month period in year 10 and 11 students who received two doses of Bexsero ®, compared
           to unvaccinated students (baseline vs 12 month swabs).

        -  Estimate the change in each N. meningitidis serogroup (A, B, C, W, Y) carriage
           prevalence over a 12 month period in students who received two doses of Bexsero ®,
           compared to unvaccinated students (baseline vs 12 month swabs).

             -  Difference in the acquisition of each N. meningitidis serogroup at 12 months,
                defined as negative at baseline and positive at 12 months for N. meningitidis.

             -  Difference in persistent carriage of each N. meningitidis serogroup at 12 months,
                defined as positive at both baseline and 12 months for N. meningitidis.

             -  Difference in clearance of carriage of each N. meningitidis serogroup at 12
                months, defined as positive at baseline and negative at 12 months for N.
                meningitidis.

        -  Determine the difference in density as measured by qPCR of N. meningitides (all
           serogroups) in vaccinated versus unvaccinated students.

        -  Identify characteristics associated with carriage prevalence of N. meningitidis (all
           serogroups) in South Australian school students at baseline and 12 months.

        -  Establish baseline carriage rates of each N. meningitidis serogroup (A, B, C, W-135, Y)
           in students in years 10, 11 12
