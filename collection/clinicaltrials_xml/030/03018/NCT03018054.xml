      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of E6007 once daily for 8 weeks in Japanese participants with moderate
      active ulcerative colitis. Participants will be stratified by prior therapeutic treatment
      and Mayo score at Baseline, and will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive E6007 30 milligrams
      (mg), E6007 60 mg or placebo.
