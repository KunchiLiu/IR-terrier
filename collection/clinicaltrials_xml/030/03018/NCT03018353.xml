      Curing HCV in Incarcerated Patients (CHIP) is a 1-year demonstration project that will
      assess the feasibility of a HCV treatment program in the San Francisco City &amp; County Jail.
      The Jail Health Services will treat 100 patients using the FDA approved combination
      treatment, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, Eplcusa® and will continue their treatment during
      incarceration and after their release (if applicable).

      Curing HCV in Incarcerated Patients (CHIP) is a 1-year demonstration project that will be
      conducted in the San Francisco County Jails. Jail settings can provide an optimal
      opportunity to screen for HCV, initiate curative treatment, and link patients to community
      HCV providers to complete their treatment. This demonstration project will be funded by the
      Gilead's Investigator Sponsored Research. The purpose is to assess the feasibility of
      treating inmates with the FDA approved combination oral treatment, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir,
      Eplcusa®. The San Francisco Department of Public Health's Jail Health Services will treat
      100 patients. Intensive patient navigators will be an essential component for treatment to
      ensure medication adherence and achieve SVR for those who are discharged from jail prior to
      HCV treatment completion. Navigators will provide short-term case management services by
      linking patients to medical and social support services. This demonstration project will be
      facilitated by the Jail Health Services' HIV &amp; Integrated Services (formerly Forensic AIDS
      Project).
