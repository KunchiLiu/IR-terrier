    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well medroxyprogesterone acetate with or without
      entinostat before surgery works in treating patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer.
      Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a progesterone, a hormone produced by body normally.
      Entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Given medroxyprogesterone acetate with or without entinostat may work better in
      treating patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor, entinostat, in
      combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) in the pre-operative setting
      results in up-regulation of activated progesterone receptors (PR) compared to Depo-Provera
      alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate (as measured by cellular morphology and proliferation) and
      change in activated receptor levels with the addition of entinostat at the time of
      hysterectomy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and
      undergo hysterectomy between days 21-24.

      ARM II: Patients receive medroxyprogesterone acetate IM on day 1 and entinostat orally (PO)
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients undergo hysterectomy between days 21-24.

          -  Patients with ECOG performance grade of 3 or 4

          -  Patients with history of thrombophlebitis within the past 2 years or ongoing

          -  Patients must not be currently taking or have ever taken vorinostat (Zolinza, Merck),
