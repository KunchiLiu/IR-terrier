  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      THINK (THerapeutic Immunotherapy with NKR-2) is a multinational (EU/US) open-label Phase I
      study to assess the safety and clinical activity of multiple administrations of autologous
      NKR-2 cells in seven refractory cancers, including five solid tumors (colorectal, ovarian,
      bladder, triple-negative breast and pancreatic cancers) and two hematological tumors (acute
      myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma).

      The trial will test three dose levels. At each dose, the patients will receive three
      successive administrations, two weeks apart, NKR-2 cells. The dose escalation part of the
      study will enroll up to 24 patients while the extension phase would enroll 86 additional
      patients.
