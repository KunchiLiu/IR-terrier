      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of brivaracetam (BRV) compared to
      placebo (PBO) as adjunctive treatment in Asian subjects (&gt;=16 to 80 years of age) with
      partial seizures with or without secondary generalization despite current treatment with 1
      or 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and to assess the safety and tolerability of BRV
      in subjects &gt;= 16 years to 80 years of age.

             accepted contraceptive method.

          -  Well-characterized focal epilepsy/epileptic syndrome according to the 1989
             International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification.

          -  Presence of an electroencephalogram (EEG) reading compatible with the clinical
             diagnosis of focal epilepsy within the last 5 years.

          -  Presence of a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT) scan
             performed within the last 2 years.

          -  Subjects having at least 8 partial seizures (according to the 1981 ILAE
             classification) during the 8-Week Baseline Period with at least 2 partial seizures
             during each 4-week interval of the Baseline Period.

          -  Subjects having at least 2 partial seizures whether or not secondary generalization
             per month during the 3 months preceding Visit 1.

          -  Subjects uncontrolled while treated by 1 or 2 permitted concomitant antiepileptic
             drug [AED](s). Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is allowed and will be counted as a
             concomitant AED.

          -  Permitted concomitant AED(s) and VNS being stable and at optimal dosage for the
             subject from at least 4 weeks (12 weeks for phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone)
             before Visit 1 and expected to be kept stable during whole study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has history or presence of status epilepticus during the year preceding Visit
             1 or during Baseline.

          -  Subject has history of cerebrovascular accident, including transient ischemic attack,
             in the last 24 weeks.

          -  Subject has history or presence of known psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.
