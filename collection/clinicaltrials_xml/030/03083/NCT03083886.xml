  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back and neck pain are among the leading causes of medical visits, lost productivity and
      disability. There is an urgent need to identify effective and efficient ways of helping
      subjects with acute spine pain while guiding practitioners towards high-value care. This
      trial will be a block and cluster-randomized open-label multi-centered pragmatic randomized
      clinical trial comparing healthcare spending and clinical outcomes for subjects with spine
      pain of less than six weeks duration, in whom there are no red flag signs or symptoms.
      Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment strategies: (1) usual primary care
      provider-led care; (2) usual PCP-led care with spine pain treatment directed by the
      Identify, Coordinate, and Enhanced decision making (ICE) care model, and (3) usual PCP-led
      care with spine pain treatment directed by the Individualized Postural Therapy (IPT) care
      model. Our outcomes of interest will be spine-related healthcare utilization at one year as
      well as pain and functionality of the study participants.

    <description>Subjects seeking care at a clinic assigned to this arm will receive the ICE care model through referral by their primary care provider. The ICE care model was developed by the Clinical Excellence Research Center at Stanford University based on a review of the peer-reviewed literature for adult subjects with incident neck or back pain less than six weeks in duration who are not using high-dose opioid medications or receiving spine-related long-term disability payments.</description>

    <intervention_name>Individualized Postural Therapy (IPT) + PCP led care</intervention_name>
    <description>IPT involves the evaluation of a subject's posture to identify postural and alignment deviations and, based on this, a personalized corrective exercise program is prescribed. This method does involve the use of prescription medications, surgery, or manipulation. A treatment course typically lasts eight sessions over eight weeks. In order to allow for the consistent delivery of this arm of the study at multiple study-sites across the country, IPT will be delivered by The Egoscue Method. Egoscue was founded in 1971 and has 25 clinics worldwide.</description>
