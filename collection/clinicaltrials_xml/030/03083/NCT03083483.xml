      The purpose of this study is to test the influences of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) and gaze training (GT) on the acquisition of laparoscopic surgical
      skills. For this purpose, the investigator will compare variants of tDCS and GT in
      experiments 1 and 2, respectively, and then compare the optimal variants from each of these
      in experiment 3 in a crossed design with a follow up test of retention. These questions will
      be evaluated using the validated Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) modules 1 and 5,
      with the overall goal of developing a surgical training curriculum that achieves expert
      level skill in an expedited timeframe. This research provides a novel approach to general
      surgery training that has the potential to reduce the amount of time and repetitions
      required to achieve expert laparoscopic skills.

    <textblock>
      Developing expert performance requires assessment of the thought processes underlying
      performance and continued refinement of skills in order to obtain automaticity and
      intuition. Therefore, developing expert surgical skill is a process likely to take longer
      than the length of residency, thereby diminishing the quality of care delivered to patients.

      The proposed study will implement novel neuroscience techniques of transcranial direct
      current stimulation and gaze training to determine if they have the capacity to accelerate
      technical surgical skill learning in order to achieve competency and expertise in an earlier
      timeframe. tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that delivers constant, low
      current stimulation via electrodes placed on the scalp to modify cortical excitability in an
      area of interest. When applied to the motor cortex, promising data indicates that
      tDCS-induced changes lead to expedited recovery in stroke patients as well as enhanced
      learning in healthy individuals.

      Studies of skill performance have demonstrated that eye movement patterns can be optimized
      to improve subsequent motor movements. Therefore, gaze training encourages novices to adopt
      the more efficient gaze patterns of experts while performing a specific task such as
      laparoscopic surgery. These techniques have never been applied in the training of surgical
      residents making this project an innovative approach to enhance skill development.

      Experiment 1: Determine if tDCS can accelerate the learning of laparoscopic skills.

      In this experiment the investigators will compare behavioral learning curves from FLS
      modules 1 and 5 in three cohorts who undergo either active tDCS to the bilateral motor
      cortex (bilateral configuration), active tDCS to the supplementary motor cortex (SMA
      configuration), or sham tDCS (half in each configuration). This will be tested in groups of
      20 participants who train for 40-minutes in each of 6 sessions that occur within 3 weeks.
      The investigators hypothesize that both active bilateral and SMA tDCS will lead to faster
      skill acquisition as measured by trials required to gain proficient completion scores
      (calculated as time plus errors), relative to sham.

      The investigators hypothesize that both bilateral and vertex tDCS will lead to faster skill
      acquisition, with bilateral greater than vertex as measured by trials required to gain
      proficient module completion scores, relative to the group of participants who practice
      without active tDCS.

      Experiment 2: Determine if gaze training can accelerate the learning of laparoscopic skills.

      In this experiment the investigators will first establish expert gaze patterns in the
      Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery modules 1 and 5 by testing a total of 9 participants,
      including attending surgeons, senior residents, and novices trained to proficiency. The
      investigators will then compare behavioral learning curves from non-expert participants
      without gaze training against those trained using both explicit (by reviewing the expert
      gaze pattern) and implicit gaze (by using a visual mask during the training, leading the
      participant to follow the expert gaze) derived from the expert gaze patterns. This will be
      tested in 3 groups of 20 participants, who train for 40-minutes in each of 6 sessions that
      occur within 3 weeks.

      The investigators hypothesize that both explicit and implicit gaze training will lead to
      faster skill acquisition, with implicit greater than explicit and measured by trials
      required to gain proficient module completion scores, relative to the group of participants
      who practice without any gaze training.

      Experiment 3: Compare tDCS and gaze training in a crossed design to evaluate learning and
      retention.

      In this experiment the investigators will utilize the most effective active tDCS condition
      from experiment 1 and the most effective Gaze Training condition from experiment 2 in a
      crossed design to evaluate learning and retention. In this crossed design, four groups of 20
      participants that receive either: active tDCS and gaze training, active tDCS with no gaze
      training, gaze training with sham tDCS, or just sham tDCS. In each case, participants will
      partake in 6 sessions of 40-minutes, training on FLS modules 1 and 5, and will also
      participate in a follow up FLS assessment, 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of training to
      evaluate the retention of trained skills. The investigators hypothesize that applying tDCS
      and gaze training will result in additive improvement on learning curves, and will lead to
      greater retention of trained skills at the follow up assessment, compared to either
      condition alone or to the sham group.
