      The primary objective of this study is to:

      -Test the activity/response rate per RECIST 1.1 criteria of anetumab ravtansine in patients
      with advanced pancreatic cancer who stain for mesothelin expression

      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

        -  Time to Progression (TTP) defined as time from study treatment to RECIST 1.1
           progression, or death (others going off study will be censored)

        -  Toxicity in pancreatic cancer patients (at 6.5 mg/kg dose)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of intravenous anetumab ravtansine (BAY 94-9343), an anti-mesothelin antibody
      drug conjugate, in pretreated mesothelin-expressing advanced pancreatic cancer.

      At the time of the start of study treatment, the patients will have pretreated advanced
      pancreatic cancer that also overexpresses mesothelin as determined by immunohistochemistry
      (IHC).

      A maximum of 30 patients will be enrolled in a minimax, Simon 2-stage design with a single
      early stopping rule for lack of efficacy. The target population is those patients with
      pancreatic cancer who have failed an earlier treatment. All patients will be treated with an
      anti-mesothelin immuno-conjugate, in this single arm, non-randomized trial and all patients
      treated with at least one dose of Anetumab will be included. The endpoint is any response
      using the RECIST 1.1 criteria.

        Eligibility criteria for prescreening

          -  Patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer who have measurable disease; must
             not have had at least one and not more than two prior chemotherapy regimens for
             advanced disease (neoadjuvant chemotherapy would not be counted as a line of
             therapy). If prior radiation, measurable lesion outside radiation portal. ECOG
             performance status 0-1; Mesothelin positive. Must have normal organ function with
             LFTs &lt;2.5 x ULN, no history of keratitis or corneal disease.

          -  Written informed consent for prescreening.

          -  Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, confirmed by

        for the patient's safety. Patients with a sarcomatoid histology are not expected to have
        mesothelin overexpression and should not enter prescreening.
