  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the overall response rate (ORR) in non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) participants treated with daratumumab in combination with atezolizumab
      versus atezolizumab alone.

    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 response criteria. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria for target lesions and assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), greater than or equal to (&gt;=)30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</description>
