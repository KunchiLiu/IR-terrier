  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares two lengths of medication therapy (a shortened versus a prolonged dual
      antiplatelet therapy) in order to prevent thrombus (blood cloth) formation after the
      successfully treatment for coronary heart disease with a drug covered stent (metallic tube).

      This comparison will be done in patients who, compared to the average patient, are more
      likely to suffer from complications on antiplatelet therapy (bleeding). Both durations are
      within the current medical recommendations. The aim of this study is to help improve further
      standard antiplatelet duration guidelines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to determine in a high bleeding risk patient population undergoing
      PCI under standardized treatment (within current guidelines and instructions for use and
      including the bioresorbable polymer coated Ultimaster sirolimus-eluting stent), whether
      abbreviated DAPT is non-inferior to prolonged DAPT regimen in terms of NACE within 12
      months, whether abbreviated DAPT is non-inferior to prolonged DAPT regimen in terms of MACCE
      within 12 months and whether abbreviated DAPT is superior to prolonged DAPT regimen in terms
      of MCB within 12 months.

      There are two treatment strategies:

        -  abbreviated dual anti-platelet therapy: dual antiplatelet therapy is discontinued and a
           single antiplatelet agent is continued until at least 11 months post randomization
           (i.e. 12 months post stent implantation). In patients on oral anticoagulants, dual
           antiplatelet therapy is discontinued and either Aspirin or Clopidogrel is continued
           until 5 months post randomization (i.e. 6 months post stent implantation). Oral
           anticoagulation is continued until at least 11 months post randomization (i.e. 12
           months post stent implantation) OR

        -  prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy: aspirin is continued for at least 11 months post
           randomization (i.e. 12 months post stent implantation), the P2Y12 inhibitor being taken
           at the time of randomization is continued for at least 5 months and up to 11 months
           post randomization (i.e. 12 months post stent implantation). In patients on oral
           anticoagulants, aspirin and Clopidogrel are continued for at least 2 months post
           randomization (i.e. 3 months post stent implantation) and up to 11 months post
           randomization (i.e. 12 months after stent implantation). Therefore either aspirin or
           Clopidogrel is continued up to 11 months post randomization (i.e. 12 months post stent
           implantation)

      The study design is an investigator-initiated, randomized, multi-center, clinical trial to
      be conducted in approximately 100 interventional cardiology centers in across the globe
      excluding USA. The study includes 2 x 2150 patients (i.e. 4300 patients) Randomization will
      occur at one month after the PCI procedure. The expected duration of participation for each
      patient is 14 months.

        if the following criteria are met.

          1. At least one among the HBR criteria (as defined below) is met.

          2. All lesions are successfully treated with Ultimaster stent in the context of routine

          3. Free from any flow-limiting angiographic complications (i.e. significant untreated
             dissection or major side-branch occlusion), which require prolonged DAPT duration
             based on operator's opinion.

          4. All stages of PCI are complete (if any) and no further PCI is planned.

        At randomization visit (one month after index PCI), the following criteria must be met:

          1. Fulfilment of at least one HBR criterion (as defined below), or on the basis of
             post-PCI actionable (i.e. requiring medical attention) non-access site related
             bleeding episode

          2. Uneventful 30-day clinical course, i.e. free from spontaneous MI, symptomatic
             restenosis, stent thrombosis, stroke and any revascularization (coronary and
             non-coronary) requiring prolonged DAPT

          3. If not on OAC,

               1. Patient is on a DAPT regimen of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor

               2. Patient with one type of P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 7 days (i.e. no switching
