  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, 24-month, longitudinal study of patients planning to undergo
      bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass or Sleeve Gastrectomy) in which we aim to
      identify correlates and predictors of observed weight loss trajectories following bariatric
      surgery. This approach will expand current knowledge by examining the combined impact of
      empirically supported behavioral and biological data in a large sample over time. Intensive
      measurement of problematic eating behaviors, mood, and compliance with diet and exercise
      regimens post-surgery will be analyzed in the context of lterations in parallel with, or in
      response to, changes observed in the gut microbiota. Identifying these post-surgical
      predictors of weight loss and comorbidity resolution will allow for the development of
      individualized interventions to optimize surgery-related outcomes.
