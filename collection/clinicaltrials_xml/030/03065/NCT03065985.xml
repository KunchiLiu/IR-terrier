    <description>Patients in the treatment group will receive standard chemotherapy plus 3 radiofrequency ablation procedures, each one month apart.
Investigators will use the Habib™ EUS-RFA, product number 6700, which is a 1 Fr wire (0.33 mm, 0.013&quot;) with a working length of 200 cm, which can be inserted through the biopsy channel of an echoendoscope and is compatible with a 19G or 22G echoendoscopic needle. RF power is applied to the electrode at the end of the wire to coagulate tissue in the pancreas at 10 Watts for 2 minutes for each application. It has a CE mark and FDA 510(k) approval.</description>
