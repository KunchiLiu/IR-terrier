  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clonidine has been reported to be effective in a variety of hyperadrenergic states,
      including mania. It is generally well-tolerated and does not result in the severe adverse
      effects that are associated with many antipsychotics and mood stabilizers used in the
      treatment of mania, such as weight gain and akathisia. There is some suggestion that
      clonidine may be particularly effective in a subset of refractory cases and in patients who
      cannot tolerate antipsychotic medications or lithium. The investigators plan to to study an
      extended-release form of clonidine, which the investigators hope will be even better
      tolerated than the immediate-release form, as an antimanic agent. Subjects will receive an
      extended-release form of clonidine in addition to their usual medication regimen on the
      second day of this three-day study. Rating scales, a record of sleep, and a questionnaire of
      adverse effects will be recorded on each of the 3 days. Any medication changes made by the
      attending psychiatrist and prns administered will be recorded throughout the study. The
      investigators believe that studying as few as 10 subjects will give the investigators a
      sense as to whether the addition of clonidine is helpful in reducing manic symptoms and the
      rate of adverse effects is unacceptable. See below for study results and reason for
      termination after recruiting only five subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Five subjects were recruited. The extended-release form of clonidine appeared to be
      well-tolerated, but anti-manic effects, if any, appeared to be small. Results were difficult
      to interpret because of a variety of confounding factors. Only one of the five subjects did
      not receive the second dose of extended-release clonidine on the Treatment Day. It was not
      given because of sedation and hypotension; N.B. this subject was given a large dose of prn
      clonazepam 45 minutes after receiving the study drug. Other confounding factors included one
      subject being punched in the face by another patient during the study and another subject
      receiving unexpected good news during the study. These events likely influenced scores on
      rating forms. Also, subjects received a variety of prn medications during the study. Given
      that it appeared likely that the antimanic effect of the study medication was small, a high
      N would be required to confirm, and an N of 10 was deemed too low, so recruitment was
      stopped at five.
