      There are 2 parts to this clinical research study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2
      (expansion).

      The goal of Part 1 of this study is to find the highest tolerable dose of neratinib in
      combination with everolimus, Ibrance (palbociclib), or trametinib that can be given to
      patients who have advanced cancer with a specific mutation (EGFR, HER2, HER3, or HER4).

      The goal of Part 2 of this study is to learn if the dose of neratinib in combination with
      everolimus, Ibrance (palbociclib), or trametinib found in Part 1 can help to control
      advanced cancer in patients who have a specific mutation.

      The safety of this drug will also be studied in both parts of the study.

      Study Groups:

      Depending on the type of disease and when participant joins the study, participant will
      receive 1 of 3 drug combinations:

        -  Group A: Neratinib and Everolimus

        -  Group B: Neratinib and Palbociclib

        -  Group C: Neratinib and Trametinib

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in each study group.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      assigned a study drug dose based on when participant joins this study. About 3-6
      participants will be enrolled per study drug dose.

      If participant is in Part 2, participant will receive neratinib in combination with
      everolimus, palbociclib, or trametinib at the highest dose that was safe and tolerated in
      Part 1.

      A total of about 18-90 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study. About 10
      participants will be enrolled per group and up to a total of 30 participants will be
      enrolled in Part 2.

      If participant is in Part 1, the dose of neratinib in combination with everolimus,
      palbociclib, or trametinib you receive will depend on when participant joins this study.

      The study doctor will let you know what study group and which part of the study you
      participant is participating in.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days. The following directions are for participants in both Part 1
      and Part 2.

      Participant will take neratinib by mouth 1 time a day with food, preferably in the morning,
      every day. If participant misses any dose(s) of neratinib, do not make up the missed
      dose(s). However, if it has been less than 6 hours since participant was meant to take
      participant's dose, participant may take participant's dose that day as soon as participant
      remembers. It is important that participant takes neratinib at the same time every day.
      Neratinib must be stored at room temperature and out of direct sunlight.

      There will be a 30 minute waiting period between participant's dose of neratinib and
      participant's other study drug(s) during Cycle 1. After that, there is no waiting period.

      If participant is in Group A, participant will take everolimus by mouth 1 time a day with
      neratinib every day. Everolimus must be stored at room temperature, kept dry and away from
      light.

      If participant is in Group B, participant will take palbociclib by mouth 1 time a day with
      neratinib, every day for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week &quot;rest period&quot; during each cycle.
      Palbociclib must be stored at room temperature.

      If participant is in Group C, participant will take trametinib by mouth 1 time a day with
      neratinib every day. Trametinib must be stored in a refrigerator (do not freeze), kept dry
      and away from light.

      Participant will also take Imodiumâ„¢ (loperamide) to lower the risk of diarrhea caused by
      neratinib. Along with participant's first dose of neratinib, participant will take 2 tablets
      of loperamide by mouth 3 times a day for the first 14 days of Cycle 1. After that,
      participant will take 2 tablets 2 times a day for the rest of Cycle 1. After Cycle 1,
      participant will take loperamide as needed. If diarrhea continues despite taking loperamide,
      participant should call participant's doctor or nurse. If participant is constipated,
      participant should call participant's study doctor but should not discontinue Imodium use
      unless specifically instructed by participant's doctor.

      Participant's study doctor or staff will contact participant on each of the first 3 days
      after participant starts taking neratinib to ask if participant has diarrhea and to make any
      changes to participant's treatment. Participant's study doctor will give participant a
      separate instruction sheet that will explain how to manage diarrhea.

      Participant will receive a study drug diary in which participant will record the date and
      time of each dose of study drugs. Participant's study doctor will also tell participant to
      record the number of stools participant has per day and the dose of loperamide participant
      takes each day for the first cycle of therapy. Participant will need to record all doses of
      study drugs for the entire study. Participant will need to bring the diary to participant's
      study visits. Participant must also bring any unused study drug and the pill bottles (even
      if empty) to the clinic on Day 1 of each cycle.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to
      follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 (some of these tests will not be performed if participant had them the
      last 72 hours):

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-5 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, including genetic
           biomarkers.

        -  Participant will have an EKG to check participant's heart function.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a
           pregnancy test.

      On Days 2-4 of Cycle 1, the study staff will call participant to ask about any symptoms
      participant may be having. The call should last about 5 minutes.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, including genetic
           biomarkers.

        -  On Day 15 only, blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn before and then 5
           times over the next 5 hours after study drugs dose for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK
           testing measures the amount of study drug in the blood at different time points.

        -  If participant is in Part 2, on Day 15 only, participant will have a core or excisional
           biopsy for biomarker testing (including genetic biomarkers).

      On Day 16 of Cycle 1 (about 20-28 hours after participant's Day 15 dose of study drugs),
      blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PK testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-5 teaspoons) and urine will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, including genetic
           biomarkers.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and 5, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn before the study drug
      dose for PK testing.

      Every 8 weeks, participant will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.
      After 6 months, participant will have a CT scan or MRI scan every 12 weeks.

      Every 12 weeks, participant will have an ECHO or MUGA scan.

      Participant may have eye exams (Group C only) and other routine tests performed if the study
      doctor thinks they are needed.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After participant's last study drug dose:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check
           how well participant's blood clots.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  Participant may have an ECHO or MUGA scan. This scan will not be performed if
           participant had them done in the last 12 weeks.

        -  Participant will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      If participant goes off study because the disease gets worse, participant will be called
      every 3 months for 1 year. Participant will be asked about how participant is doing and if
      participant has received any new treatment for cancer. The calls should last about 15
      minutes.

      Follow-up Visits:

      About 30 days after participant's last dose of study drug, blood (about 4-5 teaspoons) and
      urine will be collected for routine tests.

      This is an investigational study. Neratinib is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Everolimus is commercially available
      and FDA approved for the treatment of several disease types, including breast cancer and
      renal cell carcinoma. Palbociclib is commercially available and FDA approved for the
      treatment of ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Trametinib is commercially available
      and FDA approved for the treatment of melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 120 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
