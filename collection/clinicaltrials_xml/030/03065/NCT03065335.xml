      Background:

      Most medications that treat depression take weeks or months to work. Researchers want to
      develop fast-acting treatments. One dose of ketamine has a rapid antidepressant effect. For
      most people, this lasts a week or less. Repeated doses of ketamine may help maintain this
      effect.

      Objective:

      To study the effects of ketamine in treating depression.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18-65 with major depressive disorder and healthy volunteers

      Design:

      Participants will be screened in another study, with:

        -  Medical and psychiatric history

        -  Psychiatric and physical exam

        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Participants will be inpatients at NIH for 4 phases totaling 14-20 weeks.

      Phase I (2-7 weeks):

        -  Gradually stop current medications

        -  MRI: Participants lie and perform tasks in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

        -  Mood and thinking tests

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Sleep test: Monitors on the skin record brain waves, breathing, heart rate, and
           movement during sleep.

        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation: A coil on the scalp gives an electrical current that
           affects brain activity.

        -  Stress tests: Electrodes on the skin measure reactions to loud noises or electric
           shocks.

      Phase I tests are repeated in Phases II and III and in the final visit.

      Phase II (4 5 weeks):

        -  4 weekly IV infusions of ketamine or a placebo during an MRI or MEG. For the MEG, a
           cone over the head records brain activity.

      Phase III (optional):

        -  8 infusions of ketamine over 4 weeks

      Phase IV (optional):

        -  Symptoms monitoring for 4 weeks

        -  Participants will have a final visit. They will be offered standard treatment at NIH
           for up to 2 months.

      Objective

      Intravenous ketamine and other glutamatergic modulating agents have demonstrated rapid
      improvement in depressive symptoms. In previous investigations conducted by our group, a
      non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (i.e. ketamine) was effective in patients who had
      failed at least 2 antidepressant treatments (i.e. treatment-resistant depression). Response
      to a single dose of ketamine typically occurred within 2 hours and lasted approximately 1
      week. While several studies have investigated acute neural response to ketamine infusion in
      healthy volunteers, data regarding neuropharmacodynamic effects of ketamine in patients is
      limited. Therefore, further investigations of biological mechanism and neural correlates of
      response (or non-response) associated with single dose ketamine administration are needed.
      Furthermore, few studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of prolonged, repeated
      administration (i.e., more than one administration) of subanesthetic doses of intravenously
      infused ketamine to achieve a sustained antidepressant response. Therefore, there is great
      need and potential in identifying biomarkers of both response to single infusion and to
      repeated ketamine administration.

      The current protocol has a two-fold purpose. In the pharmacodynamic imaging phase, we plan
      to investigate the neuropharmacodynamics of acute ketamine administration in patients with
      major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy volunteers (HV) using functional MRI (fMRI) and
      electrophysiological modalities [electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography
      (MEG)]. Additionally, we plan to investigate whether specific signatures from functional
      neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) associated evoked potentials (TMS-EP),
      sleep EEG (S-EEG), and psychophysiologic responses can be used to classify specific
      subpopulations of patients with MDD; preliminary findings from such an approach may be
      important in forging further studies identifying those who will respond to ketamine
      infusions. In the repeat-dosing phase, we plan to expand upon our previous findings of the
      immediate efficacy of glutamatergic modulators by investigating the safety and efficacy of
      repeated dose administrations of IV ketamine infusions for patients with MDD. We plan to
      include all MDD patients regardless of antidepressant response to single infusions of
      ketamine to allow for potential identification of MDD patients who are able to eventually
      attain and/or maintain an antidepressant response over a course of a series of infusions. In
      an effort to reduce any potential biases due to partial blinding, all patients will be
      administered ketamine but randomized into either a group who will receive ketamine at 0.5
      mg/kg or a group who will receive ketamine at 0.1 mg/kg (an active comparator).

      Study Population

      The study population will consist of 50 individuals between the 18 and 65 years of age, with
      a diagnosis of treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 50 age/gender matched
      healthy volunteer subjects (HV). Within the MDD group, 25 participants will be enrolled into
      each treatment group in the repeat-dosing phase.

      Study Design

      This study is a Phase I Clinical Trial that comprises four phases.

      Phase I includes screening, medication taper (as needed), medication-free period, and
      baseline assessments. Some of the baseline assessments include optional tests that are
      designed to probe neurobiological function: a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) test
      with associated evoked potential test (TMS-EP), an overnight sleep adaptation in a sleep lab
      in preparation for overnight sleep electroencephalography (S-EEG), and a psychophysiology
      paradigm called the None, Predictive, Unpredictive (NPU)-threat test, and blood samples to
      assess plasma neurochemicals and peripheral blood biomarkers.

      In Phase II, all subjects will then receive an alternating series of placebo and ketamine
      0.5 mg/kg infusions, occurring once per week, for a total of 4 infusions (2 ketamine and 2
      placebo). Patients will be randomized to receive either ketamine first or placebo first;
      subjects who are randomized to receive ketamine for the first infusion will receive placebo
      for the second infusion and vice-versa if randomized initially to placebo. Concurrently with
      each infusion, subjects will be administered either a resting-state (task free) functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG), or a
      resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording such that each subject receives
      fMRI+EEG and MEG for both a placebo and ketamine infusion. Of note, subjects for whom one
      imaging modality is not acquired due to unforeseen issues, may still be administered the
      other. Therefore, all subjects will potentially participate in both imaging modalities, with
      the order of the fMRI+EEG and MEG scans counterbalanced across participants. Also during
      Phase II, if MDD and HV participants have agreed to the optional testing, S-EEG will may be
      obtained one day prior to and one day after the first two infusions in the series, TMS-EP
      will may be obtained on the same day of the first two infusions with subsequent testing if a
      patient responds to any of the first two infusions, and NPU will may be obtained 1-3 days
      after the first two infusions.

      Phase III involves participants with MDD whose depression symptoms have relapsed after the
      final infusion in Phase II.. Patients whose symptoms did not relapse may receive an
      additional one-week washout before randomization in Phase III. During this phase, subjects
      will be randomized to receive ketamine at a higher dose of 0.5 mg/kg, or at a lower dose of
      0.1 mg/kg (an active comparator) that will occur twice weekly for 4 additional weeks and a
      total of eight infusions. Optional tests, including S-EEG, TMS-EP, and NPU, may be conducted
      at specified time points between ketamine infusions. Clinical rating scales will be
      administered to assess depression symptomology and blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetics
      testing and biomarker analyses.

      Phase IV includes MDD participants who completed Phase III and who are responders (defined
      as MADRS reduced by 50% from baseline) will be followed up for an additional 4 weeks, or
      until relapse (defined as having 2 consecutive ratings demonstrating less than or equal to
      25% improvement from baseline MADRS), to determine durability of response. The final study
      day includes clinical rating scales, medical evaluations, and blood tests. As a safety
      measure, the sMRI will be repeated to assess for structural changes that may have occurred
      as a result of repeated ketamine infusions.

      Outcome Measures

      The primary outcome measure of Phase II will be the pharmacodynamic fMRI [(ph)fMRI] and MEG
      responses to ketamine 0.5 mg/kg compared to placebo. Secondary outcome measures will include
      the difference in MADRS score from baseline to 24 hours between the placebo and ketamine
      0.5mg/kg infusion, correlations between an antidepressant response and TMS-EP, S-EEG,
      neuroimaging (fMRI+EEG and MEG), and psychophysiology (NPU-threat test) measures. In Phase
      II, the healthy volunteer (HV) group will act as another level of control to identify a
      potential neuropharmacodynamic signature associated with an antidepressant response to
      ketamine.

      The primary outcome measure for Phase III will be the difference or change of score on the
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline to the end of 4 weeks of
      twice-weekly ketamine 0.5 mg/kg compared to 0.1 mg/kg. An antidepressant response is defined
      as a reduction of at least 50% from baseline on the MADRS. Secondary outcome measures
      include TMS-EP, S-EEG, and psychophysiology (NPU-threat test) measures.

      Other outcome measures for both Phase II and III include clinical rating scales,
      neurocognitive tests,: The Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ), Barratt Impulsivity
      Scale (BIS), Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BP), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
      (BPRS), Borderline Symptom List (BSL), Clinician-Administered Dissociative State Scale
      (CADSS), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire
      (CTQ), Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS), Family History Screen (FHS),
      Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS),
      Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (MGH-CPFQ),
      Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Patient-Rated Inventory of Side Effects
      (PRISE), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS), Ruminative Rating Scale (RRS),
      Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), ketamine levels
      (e.g, ketamine and metabolites), plasma neurochemicals, and peripheral blood biomarkers.
      Additional outcomes in Phase III are baseline and post-repeated dose infusion 3T MRI scans
      as well as performance on the Stroop test, Trail Making Test (TMT), immediate recall
      assessment from the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), and the Spatial Span Test. The
      clinical rating scales outcomes measures of Phase IV are the BIS, BP, BPRS, BSL, CADSS,
      C-SSRS, CTQ, DESS, HAM-A, HDRS, MADRS, MGH-CPFQ, PANAS, PRISE, QIDS, RRS, SHAPS, and YMRS.
      Subjects will continue Phase IV for 4 weeks or until relapse (defined as less than or equal
      to 25% decrease in MADRS compared to baseline for two consecutive ratings).
