      The primary aim of this study is to develop a feasible, acceptable, and effective multilevel
      physical activity (PA) intervention that addresses both individual and interpersonal factors
      that can be easily scalable and delivered in the context of a methadone clinic. To do so,
      the investigators will train methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients who are already
      engaging in PA at public health recommended levels to deliver a group-based PA intervention
      to physically inactive MMT patients at a large community-based methadone clinic. Through the
      development of interpersonal relationships and social support, the investigators expect that
      MMT peers who have successfully navigated challenges associated with PA in this population
      (i.e. depression, smoking, triggers for drug use in environment) will help physically
      inactive MMT patients increase self-efficacy and motivation for initiating and sustaining
      PA.

    <textblock>
      Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) are a highly prevalent and costly public health concern in the
      United States, with over 2.59 million Americans qualifying for abuse or dependence of
      opioids in 2015. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), involving daily distribution of
      methadone at regulated clinics, is the most common treatment for opioid use disorder. While
      MMT has been effective in helping OUD patients improve their quality of life, the
      overwhelming majority of these patients continue to engage in unhealthy lifestyles (e.g.,
      physical inactivity and cigarette smoking) that lead to significant physical and mental
      health morbidities. For example, patients in MMT have much higher rates of cardiovascular
      disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, depression, sleep difficulties, and cognitive
      impairments than age-matched controls, which lead to premature death. Given the mental
      health, physical health, and drug use related benefits of physical activity (PA),
      interventions targeting increases in PA in patients receiving MMT could have a significant
      impact on reducing their overall morbidity and mortality.

      To date, few PA studies have been conducted with substance abusing populations - and, only
      one small pilot study with MMT patients. Our goal is to develop a feasible, acceptable and
      effective multilevel PA intervention that addresses both individual and interpersonal
      factors that can be easily scalable and delivered in the context of a health care setting
      (i.e., methadone clinics). To do so, we are proposing to train MMT patients who are already
      engaging in PA at public health recommended levels to deliver a group-based PA intervention
      to physically inactive MMT patients at SSTAR Lifeline, a large community-based methadone
      clinic in Fall River, Massachusetts. Peer-facilitated interventions for self-management
      skills are common in the care of patients with chronic medical conditions. Peers may play a
      particularly important role in increasing physical activity in MMT, as this population faces
      unique and significant barriers to PA (e.g., depression, smoking, minimal social supports).
      Through the development of interpersonal relationships, the investigators expect that MMT
      peers who have successfully navigated these challenges will help physically inactive MMT
      patients increase self-efficacy and motivation for initiating and sustaining PA.

      The aims of the study include:

        1. PHASE 1 (Peer-PA Manual Development):

             -  To develop a theoretically-informed peer-facilitated PA plus Fitbit
                (Peer-PA+Fitbit) intervention specific to SSTAR Lifeline, in order to help
                patients in MMT increase levels of physical activity.

                  1. We will conduct focus groups with: 1) MMT patients who are currently
                     physically active and 2) MMT patients who are NOT meeting recommended PA
                     levels to help inform intervention development.

                  2. We will (1) develop a manualized Peer-PA intervention (that includes the use
                     of a Fitbit activity monitor for self-monitoring PA and additional social
                     networking), (2) create a training protocol for MMT patients to become
                     peer-facilitators, and (3) identify safe, walkable paths in participant
                     neighborhoods.

        2. PHASE 2 (Open Pilot):

             -  To conduct an open pilot trial with 20 MMT patients to determine the feasibility,
                acceptability, and shortterm increases in PA of the Peer-PA+Fitbit intervention.
                At the end of 3 months:

                  1. We will obtain feedback on Peer-PA+Fitbit from both the MMT peers and
                     participants through self-report measures and qualitative interviews.

                  2. We will determine adherence to the intervention through group attendance and
                     Fitbit data.

                  3. We will examine short-term increases in physical activity levels through
                     objectively measured PA.
