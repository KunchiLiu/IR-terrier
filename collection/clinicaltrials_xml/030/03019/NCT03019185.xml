      This international, multi-center, Phase 2/3 trial will study the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in qualified patients with Alport syndrome. The Phase 2
      portion of the trial will be open-label and enroll up to 30 patients. The Phase 3 portion of
      the trial will be double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled and will enroll up to 180
      patients.

      This international, multi-center, Phase 2/3 trial will study the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in qualified patients with Alport syndrome. The Phase 2
      portion of the trial will be open-label and enroll up to 30 patients. The Phase 3 portion of
      the trial will be double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled and will enroll up to 180
      patients.

      Patients in the Phase 2 cohort will receive bardoxolone methyl throughout the study.
      Patients in the Phase 3 cohort will be randomized 1:1 to either bardoxolone methyl or
      placebo and randomization will be stratified by baseline albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR).
      Patients randomized to placebo will remain on placebo throughout the study, undergoing sham
      titration.

      All patients in the study will follow the same visit and assessment schedule. Following
      randomization on Day 1, patients will be scheduled to be assessed during treatment at Weeks
      1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 52, 64, 76, 88, 100, and 104 and by telephone contact on Days
      3, 10, 21, 31, 38, and 45. Patients will not receive study drug during a 4-week withdrawal
      period between Weeks 48 and 52. They will re-start treatment at Week 52 at the same dose
      they received at Week 48 and will continue study drug treatment through Week 100. Patients
      will also be scheduled to be assessed at an in person follow up visit at Week 104, four
      weeks after the end of treatment.

    <description>Patients in the Phase 2 cohort will receive bardoxolone methyl throughout the study. Patients with baseline ACR ≤ 300 mg/g will be titrated to a maximum dose of 20 mg, and patients with baseline ACR &gt; 300 mg/g will be titrated to a maximum dose of 30 mg. Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) receiving bardoxolone methyl will start with once-daily dosing at 5 mg and will dose-escalate to 10 mg at Week 2, to 20 mg at Week 4, and then to 30 mg at Week 6 (only if baseline ACR &gt;300 mg/g) unless contraindicated clinically and approved by the medical monitor. Patients under the age of 18 receiving bardoxolone methyl will start 5 mg every other day during the first week and begin once-daily dosing with 5 mg during the second week of the study, and then continue with once-daily dosing following the same aforementioned dose titration scheme based on baseline ACR at Weeks 2, 4, and 6.</description>
