      This is a phase 1, interventional single arm, open label, treatment study designed to
      evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to contain
      an anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 scFv coupled to CD3ζ and 4-1BB signaling domains in patients with
      relapsed and/or refractory CD19 or CD20 positive B cell malignancies
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open label phase I study to demonstrate the feasibility
      of manufacturing CAR-T cells expressing tandem receptors against both CD20 and CD19
      (CAR-20/19-T) in a completely closed system using the CliniMACS Prodigy device and then
      determine the safety of this dual targeted CAR in a first-in-human study of patients with
      relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies. Secondary outcomes will include response rates,
      and observed toxicities of the treatment, specifically the development of cytokine release
      syndrome (CRS), an inflammatory storm that has been seen with previous CAR-T therapies.

        Special Criteria for regarding Fertility and Contraception

        Female subjects of reproductive potential (women who have reached menarche or women who
        have not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., who have had
        menses within the preceding 24 months, or have not undergone a sterilization procedure
        [hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy]) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
        test performed as part of eligibility criteria and again within 48 hours of initiation of
        lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

        Due to the high-risk level of this study, while enrolled, all subjects must agree not to
        participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to
        impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). Additionally, if participating in
        sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the study subject must agree to use reliable
        and double barrier methods of contraception during the follow-up period of the protocol.

        Acceptable birth control includes a combination of two of the following methods:

          -  Condoms* (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent.

          -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  Hormonal-based contraception

        Subjects who are not of reproductive potential (women who are premenarche or have been
        post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy tubal
        ligation, salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy or men who have documented
        azoospermia) are eligible without requiring the use of contraception. Acceptable
        documentation of sterilization, azoospermia, and menopause is specified below:

        Written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's staff of one of the
        following:

          -  Physician report/letter

          -  Operative report or other source documentation in the subject record of successful
             vasectomy

          -  Discharge summary

          -  Laboratory report of azoospermia

          -  Follicle stimulating hormone measurement elevated into the menopausal range
