  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether corifollitropin alfa (MK-8962),
      administered in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), increases the
      testicular volume in adolescent males aged 14 to &lt;18. In addition, the study will evaluate
      participants for the development of corifollitropin alfa antibodies over the course of 64
      weeks of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have legal representative who understands the study procedures, alternative
             treatments available and risks involved with the study, and voluntarily agrees to the
             individual's participation by giving written informed consent, and the individual has
             an age-appropriate understanding of the same to give informed written assent if
             applicable.

          -  Diagnosed with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (either isolated or associated with
             panhypopituitarism), either congenital or acquired with onset prior to puberty.

          -  Have bilateral pre-gonadarche testes as defined by testicular volume &lt;4.0 mL for each
             testicle, as determined by ultrasound and assessed by the investigator (if qualified)
             or local radiologist with appropriate training and expertise in reading testicular
             ultrasound. Note: participants with a volume of &lt;4.0 mL in one testicle and a volume
             of 4-8 mL in the other testicle are considered to be pre-gonadarche and may
             participate, if there is no history or evidence of a primary testicular disorder (see
             Exclusion Criteria 1 and 2).

          -  Circulating levels of total testosterone (Total T) less than the lower limit of
             normal (LLN) of 8.3 nmol/L as specified by the central lab for a young healthy adult
             male.

          -  Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ≤2 IU/L and luteinizing hormone (LH) ≤2 IU/L.

          -  Inhibin-B levels ≤35 pg/mL. (Note: if individual has inhibin-B levels &gt;35 pg/mL, but
             meets all of the other inclusion/exclusion criteria, either a GnRH agonist (GnRHa)
             stimulation test or GnRH IV infusion test may be performed.

          -  In good general physical and mental health, in the opinion of the
             investigator/sponsor, as assessed by physical examination and routine clinical
             laboratory tests.

          -  Have a parent/guardian able and willing to support the individual's participation by
             supporting adherence to study drug dosing and visit schedules.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of bilateral cryptorchidism (maldescended testes) or unilateral
             cryptorchidism treated after the age of 2 years.

             epididymitis, orchitis, testicular torsion, varicocele Grade III, testicular atrophy,
             occlusive azoospermia, etc.) that would impair participants response to treatment or
             has had known damage or injury to the vas deferens.

             of androgens (i.e., for less than 2 weeks) that was stopped at least 6 months prior
             to signing informed consent can also be included in the trial.

          -  Untreated or inadequately treated pituitary or hypothalamic tumor.

          -  Uncontrolled endocrinopathies, including thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary disorders
             not on stable replacement therapies.

          -  History of active pituitary hypersecretion as evidenced by hyperprolactinemia or
             Cushing's disease, acromegaly, or any other active pituitary hypersecretion syndrome.

             of hypersecretion for at least 12 months prior to screening, may participate.

          -  Has had hypophysectomy within 12 months to the start of screening.

          -  History of oncologic chemotherapy treatment.

          -  Brain radiotherapy within 12 months of start of treatment for a primary tumor, or any
             history of brain radiotherapy for metastatic disease.

          -  Diabetes mellitus.

          -  History of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          -  Clinically significant liver disease, including active viral hepatitis or cirrhosis.

             successfully treated may be enrolled if all liver function values performed within
             the past year have been normal and within the normal range at Visit 1.

          -  Recent history of recreational or illicit drug use, including marijuana; or routinely
