  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      versus paclitaxel in Asian, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive participants with
      advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have progressed after
      failure of any combination chemotherapy containing a platinum and a fluoropyrimidine agent.

      The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab prolongs Overall Survival (OS) compared
      to paclitaxel and that pembrolizumab prolongs Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) assessed by blinded central
      radiologists' review compared to paclitaxel.
