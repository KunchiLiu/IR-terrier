  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving immune cells
      called natural killer (NK) cells with chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant to patients
      with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Participants will receive an autologous stem cell transplant (a
      transplant of participant's own bone marrow or blood cells).

      NK cells may kill cancer cells that remain in participant's body after participant's last
      chemotherapy treatment. The NK cells will be separated from a donor's umbilical cord blood.
      These separated NK cells will then be grown in the lab to increase the number of NK cells
      that can be given to participant by vein. If certain types of unwanted T cells are growing
      too much, an investigational device called a CliniMACS system will be used to filter out the
      unwanted T cells using a magnet.

      Chemotherapy, NK, and Stem Cell Infusions:

      In a stem cell transplant, the days before participant receives stem cells are called minus
      days. The day they receive the stem cells is called Day 0. The days after they receive the
      stem cells are called plus days.

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, on Day -13, participant will receive
      rituximab by vein over about 3 hours, if participant is receiving it. This will depend on
      the disease that participant has. Participant will then be admitted to the hospital and will
      receive hydration fluids by vein.

      On Day -12, participant will receive carmustine by vein over about 2 hours.

      On Days -11 through -8, participant will receive etoposide by vein over about 3 hours and
      cytarabine by vein over 1 hour.

      On Day -7, participant will receive melphalan by vein over about 30 minutes. Participant
      will receive rituximab by vein over about 3 hours, if participant is receiving it.

      On Days -7 through -2 participant will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time a day. Participant
      should swallow lenalidomide capsules whole with water at the same time each day. Participant
      should not break, chew, or open the capsules.

      If participant misses a dose of lenalidomide, participant should take it as soon as
      participant remembers on the same day. If participant misses taking participant's dose for
      the entire day, participant should take participant's regular dose the next scheduled day.
      Participant should not take double participant's regular dose to make up for the missed
      dose. If participant takes more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide, participant should
      seek emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff right away.

      On Day -5, participant will receive the NK cells by vein over about 1 hour.

      On Day 0, participant will receive the stem cell transplant by vein over about 30-60
      minutes.

      Starting on Day +5, participant will receive filgrastim (G-CSF) through a needle under the
      skin 1 time a day every day until participant's white blood cell count begins to recover.
      Filgrastim is designed to help cells in the bone marrow to multiply, which helps to raise
      white blood cell counts more quickly, lower fever, and decrease the risk of infection.

      Participant will receive standard antibiotics to help lower the risk of infection.
      Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their
      risks.

      Study Visits:

      Before participant starts treatment, the following tests/procedures will be performed if
      they were not done within the last 30 days:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and to
           check for infectious diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis. Within 10-14 days before
           lenalidomide is prescribed, and again within 24 hours before lenalidomide is
           prescribed, participant will have a blood pregnancy test if participant can become
           pregnant. These blood tests will be part of a routine blood draw. Participant must fill
           the lenalidomide prescription within 7 days after it is prescribed. To take part in
           this study, participant cannot be pregnant.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have an EKG and either an echocardiogram (ECHO) or a MUGA scan to
           check participant's heart function.

        -  Participant will have scans to check the status of the disease. This will include a
           series of x-rays (a bone survey) and a chest x-ray, and a PET/CT scan. If participant's
           doctor thinks it is needed, participant will also have MRIs of their brain.

        -  Participant will have lung function tests.

        -  Participant will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the
           disease. To collect a bone marrow aspiration, an area of the hip or other site is
           numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone and bone marrow is withdrawn through
           a large needle.

      Up to twice a week from Day -4 to Day +7, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check
      for donor NK cells, if they are one of the first 12 participants enrolled in this study. If
      donor NK cells are found, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn 1 time each week until
      around Day +30 (+/-3 days). From 30 to about 100 days after the stem cell transplant, this
      blood will be drawn only if participant had NK cells in their blood at the last blood draw
      and participant is having a routine follow-up visit.

      At each visit after the NK cell infusion on Day -5, or as often as participant's study
      doctor thinks it is needed, participant will be checked for possible reactions to the
      transplant and study drugs, including graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a condition
      in which transplanted tissue attacks the transplant recipient's body. Graft failure occurs
      when transplanted stem cells may not be able to grow and multiply in participant's body. If
      this happens, there will be a high risk of infections and/or bleeding. If the number of
      white blood cells does not get back to high enough levels within 3 weeks after the
      transplant, more stem cells may need to be given. The study doctor will discuss this with
      participant.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      About 28 days after participant's last lenalidomide dose, if participant can become
      pregnant, participant will have a pregnancy test. This blood test will be part of a blood
      draw as part of their standard care.

      At about 30 and 100 days after the stem cell transplant:

        -  Participant will have PET/CT and/or CT scans to check the status of the disease.

        -  If participant's study doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow
           aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      As often as the doctor thinks is needed through Day 100, blood (about 4 teaspoons) and/or
      urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Length of Study:

      Participant will remain in this study for 100 days after the stem cell transplant.
      Participation on this study will be over when participant has completed the long-term
      follow-up visits.

      This is an investigational study. The way researchers process the NK cells is
      investigational. It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      The combination of a stem cell transplant and the study drugs is FDA approved and
      commercially available to be given to patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      The study doctor can explain how the study therapy is designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
