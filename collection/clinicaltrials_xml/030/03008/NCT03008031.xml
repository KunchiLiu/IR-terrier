  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal dose of iodine based contrast agents used in contrast-enhanced spectral
      mammography (CESM) is unknown. If CESM, performed with lower dose of iodine based contrast
      agent, visualizes a tumor comparable to CESM with regular dose of contrast agent, patients
      can receive less contrast agent for CESM in future and thereby risking less side effects of
      the contrast agent.

      In order to study whether CESM remains unchanged at smaller amounts of contrast
      administration, a second CESM exam will be performed within one week of the first with a an
      alternative amount of contrast, it being either 80%, 60% or 40% of the original contrast
      dose. The settings of the CESM unit will remain unchanged.
