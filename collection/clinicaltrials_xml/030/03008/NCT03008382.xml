  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) afflicts 3 to 8 million women in the
      US. Symptoms of IC/BPS reduce quality of life, suppressing both social well-being and
      physical function. The chronic pain, voiding dysfunction, sleep deprivation and associated
      co-morbid conditions interfere with relationships and employment with significant direct
      (doctor visits, medication, surgery) and indirect (loss of productivity) economic impact,
      currently exceeding $100 million per year.This proposal aims to move the science of chronic
      pelvic pain (CPP) from simple associations towards an investigation of cause and effect
      relationships. The investigators will determine whether the striking changes in autonomic
      nervous system responsiveness (ANS-R) contribute meaningfully to the pathogenesis of IC/BPS.

             symptoms must be excluded, particularly recurrent UTI

          -  MPP - ≥3 months of non-cyclic continuous pelvic pain unrelated to bladder state and a
             minimum of 2 of 5 examined pelvic floor TPs scoring at least 4 out of 10 on a numeric
             rating scale using 2 kg pressure applied with the index finger

          -  Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:
