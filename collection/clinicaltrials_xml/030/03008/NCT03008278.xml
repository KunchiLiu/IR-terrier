      This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of olaparib when given
      together with ramucirumab and how well they work in treating patients with gastric or
      gastroesophageal junction cancer that has spread to other places in the body, has come back,
      or cannot be removed by surgery. Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ramucirumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving olaparib and
      ramucirumab may work better in treating patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safe dose of olaparib with ramucirumab, but not to exceed olaparib dose
      of 300 mg twice daily (tablet formulation). (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of
      olaparib plus ramucirumab as measured by the objective response rate (ORR). (Phase II).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate median progression-free survival (PFS). II. To estimate median overall
      survival (OS). III. To measure the prevalence of the BROCA-HR biomarker in our study
      population.

      IV. To determine toxicity of olaparib and ramucirumab combination. V. To evaluate the
      effects of this regimen on quality of life scores by European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the correlation between the Myriad homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)
      assay results, the signature 3 status, and mutations in BROCA-HR panel.

      II. To evaluate the association between findings from BROCA-HR panel, the Myriad HRD assay,
      and signature 3 results with response to therapy.

      III. To determine results of immunoassay for poly-ADP-ribosylated (PAR) substrates in tumor
      tissue.

      IV. To create a PDX model to study DNA repair in gastric tumors treated with PARP inhibitors
      (PARPi) from both pre-treatment biopsy and repeat biopsy after 16 weeks of treatment.

      V. Biobank additional tumor tissue for future genomic analysis. VI. Biobank peripheral blood
      for future genomic analysis and assessment of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of olaparib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and ramucirumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 6
      weeks thereafter.
