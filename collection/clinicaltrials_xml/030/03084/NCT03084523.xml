  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular disease is a major source of neural injury and there is an urgent need for
      comprehensive evaluation of these patients. High-resolution MRI (HR-MRI) allows direct
      visualization of intracranial vessel wall pathology in the setting of acute ischemic stroke
      and intracranial aneurysm (intracranial aneurysm rupture.Vessel wall enhancement on HR-MRI
      results from inflammation and has considerable potential as a marker of future stroke risk
      or aneurysm rupture. The investigator(s) have successfully developed and employed an
      intracranial HR-MRI protocol to identify vessel-wall enhancement in over 130 patients during
      the past year; however, with our finalized protocol there is a current lack of data on
      HR-MRI interrater reliability, vessel-wall enhancement prevalence in both symptomatic and
      asymptomatic patients, and the local and systemic inflammation underpinning vessel-wall
      enhancement pathophysiology. The unmet need is a study validating HR-MRI reliability and the
      association of vessel-wall enhancement with both symptomatic and pro-inflammatory status in
      patients with cerebrovascular disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial atherosclerosis accounts for 10 to 40%, depending on ethnicity, of the 700,000
      ischemic strokes in the United States every year.The annual rate of recurrent stroke in
      patients with optimally treated Intracranial atherosclerosis remains more than twice the
      average of other stroke etiologies (12.5% vs. 5%).Intracranial aneurysm ruptured affects up
      to 30,000 Americans every year and 50% of patients die within a month of intracranial
      aneurysm rupture.7 A robust literature has established that HR-MRI of extracranial carotid
      vessel wall enhancement can predict stroke, independent of stenosis. Vessel wall enhancement
      has been reported in symptomatic Intracranial atherosclerosis and intracranial aneurysm but
      the role of local and systemic inflammation is unknown. Inflammatory biomarkers are elevated
      in symptomatic extracranial atherosclerosis and in unstable intracranial aneurysm, but the
      association with HR-MRI findings in Intracranial atherosclerosis and intracranial aneurysm
      has not yet been explored.Vessel wall enhancement is typically demonstrated by the uptake of
      gadolinium MRI contrast into the aneurysm wall or atherosclerotic plaque. A novel MRI
      contrast agent, ferumoxytol, allows multicontrast weighting on T1w and T2w images and
      provides important insight into the role of local vessel wall inflammation by accumulating
      in macrophages on delayed T2* sequences.

      To identify effective prevention and treatment strategies for cerebrovascular disease, the
      investigator(s) need to critically evaluate HR-MRI techniques, determine vessel wall
      enhancement prevalence, and explore the link between vessel wall enhancement and
      inflammation. The investigator(s) hypothesize that vessel wall enhancement is reliable,
      associated with symptomatic Intracranial atherosclerosis/intracranial aneurysm and higher
      levels of inflammatory biomarkers. In order to answer our hypotheses, the investigator(s)
      propose a pilot study on 40 participants. The investigator(s) will opportunistically enroll
      participants who receive standard of care HR-MRI with gadolinium contrast or perform a
      baseline HR-MRI with gadolinium if needed. All participants will have 2 study HR-MRIs (0 and
      72 hours) using ferumoxytol contrast. The investigator(s) will analyze two groups of
      participants (20 with intracranial atherosclerosis and 20 with intracranial aneurysms) with
      10 asymptomatic and 10 symptomatic participants in both groups.
