  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, study to determine safety of fixed doses of durvalumab
      1500 mg and tremelimumab 75mg combination therapy or durvalumab 1500 mg monotherapy in
      participants with advanced solid malignancies. The core study (and each tumor specific
      module) consists of a screening period, a treatment period, a safety follow-up period and a
      survival follow-up period. The study is planned to determine the short and long term safety
      including evaluation of nature of toxicities (AEs, adverse events of special interest
      (AESIs), SAEs, immune-mediated adverse events [imAEs]), interventions / treatment, and
      outcomes of treatment of these. Please note: initially this study will only recruit patients
      with urothelial and non-urothelial urinary tract cancer.

      Participants will receive either durvalumab and tremelimumab (combination therapy) or
      durvalumab (monotherapy) depending on tumor specific module. Please note: initially this
      study will only recruit patients with urothelial and non-urothelial urinary tract cancer.

Participants will receive durvalumab monotherapy in those modules of the study protocol for which monotherapy is the defined treatment regimen.
COMBINATION THERAPY
In those modules of the study protocol for which combination therapy is the defined treatment regimen, participants will receive durvalumab plus tremelimumab followed by: Durvalumab monotherapy every 4 weeks (Q4W), starting 4 weeks after the last infusion of the combination or discontinuation of tremelimumab.
Participants will receive monotherapy or combination therapy depending on the module of study protocol.</description>
