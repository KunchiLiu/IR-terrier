  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cellular lysates from purified protein derivative-positive donors have been reported to
      transfer tuberculin reactivity to na(SqrRoot) ve recipients, but not diphtheria reactivity;
      similarly, cell lysates from diphtheria-reactive donors appear to transfer diphtheria
      reactivity without impacting responses to tuberculin. A historically controversial topic,
      the terms transfer factor and dialyzed leukocyte extract were used to characterize the
      reactivity-transferring properties of lysates. We found that the cellular extract derived
      from antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells induces interleukin (IL)-6 from antigen-matched
      antigen-presenting cells. This ultimately elicits IL-17 from bystander memory CD8+ T cells.
      We identified that dialyzable peptide sequences, S100a9, and the TCR &lt;= chain from CD8+ T
      cells contribute to the molecular nature of this activity. We further showed that extracts
      from antigen-targeted T cells enhance immunity to Staphylococcus aureus and Candida
      albicans. The observed anti-Candida activity of lysates was enhanced when the cells were
      taken from individuals with higher-than-average exposure to Candida and correlated with
      increased numbers of Candida-reactive T-cells. These effects are sensitive to immunization
      protocols and extraction methodology in ways that may explain past discrepancies in the
      reproducibility of passive cellular immunity. Work by other groups has revealed that memory
      CD8+ T cells are also the only cell population enriched in breast milk as compared to an
      equal volume of peripheral blood. Taken together, it may be that the CD8+ memory T cells in
      breast milk serve as a mechanism of passive cellular immunity transference from mother to
      offspring. We thus aim to expand our analysis into the potential that lysates taken from
      sources with enriched immunity against a given microorganism will induce greater in vivo and
      mouse model activity compared to lysates from non-immune sources, and that this difference
      in lysate activity will be directly related to the CD8+ T cell enrichment.

      In this study, we will collect blood and/or breast milk samples from donors with known or
      suspected exposure to pathogens, and also from healthy non-exposed volunteers. Research
      evaluations of samples will be done for the relevant microbe(s) of interest. The volume of
      blood taken from lacting mothers will be limited to 20mL or less per visit. Cells may be
      proliferated, immortalized, lysed and dialyzed, and/or stored. Cellular lysates will
      subsequently be used in both in vitro and pre-clinical animal models to assess for
      therapeutic potential.

                  OR

                  -Clinical history is consistent with established epidemiology of the microbe of
                  interest (eg, documentation of past infection; or to a lesser priority travel to
                  endemic areas or living with an individual that suffers from chronic infection
                  with the targeted microbe).

                  AND

                  -Positive results on established clinical immunity tests (eg, viral RNA,
                  antibody titers, etc).

               2. Suspected exposure: Clinical history is consistent with established epidemiology
                  of the microbe of interest (eg, travel to endemic areas, documentation of past
                  infection) but no established clinical assay exists to verify exposure.

               3. Non-exposed: Absence of exposure to targeted microorganisms as measured by lack
                  of exposure to infected individuals, lack of travel to endemic areas, no
                  immunization history, negative screening tests, or other methods of establishing
                  exposure history to mucosal microbial agents.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Active use of immunosuppressive medications.

          2. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates participation
             in this study.
