  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose-response of different doses of CHF 781
      pMDI on lung function and other clinical outcomes, to identify the optimal dose(s) in terms
      of benefit/ risk ratio for further development in the target patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled
      dose ranging 5-arm parallel group study to identify the optimal dose of CHF 781 pMDI with
      respect to lung function and other clinical efficacy and safety outcomes.

      After a 2 week run-in period under rescue albuterol as needed and background inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS), patients will be randomized to one of the 5 study treatment groups.
      After randomization, patients will be assessed after 4 and 8 weeks of study treatment at the
      center. A follow-up phone call will be performed a week after the last visit.

      During the study, daily asthma symptoms, peak expiratory flow, rescue and background
      medication use, and compliance with the study medication will be recorded via subject diary.
      Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be assessed and recorded throughout the
      study. At screening and subsequent visits, patients will undergo physical and vital signs
      examinations, spirometry measurements, and 12-lead ECG. Routine hematology, blood chemistry,
      and pregnancy testing will be performed before enrollment and at end of study. 24-hr urine
      cortisol and creatinine will be assessed before and after the first dose and just before the
      last dose of study treatment.
