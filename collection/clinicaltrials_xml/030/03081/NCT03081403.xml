  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensitive skin is a common problem, with 50% of women and 30% of men in Europe feel they
      have sensitive skin.

      The Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a physico-psychic method that uses gradients
      stimuli of different modalities to measure a subjective somatosensory response. This allows
      to characterize sensory dysfunction by assessing the participation of small and large nerve
      fibers.

      The aim of this project is to characterize the presence or absence of a neurological
      disorder in patients with sensitive skin. This discovery would be a decisive argument to
      reinforce the suspicion that sensitive skins is linked to a small fiber neuropathy.

      Sensitive skin is a common problem, with 50% of women and 30% of men in Europe feel they
      have sensitive skin. A sensitive skin is characterized by the occurrence of tingling
      sensations, tightness, heat, burning, itching or pain triggered by non pathogenic factors
      such as wind, heat, cold, water , cosmetics, toiletries, stress...
