  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent spontaneous abortion(RSA) and repeated implantation failure (RIF) during IVF-ET
      severely affects IVF live birth rate and patient's health.The specific etiology contains
      chromosomal abnormalities, reproductive anatomical abnormalities, endocrine disorders,
      reproductive system infections, autoimmune and environmental factors. However there are
      still 50% to 60% RSA which don't have a clear cause, called unexplained recurrent
      spontaneous abortion (URSA), mainly related to immune factors.Among various
      treatments,lymphocytes active immunotherapy is the most common treatment method, and its
      clinical efficacy is widely recognized although its action mechanism is not clear so far.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main mechanism of active immunotherapy includes upregulating Th2-type cytokines,
      downregulating Th1-type cytokines, making Th1 / Th2 shift to Th2, inducing maternal serum
      IL-6 and sIL6R, PIBF, EGF; inducing the expression of Fas / Fasl on lymphocyte surface;
      increasing the proportion of CD8 + cells, Th2-type cells and CD + CD25 + Treg cells,
      decreasing the activity of CD56 + CD16 + NK cell and so on.The purpose of this study is to
      observe the treatment effects of active immunotherapy on RSA and RIF patients. What's
      more,we will used flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods to
      characterize Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg cell populations after immunotherapy,ecpecting to find
      out the exact molecule mechanism of immunotherapy with paternal or third party lymphocytes.

    <description>Donor (husband or third party) lymphocytes were prepared by Ficoll-Paque centrifugation; the cells were washed with sterile saline and resuspended in 1 ml at a concentration of 20-40 Ã— 106 cells/ml. The cells were given to the female partner by 4-6 intradermal injected. In this study, the lymphocyte immunization therapies were performed every 3 weeks for 3 times. After that we test Th1/Th2/Treg, if they become normal, the patients can prepare for pregnancy.</description>
