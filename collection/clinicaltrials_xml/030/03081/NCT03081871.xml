  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risk factors for cardiovascular disease are poorly controlled even for patients who
      frequently visit their physician, leading to large numbers of preventable cardiovascular
      events such as heart attacks and strokes. Research from integrated healthcare systems
      suggests that risk factors can be controlled better and treatment strategies for
      cardiovascular disease can be markedly improved by using a centralized cardiovascular risk
      service (CVRS) managed by pharmacists. We are confident that a pharmacist-managed mHealth
      CVRS can become a strategy in un-integrated healthcare settings to markedly reduce
      cardiovascular events in the United States.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes 2,200 deaths in Americans every day with one death every
      39 seconds. There is evidence that these deaths can be prevented with better risk factor
      management, however, many risk factors remain uncontrolled. The Patient-Centered Medical
      Home (Medical Home) which includes self-management, personalized health records and
      team-based care, has been proposed as a strategy to reduce these gaps in care delivery.
      Several Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses have found evidence that adding pharmacists to
      the primary care team improves risk factor control and physician adherence to guidelines.
      Managed care organizations have found that a centralized cardiovascular risk service (CVRS)
      managed by pharmacists can reduce mortality. A gap in the literature is that it is not known
      whether a comprehensive CVRS model would be implemented in typical office practices in
      un-integrated settings. Simultaneously, systematic reviews of mobile health (mHealth) trials
      including disease management apps have found no trial that has incorporated communication
      with a pharmacist and this lack of evidence is a major gap in the mHealth literature.

      The objective of this application is to develop and test a mobile app enabled, pharmacist
      managed CVRS for disseminating and implementing evidence-based guidelines in practice. In
      addition to developing the app with patients as design partners, we will conduct a
      multi-center individually randomized study nested within an ongoing NIH trial in medical
      offices with large geographic, racial and ethnic diversity. We will randomize 100 patients
      from primary care offices to mHealth CVRS (mobile app + web site + pharmacist) or to CVRS
      only (web site + pharmacist) of whom 55 will be from racial/ethnic minorities. Our central
      hypothesis is that the mHealth CVRS designed with patients as partners will be implemented
      and significantly improve patient engagement, leading to improved CVD guideline adherence
      using the Get with The Guidelines and Guideline Advantage metrics. The rationale for this
      proposed study is that a novel mHealth model that improves secondary prevention of CVD with
      pharmacist assistance will lead to broader adoption by health systems throughout the US.

      Our primary Aim is: to examine the feasibility of mHealth technology to disseminate
      evidence-based risk reduction guidelines in a prospective randomized controlled trial among
      diverse primary care offices. We postulate that system engagement (primary hypothesis) and
      adherence to guidelines for secondary prevention of CVD (secondary hypothesis) will be
      significantly greater in patients randomized to the mHealth intervention compared to the
      control group.

      This study is expected to produce the following outcomes: unique mobile app features that
      complement the standard CVRS, increased engagement with a CVRS and increased achievement of
      guideline-concordant therapy.

    <description>CVRS pharmacists will access the study database including patient baseline information obtained from the medical record and patient entered data to make their assessments and recommendations to onsite physicians and onsite clinical pharmacists and individualize their communication with patients. The intervention will provide patient-centered counseling and education to improve medication adherence, lifestyle modifications and/or smoking cessation. The CVRS pharmacist does not make changes to therapy independently but, rather, provides the physicians and on-site pharmacists with action plans and status updates about adherence to Guideline metrics, which should markedly reduce the gaps in guideline-concordant therapy that place patients at risk for CVD events.</description>

    <ipd_description>Public use data sets will be created and made available to other investigators in a timely manner. Data will only be provided in the form of fully HIPAA-de-identified datasets. Data sets will be carefully reviewed to make sure that information such as age and gender cannot be used to gather additional information that could potentially identify individual subjects. All categorical demographic variables will be collapsed into categories large enough so that combinations of demographic categories for age, gender or area of residence will have 10 or more individuals in each cell. We plan to create SAS datasets in transport format and provide data dictionaries describing the contents of each dataset. Investigators requesting access to the data will be asked to complete a data sharing agreement.</ipd_description>
