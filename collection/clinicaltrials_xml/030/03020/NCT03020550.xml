  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study measuring physiologic and behavioral correlates of symptom severity in
      adult patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will complete questionnaires regarding their GERD-related symptoms and have a visit
      with a study clinician regarding their symptoms. We will measure heart rate variability and
      galvanic skin response in patients during the visits and video record the visits. Subjects
      will complete a daily GERD symptom diary for 2 weeks and then return to the study center to
      complete additional questionnaires and an exit interview.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults ages 21-70 years old

          -  Heartburn symptoms 3 or more days per week with an average daily symptom severity of
             3 or more on a 7 day baseline symptom diary

          -  English language proficiency

          -  Willingness to be videotaped and connected to physiologic monitoring devices during
             the visit

          -  Diagnosis of Crohn's disease, systemic sclerosis, known active ulcer disease, gastric
             cancer, or untreated/active Barrett's esophagitis based on subject self-report and/or
             medical record review

          -  Heavy alcohol use (&gt; 6 drinks/week for women and &gt; 13 drinks/week for men)

          -  Pregnant women.
