    <textblock>
      Individuals receiving dialysis are at risk of heart failure and heart related death. There
      is an urgent need for treatments that reduce the risk of these problems in patients that
      require dialysis.

      Spironolactone is a pill used to prevent heart failure and related deaths in patients that
      do not require dialysis. It works by blocking a hormone (aldosterone) in your body that
      causes high blood pressure and can damage the heart. Although spironolactone is very
      effective in patients that do not require dialysis, we do not know if spironolactone is
      effective in dialysis patients. Our research will help determine if spironolactone reduces
      heart failure and heart related deaths in dialysis patients.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if spironolactone reduces death or hospitalization
      for heart failure and is well tolerated in patients that require dialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, over 2 million people receive dialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and
      650,000 new patients start dialysis each year. Furthermore, the number of patients receiving
      dialysis is increasing as access to dialysis in the developing world improves and the
      prevalence of diabetes and vascular disease rises. Despite technical advances in dialysis,
      the outcomes for patients with ESRD are poor. Patients have frequent hospitalizations, poor
      health related quality of life and strikingly, high mortality rates.

      The most common cause of death in patients receiving dialysis is cardiovascular disease,
      accounting for &gt;40% of all deaths. Observational studies suggest a causal pathway to
      cardiovascular death that includes progressive ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation as
      well as accelerated atherosclerosis. These changes result in myocardial ischemia and cardiac
      fibrosis that, in turn, lead to heart failure, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Strongly
      implicated in this pathophysiology is aldosterone. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
      (MRAs) in non-ESRD patients, prevent cardiovascular deaths and small randomized controlled
      trials of MRAs in ESRD suggests they may reduce death and may be safe.

      Spironolactone is the most commonly used MRA worldwide. We will conduct a multicentre
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine if spironolactone reduces cardiac mortality
      and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients treated with dialysis. This trial is
      called the Aldosterone bloCkade for Health Improvement EValuation in End-stage renal disease
      (ACHIEVE).
