  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant ascites is a severe complication of many types of human cancer. Animal and
      clinical analyses have shown that angiogenesis plays a critical role in the formation of
      malignant ascites. Therefore, drugs such as apatinib that target angiogenesis may control
      the development of malignant ascites. The study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      apatinib in patients with refractory malignant ascites.

      The study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with refractory
      malignant ascites. Patients with performance status 0 or 1 were assigned to 850mg group and
      patients with performance status 2 were assigned to 500mg group continually until disease
      progression or intolerable toxicity or patients withdrawal of consent, and the sample size
      is 120 individuals.
