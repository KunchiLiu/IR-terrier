  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3389404 is being developed for the treatment of CHB virus infection. The development goal
      for GSK3389404 is the establishment of a finite duration treatment that results in sustained
      suppression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and viral antigen production after
      cessation of all treatments for CHB due to the restoration of a functional immune response
      in the absence of high antigen levels. This study is a multicenter, randomized double-Blind
      (sponsor un-blinded in Part 1), Placebo-controlled Study which will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, and PD profile of GSK3389404 in subjects with CHB and aim to establish
      proof-of-mechanism. The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 will be conducted as a
      single ascending dose (SAD) study with 5 planned cohorts ranging from 30 milligram (mg) to a
      maximum of 240 mg GSK3389404. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized to receive
      either GSK3389404 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Cohorts A, B, C, C1, and D will be conducted in
      a sequential fashion; Cohort C1 may be dosed after Cohort C or in parallel with Cohort D.
      Part 2 will be conducted as a multiple-dose, dose-ranging study. Subjects will be randomized
      to different parallel dose levels and regimens or placebo. The dose levels of Part 2 will be
      selected after a review of Part 1 safety but will not exceed a total monthly dose of 480 mg.
      However, the total monthly subcutaneous (SC) dose of 480 mg will only be explored in a once
      weekly or bi-weekly (every 2 weeks) dosing regimen. The total study duration for part 1
      including screening, treatment, and post-treatment follow-up, will not be expected to exceed
      13 weeks for each subject and for part 2, including screening, treatment and post-treatment
      follow-up, will not be expected to exceed 29 weeks for each subject.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration: Part 1: ALT &lt; 5 X Upper Limit of Normal
             (ULN). Part 2: ALT &lt;=ULN.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical history: History of or active diagnosis of liver disease other than CHB, such
             as autoimmune hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non alcoholic
             steatohepatitis, hemochromatosis, or liver failure. History or other clinical
             evidence of hypertension, significant or unstable cardiac disease (e.g., prolonged QT
             syndrome [torsade de pointes], angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction, diastolic dysfunction, significant arrhythmia, coronary heart disease
             and/or clinically significant ECG abnormalities). Uncontrolled or history of
             difficult to control hypertension. History of, or active diagnosis of, primary or
             secondary renal disease (e.g., renal disease secondary to diabetes, hypertension,
             vascular disease, etc.). History of extrahepatic disorders possibly related to HBV
             immune complexes (e.g., glomerulonephritis and polyarteritis nodosa). History of
             bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. History of or suspected presence of vasculitis.
             History of Gilbert's Syndrome. History of malignancy within the past 5 years with the
             exception of specific cancers that are cured by surgical resection (e.g., skin
             cancer), subjects under evaluation for possible malignancy are not eligible.

          -  History of/sensitivity to GSK3389404 or components thereof or a history of drug or
             other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor,
             contraindicates their participation.

          -  Confirmed or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as evidenced by:
             Alpha-fetoprotein concentration &gt;=200 nanogram (ng)/mL. If the screening
             alpha-fetoprotein concentration is &gt;=50 ng/mL and &lt;200 ng/mL, the absence of liver
             mass must be documented by imaging within 6 months before randomization.

          -  Liver cirrhosis or evidence of cirrhosis as determined by any of the following:
             Positive liver biopsy (i.e., Metavir Score F4) within 12 months of screening.
             Fibroscan &gt;12 kilopascals (kPa) within 12 months of screening. AST-Platelet Index
             (APRI) &gt;2 and FibroSure result &gt;0.7 within 12 months of screening. For subjects
             without a test for cirrhosis in the above timeframes, APRI and FibroSure should be
             performed during the screening period to rule out cirrhosis.

          -  A positive Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibody test.

          -  A positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody test.

          -  Positive Hepatitis D Virus (HDV) antibody test.

          -  Laboratory results as follows: Total bilirubin concentration &gt;1.25 X ULN. Serum
             albumin concentration &lt;3.5 grams (g)/deciliter (dL). International normalized ratio
             (INR) &gt;1.25. Platelet count &lt;140 X 10^9/L. Serum creatinine concentration greater
             than the ULN. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt;90 mL/min as calculated by the
             Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiologic Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula. Subjects with
             GFR &lt;90 mL/min but &gt;= 80 mL/min may be considered after consultation with the
             GlaxoSmithKline medical monitor. Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR)&gt;=0.03 mg/mg.
             In the event of an ACR above this threshold, eligibility may be confirmed by a second
             measurement.

          -  Positive test for blood in urine. In the event of a positive test, the test may be
             repeated once, and if repeat is negative or if urine microscopy reveals &lt;5 RBC per
             High-Power Field (HPF), the subject is considered eligible.

          -  Fridericia's QT correction formula (QTcF) &gt;=450 milliseconds (msec) (mean of
             triplicate measurements).

          -  Currently taking, or took within 3 months of screening, any immunosuppressing drugs
             (e.g., prednisone), other than a short course of therapy (&lt;=2 weeks).

          -  Current alcohol use as judged by investigator to potentially interfere with
             participant compliance.

          -  A positive pre-study treatment screen or an unwillingness to refrain from use of the
             illicit drugs and adhere to other protocol-stated restrictions while participating in
             the study.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 5 half-lives (if known) or twice the duration (if known) of the biological
             effect of the study treatment (whichever is longer) or 90 days (if half-life or
             duration is unknown).

          -  Prior treatment with any oligonucleotide or small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA)
             (siRNA) within 12 months prior to the first dosing day.
