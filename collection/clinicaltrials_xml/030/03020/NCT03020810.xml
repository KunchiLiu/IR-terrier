  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single patient expanded access, compassionate and non-emergency use study that
      provides patients with severe asthma, who do not qualify for ongoing clinical trials with
      dupilumab, access to this investigational treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being undertaken to determine whether dupilumab has efficacy in extremely
      severe asthma, and to allow a very severe asthma patient, who has been tried on nearly every
      immunosuppressive drug, early access to a potentially effective therapy.

      The patient will continue in the study indefinitely. Safety will be evaluated and serious
      adverse events will be reported.
