  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia can affect tissue oxygen saturation and microcirculatory reactivity.
      However, the differences in microcirculation caused by anesthetic methods have not been well
      studied. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures peripheral tissue oxygen saturation
      noninvasively and can be used in conjunction with vascular occlusion (VOT) experiments. The
      purpose of this study was to examine the changes in NIRS derived tissue oxygen saturation
      (StO2) and microcirculatory reactivity by VOT after inhalation anesthesia in healthy
      population.

      This prospective, observational study will be performed on 57 healthy patients who had
      undergone elective surgery under volatile general anesthesia. The investigators measure StO2
      and microvascular reactivity using NIRS combined with vascular occlusion test (VOT). The
      parameters were performed twice per patient, before and after the induction of anesthesia.

      Occlusion slope and recovery slope during VOT will be compared before and after anesthesia.
      Moreover, the changes depend on the age will be analyzed.
