      This is an active surveillance study to monitor the real world safety of nintedanib in
      Indian patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. The safety of nintedanib has been
      assessed in clinical trials. Since only 20 patients from India were enrolled in the INPULSIS
      trials, the safety data on Indian patients is limited. In this active surveillance, the
      safety of nintedanib in IPF patients will be examined in Indian real world setting
