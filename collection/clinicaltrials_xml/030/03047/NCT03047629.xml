  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of an orally-administered medication to relieve symptoms of constipation
      associated with Parkinson's Disease. Ten patients will be enrolled in Phase 1, and will be
      studied over an 8-12 week period. Forty patients will be enrolled in Phase 2, and will be
      studied over an 8-10 week period. All subjects will receive the study drug during one of the
      observational periods of the study.

      Phase 1 will enroll 10 patients to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      single escalating doses over a 30-60 day period. The dose-escalation period will be preceded
      by a 2-week run in period and followed by a 2-week wash-out period.

      Phase 2 follow the safe completion of Phase 1. It will enroll 40 patients and is composed of
      4 periods of study: 1) a 2-week run-in period, 2) a 3-5 week escalating dose period to
      identify a prokinetic dose in the initial set of 10 patients, 3) a 1-week period of
      randomized dosing (placebo versus the previously identified pro-kinetic dose), and 4) a
      2-week wash-out period. Pharmacodynamics will be assessed along with safety and
      tolerability. Relative outcomes will be compared within each patient and across groups for
      the randomized dosing period.

      Frequency of bowel movements and other non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease will be
      collected over the course of both phases.
