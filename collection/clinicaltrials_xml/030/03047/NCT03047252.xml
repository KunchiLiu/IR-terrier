  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel kinematic biofeedback system
      - SWORD Phoenix- in the rehabilitation after total knee replacement .

      SWORD Phoenix allows the patients to perform independent rehabilitation sessions at home,
      under remote monitoring from the clinical team.

      The investigators hypothesize that the clinical outcomes of a home-based rehabilitation
      program will be at least similar to the outcomes of a traditional home-based rehabilitation
      with face-to-face sessions.

      This is a randomized controlled trial with active comparator. Patients will be enrolled and
      randomized pre-operatively into 2 groups: intervention group and control group. Both groups
      will perform 8 weeks of rehabilitation starting on day 7 after surgery.

      The intervention group will perform daily rehabilitation sessions at home using SWORD
      Phoenix, under remote monitoring from a physical therapist. The control group will perform
      1h rehabilitation sessions 3 times a week, at home, given by a physical therapist.

      Outcomes will be measured at weeks 4 and 8. The primary outcome is the performance in the
      Timed-up-and-Go (TUG) test between in each patient in comparison with the pre-operative
      score. Secondary outcomes will be measured in term of: a) range of motion of the knee joint
      (flexion/extension); b) Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score); c) quality of life, as measured
      by the SF-36 scale.

    <description>SWORD Phoenix will be used independently by the patients to perform rehabilitation sessions at home, under remote monitoring from the clinical team. A tailored rehabilitation program will be prescribed, based on the following principles:
STAGE 1 (Weeks 0-2) Open kinetic chain exercises without added resistance: lying, sitting and standing (with support) Strengthening of hip flexors and extensors Ice pack application after each session and throughout the day as needed STAGE 2 (weeks 3-6) Open kinetic chain exercises with added resistance, progressing to closed kinetic chain exercises, with strengthening of knee flexors and extensors and knee stabilization Progression to standing exercises without support lying, sitting and standing (with support) Exercises with steps Ice pack application after each session and throughout the day as needed STAGE 3 (Weeks 7-8) Eccentric strengthening exercises Exercises involving steps Multi-directional exercises</description>

    <description>Patients will perform 3 weekly rehabilitation sessions, with a duration of 1 hour, for 8 weeks, provided by a physical therapist. The rehabilitation program will respect the following principles:
STAGE 1 (Weeks 0-2) Soft tissue massage Active assisted mobilisation of the knee to increase range of motion Gait training with bilateral support Open kinetic chain exercises without added resistance Strengthening of hip flexors and extensors Ice pack application STAGE 2 (weeks 3-6) Soft tissue massage Active assisted mobilisation of the knee to increase range of motion Open kinetic chain exercises with added resistance, progressing to closed kinetic chain exercises, with strengthening of knee flexors/ extensors and knee stabilisation Gait training with progressive withdrawal of external support Ice pack application STAGE 3 (Weeks 7-8) Eccentric strengthening exercises Exercises involving steps Weight-bearing exercises on uneven surfaces Ice pack application</description>
