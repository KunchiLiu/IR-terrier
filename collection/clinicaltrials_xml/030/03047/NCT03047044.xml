  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postoperative pain of lumbar fusion surgery is very severe that it is necessary to use
      additional analgesics as well as a patient controlled analgesia (PCA). The most common pain
      control method of this surgery is the intravenous (IV) PCA. but, if it is relatively
      insufficient amount of narcotic analgesics ,in the case of IV PCA, may be failed to reduce
      the pain intensity effectively. Consequently, it may result in the a lot of rescue
      analgesics requirement, which leads to the adverse effects in patients who are very
      sensitive to narcotic analgesics. In addition, the patient's satisfaction to the PCA may be
      low compared with that of expected. For the recently released PCA instrument 'PAINSTOP', the
      investigators can specify the mode setting including total volume, flow rate (basal rate)
      per hour, bolus dose, and lock out time (LOT). Furthermore, this device can be set to
      optimize basal infusion (B.I), which is a new mode, so that the administered rate and amount
      of drug can be increased or decreased according to the patient's use of bolus button.
      Therefore, this PCA device can be implemented to the conventional mode, and added the
      function of automatically controlling the basal rate and administered amount of drug
      according to the use demand of the patient. However, since there are few studies related to
      this new mode of PCA, more research is needed in patients with postoperative pain.

    <description>In the intervention group, the optimizing B.I PCA mode will be setted. This mode is setted that the amount of administered drug per hour will be increased by 0.4 ml by pressing bolus button (The interval: ~ 6 hr: 60 minutes, 6-18 hr: 90 minutes, 18 hours: 120 minutes). Conversely, if the bolus button is not used for 120 minutes, the administered amount of drug per hour is setted to be reduced by 0.2 ml, and the maximum (or minimum) allowable flow rate is 4 ml (or 1 ml).</description>
