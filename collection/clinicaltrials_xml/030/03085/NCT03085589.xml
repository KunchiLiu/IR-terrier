    <textblock>
      This study aims to adapt a mobile health device (Amulet) for use in older adults. It is the
      second in a series of four research studies whose overarching goal is to conduct a program
      of pilot research aimed at developing and evaluating a technology-assisted wellness
      intervention for older adults with obesity who may or may not live in a rural area.

    <description>The Amulet development team will develop and configure applications assessing: steps/distance; strength; activity type; gait speed; and real-time, self-monitored activity feedback. Objective measures will be validated with the Amulet from 60 participants ensuring usability and feasibility. Each participant will be asked to come into the clinic for one afternoon for about 2-3 hours.</description>
