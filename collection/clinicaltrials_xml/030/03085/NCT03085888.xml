    <textblock>
      GRAIL is using high-intensity sequencing of circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) to
      develop blood tests to detect cancer early. The purpose of this study is to train and
      validate an assay to detect invasive breast cancer in patients undergoing mammography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Detection of early stage cancer may be possible through analysis of circulating cell-free
      nucleic acids (cfNAs) shed into the blood by tumors. GRAIL is using high-intensity
      sequencing (based on broad genomic coverage and deep sequencing) of cfNAs, combined with
      machine learning, to develop blood tests to detect cancer early. The purpose of this
      prospective, multi-center, observational cohort study is to train and validate an assay for
      the early detection of breast cancer. The study will collect blood samples from participants
      within 28 days of their screening mammogram. For participants who receive a cancer diagnosis
      during the study, tissue samples will be collected.

    <description>This is a prospectively enrolling cohort study with a pre-specified molecular analysis plan. A stratified case-cohort design will be employed to select cancer cases and non-cancer subjects who will be assayed. All cases of cancer (breast and non-breast cancer) will be selected. A random subset of the overall study cohort will also be selected.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has an appointment for screening mammography, as referred or recommended by a
             health care provider.

          2. Screening mammogram is received at same facility within 28 days of blood draw (i.e.
             blood may be drawn up to 28 days before or 28 days after the screening mammogram).

          3. Provides informed consent in English or Spanish. Understands the protocol and its
             requirements, risks, and discomforts.

          4. Provides consent to participate in long-term follow-up, such as contact via study
             portal, mail, or phone, for further self-reported information regarding cancer
             diagnoses, change to health plan or residential status, or request for additional
             blood draws and linkage to state state cancer registries and administrative
             databases.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability on the part of the patient to understand the informed consent or be
             compliant with the protocol.

          2. Breast biopsy to evaluate abnormal breast imaging results has occurred prior to a
             planned research blood draw.
