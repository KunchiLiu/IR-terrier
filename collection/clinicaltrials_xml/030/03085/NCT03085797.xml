  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal polyps (NP) has long been known as chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa.
      This disease is characterized by the presence of polyps in the upper nasal cavity,
      originating from within the ostiomeatal complex. The presence of polyps can cause long-term
      symptoms such as prominent nasal obstruction, post-nasal drip, loss of smell, and discharge.

      Mepolizumab (SB240563) is an Immunoglobulin G 1 [IgG1], kappa humanized monoclonal antibody
      (mAB) that blocks human interleukin-5 (hIL-5) from binding to the interleukin-5 (IL-5)
      receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits signaling.
      Neutralization of IL-5 with mepolizumab has been shown to reduce blood, sputum and tissue
      eosinophils and hence is assumed to be a treatment option in a number of eosinophilic
      diseases including NP.

      The aim of this randomized, double-blind, parallel group, phase 3 (PhIII) study is to assess
      the clinical efficacy and safety of 100 milligram (mg) subcutaneous (SC) mepolizumab as an
      add on to maintenance treatment in adults with severe bilateral NP. The study will include a
      4-week run in period followed by randomization to a 52-week treatment period. Participants
      will receive mepolizumab 100 mg or placebo SC by the investigator or delegate via a
      pre-filled safety syringe every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. Throughout the entire study period
      (run in + treatment period + follow up), participants will receive a standard of care (SoC)
      for NP which consists of daily mometasone furorate (MF) nasal spray, and if required, saline
      nasal douching, occasional short courses of high dose oral corticosteroids (OCS) and/or
      antibiotics. The treatment period will consist of thirteen, 4-weekly doses of mepolizumab or
      placebo. In addition, up to the first 200 randomized participants will be followed up every
      other month for up to a further 6 months after the Visit 15 (7 months post last dose) in
      order to assess maintenance of response and to validate a physiological model derived from
      the previous Phase 2 study. Approximately 400 participants will be randomized (200
      participants per treatment arm) in to the study. Total duration of the study will be 76
      weeks for first 200 randomized participants and 52 weeks for remainder of participants who
      are not participating in the 6 months no treatment follow up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in total endoscopic NP score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Each nostril was assessed for polyps and graded at Week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 52. The grading was based on NP size and recorded as the sum of the right and left nostril scores. Total score ranges from 0 to 8; higher scores indicate worse status. Individual score ranges from 0 (no polyps) to 4 (large polyps causing almost complete congestion/ obstruction of the inferior meatus).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in mean nasal obstruction visual analogue scale (VAS) score during the 4 weeks prior to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is an instrument that measures a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. The participant will be asked to indicate on a VAS (0 to 100 units on an electronic device which corresponds to 0 to 10 score) the severity of 5 nasal polyposis symptoms, one VAS for each symptom (1. nasal obstruction; 2. nasal discharge; 3. mucus in the throat; 4. loss of smell; 5. facial pain) and overall VAS symptoms score. The left hand side of the scale (0) represents &quot;None&quot; and the right hand side of the scale (100) represents &quot;As bad as you can imagine&quot;. VAS will be collected daily in morning from screening up to Week 52.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to first nasal surgery up to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>NP surgery is defined as any procedure involving instruments resulting in incision and removal of tissue (polypectomy) or dilatation of the air passages (e.g. balloon sinuplasty) in the nasal cavity. Time to first nasal surgery up to Week 52 will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in mean overall VAS symptom score during the 4 weeks prior to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The mean VAS score over the last 7 days before Visit 2 (Week 0) will be used to determine the Baseline value. The participant will be asked to indicate on a VAS (0 to 100 units on an electronic device which corresponds to 0 to 10 score) the severity of 5 nasal polyposis symptoms, one VAS for each symptom (1. nasal obstruction; 2. nasal discharge; 3. mucus in the throat; 4. loss of smell; 5. facial pain) and overall VAS symptoms score. The left hand side of the scale (0) represents &quot;None&quot; and the right hand side of the scale (100) represents &quot;As bad as you can imagine&quot;. VAS will be collected daily in morning from screening up to Week 52.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT)-22 total score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The SNOT-22 is a health related quality of life questionnaire and has been shown to be a reliable outcome measure for successful septal surgery and in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) management. It is also a tool to evaluate outcomes in nasal polyposis. Participants will be asked to rate the severity of their condition on each of the 22 items over the previous 2 weeks using a 6-point rating scale of 0-5 including: 0 = Not present/no problem; 1 = Very mild problem; 2 = Mild or slight problem; 3 = Moderate problem; 4 = Severe problem; 5 = Problem as &quot;bad as it can be&quot;. The theoretical total score range for the SNOT-22 is 0-110, where lower scores imply less severe symptoms and higher scores representing a worse quality of life. The SNOT-22 questionnaire will be completed by participants at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 52.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of mgs per year of prednisolone-equivalent OCS dose up to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The number of courses of systemic steroids and OCS as well as the dose and duration of the courses will be recorded. The dose for a course of OCS will be according to the participants SoC for OCS use for its NP condition. A course of systemic corticosteroid is considered continuous if treatment is separated by less than 7 days. Various doses of intravenous and oral steroids will be converted to prednisolone-equivalent OCS.</description>
