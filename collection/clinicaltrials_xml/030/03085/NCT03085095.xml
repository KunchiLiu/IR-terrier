      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefit and safety of relugolix 120 mg once
      daily for 48 weeks on maintaining serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels (&lt;=50
      ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L] in patients with androgen-sensitive advanced prostate cancer.

      This study is an international phase 3 randomized, open-label, parallel group efficacy and
      safety study to evaluate oral daily relugolix 120 mg in patients with androgen-sensitive
      advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year (48 weeks) of continuous androgen
      deprivation therapy. Relugolix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide acetate depot
      suspension, 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in some Asian countries), every 3-months (3-M) by
      subcutaneous or intramuscular injection will be administered to patients with prostate
      cancer who require androgen deprivation therapy.

      Approximately 1125 patients will be enrolled in this study. The study includes a Screening
      Period, a Treatment Period of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period. Additionally, unscheduled
      follow-up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study-related safety concerns as
      needed. Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA)
      following local primary intervention with curative intent, newly diagnosed metastatic
      disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and/or advanced localized disease.

      Following successful completion of the Screening period study participants will be
      randomized 2:1 to oral relugolix 120 mg once daily or leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg (or 11.25
      mg in some Asian countries) 3-M depot subcutaneous or intramuscular injection and will
      attend visits monthly (ie, every 4 weeks) where serum testosterone and PSA will be assessed.
      Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, vital signs,
      physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiograms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the
             prostate;

          2. Is a candidate for, in the opinion of the investigator, at least 1 year of continuous
             androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen-sensitive advanced
             prostate cancer with one of the following clinical disease state presentations:

               1. Evidence of biochemical (PSA) or clinical relapse following local primary
                  intervention with curative intent, such as surgery, radiation therapy,
                  cryotherapy, or high-frequency ultrasound and not a candidate for salvage
                  treatment by surgery (radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or high frequency ultrasound
                  are allowed after 2 months of androgen deprivation therapy); or

               2. Newly diagnosed androgen-sensitive metastatic disease; or

               3. Advanced localized disease not suitable for local primary surgical intervention
                  with curative intent (radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or high frequency ultrasound
                  are allowed after 2 months of androgen deprivation therapy);

          3. Has a serum testosterone at the Screening visit of ≥ 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L);

          4. Has a serum PSA concentration at the Screening visit of &gt; 2.0 ng/mL (2.0 μg/L), or,
             when applicable, post radical prostatectomy of &gt; 0.2 ng/mL (0.2 μg/L) or post
             radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or high frequency ultrasound &gt; 2.0 ng/mL (2.0 μg/L) above
             the post interventional nadir;

          5. Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at
             initial screening and at baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. In the investigator's opinion, is likely to require chemotherapy or surgical therapy
             for symptomatic disease management within 2 months of initiating androgen deprivation
             therapy;

          2. Previously received GnRH analog or other form of androgen deprivation therapy
             (estrogen or antiandrogen) for &gt; 12 months total duration. If androgen deprivation
             therapy was received for ≤ 12 months total duration, then that therapy must have been
             completed at least 12 months prior to baseline;

          3. Previous treatment for prostate cancer with a taxane-based regimen;

          4. Metastases to brain per prior clinical evaluation;

          5. Features of the patient's medical condition that make life expectancy due to other

          6. Scheduled for major surgery after baseline;

          7. History of surgical castration.
