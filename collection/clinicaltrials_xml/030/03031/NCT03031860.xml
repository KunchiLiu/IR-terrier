      Patients were evaluated for readiness to be weaned off mechanical ventilation. If they had
      completed an Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) before extubation. To measure
      Semiquantitative Cough Strength Score (SCSS), the investigator will put the patients at 30°
      to 45°, measure SCSS, first. The investigator enhance the patient to cough with as much
      effort as, when the investigator disconnect the ventilator. The cough strength was scored
      from 0 to 5 as follows: 0 = no cough on command, 1 = audible movement of air through the
      endotracheal tube but no audible cough, 2 = weakly (barely) audible cough, 3 = clearly
      audible cough, 4 = stronger cough and 5 = multiple sequential strong coughs.
