      This study has the objective to clarify the factors that directly influence the
      effectiveness of inhaled drug deposition in obese patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) and the formulate specific strategies that potentiate the control
      of the evolution of this disease. The suggested strategy in order to implement the aerosol
      therapy is the use of epap valve during these patient´s inhalation therapy.

      It will consist in a cross-over clinical trial. The population will be composed by
      volunteers of both genders, aged between 45-70 years old. Four distinct groups will be
      formed: obese participants without copd; obese participants with copd; non obese
      participants without copd; non-obese participants with copd.
