    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven randomized withdrawal study to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab treatment in the Juvenile Idiopathic
      Arthritis (JIA) categories of Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis (JPsA) and Enthesitis-related
      Arthritis (ERA). The study is divided into 3 parts (plus a post-treatment follow-up period)
      consisting of open-label, single-arm active treatment in Treatment Periods 1 and 3 and a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, event-driven withdrawal design in Treatment
      Period 2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) or Juvenile psoriatic
             arthritis (JPsA) according to the International League of Associations for
             Rheumatology (ILAR) classification criteria of at least 6 months duration.

          2. Active disease (ERA or JPsA) defined as having both:

               -  at least 3 active joints

               -  at least 1 site of active enthesitis at baseline or documented by history.

          3. Inadequate response (at least 1 month) or intolerance to at least 1 nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAID)

          4. Inadequate response (at least 2 months) or intolerance to at least 1
             Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD)

          5. No concomitant use of second line agents such as disease-modifying and/or
             immunosuppressive drugs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients fulfilling any ILAR diagnostic JIA category other than ERA or JPsA.

          2. Patients who have ever received biologic immunomodulating agents

          3. Patients taking any non-biologic DMARD except for MTX (or sulfasalazine for ERA
             patients only).

          4. Patients with active uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease or active uncontrolled
             uveitis.
