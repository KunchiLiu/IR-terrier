    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the baseline safety and efficacy of NEPA
      (Netupitant/Palonosetron) for prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in
      patients receiving BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) conditioning
      regimen prior to Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Both netupitant and
      palonosetron hydrochloride are anti-nausea and anti-emetic agents. NEPA is a recently
      approved combination antiemetic, containing fixed doses of netupitant (an neurokinin 1 (NK1)
      receptor antagonist) and palonosetron (a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5HT3) receptor antagonist).
      Having pharmacologically distinct mechanisms, combined NEPA offers synergistic reduction and
      potential elimination of CINV

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of NEPA to prevent nausea and vomiting both during and after a
      highly emetogenic (BEAM) conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT). The efficacy is measured by Complete Response (CR) defined as no emesis and no
      rescue therapy for hours 0-240 (6 days of chemotherapy and 4 days post chemotherapy).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      II. To differentiate response to NEPA over different phases of chemotherapy-induced nausea.
      Specifically, CR is assessed for hours 0-144 (Acute phase) and hours 145-240 (delayed
      phase), and Complete Protection (CP) defined as CR plus no nausea is assessed for hours
      0-144, 145-240, and the whole period.

      OUTLINE: This regimen is a 6-day therapy course with high dose (and highly emetogenic)
      chemotherapy on day 1 and 6 with lower risk chemotherapy for acute emesis on days 2 through
      5. Our plan is to dose NEPA on days 1, 3, and 6 to cover the complete course of therapy and
      continue to monitor for 4 days after to assess for control of delayed CINV as well as acute.

      Treatment will be administered on an inpatient basis. Patients will receive NEPA 300 mg/0.5
      mg PO will be administered 60 minutes prior to chemotherapy on Day 1, Day 3. and Day 6.
      Dexamethasone 12 mg PO will be given 1 hour prior to chemotherapy on Day 1 and 8 mg PO will
      be given on each additional day of conditioning chemotherapy (Days 2 through 6).

      Dexamethasone will only be given on days that chemotherapy is received. BEAM HSCT
      chemotherapy conditioning regimen: Carmustine 300 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, Etoposide 200 mg/m2/day
      IV days 2 through 5, Cytarabine 400 mg.m2/day IV on days 2 through 5 and Melphalan 140 mg/m2
      IV on day 6

      MAINTENANCE: Patients will be monitored for 4 days after completion of therapy to assess for
      control of delayed CINV as well as acute. Patients will be followed 14 days after receiving
      their last dose of NEPA for potential adverse events.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be undergoing autologous or allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
             (HSCT) with the BEAM conditioning regimen prior to HSCT

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years. Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups will
             be included

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2

          -  Able to swallow oral medications

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document. be followed 14 days after receiving their last dose of NEPA for potential
             adverse events

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity or other allergic reactions attributed to
             compounds of similar biologic composition to netupitant, palonosetron, dexamethasone,
             or other agents used in the study

          -  Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents or have received another
             investigational drug in the last 30 days

          -  Subjects who have had emesis or required antiemetics in the 48 hours prior to
             starting the BEAM conditioning regimen. Also patients required to take
             antipsychotics, appetite stimulants, or other medications with antiemetic effects
             will be excluded if those medications cannot be replaced by therapeutic equivalents

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, have a positive serum Human Chorionic Gonadotropin
             (hCG), or are lactating and intend to breast feed a child. Pregnant women are
             excluded from this study because hematopoietic stem cell transplant conditioning
             regimens including the BEAM regimen have the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. NEPA itself is Pregnancy Class C. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of
             the mother with NEPA, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with NEPA. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with NEPA. In addition, these subjects
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive
             therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Subjects who have taken a neurokinin antagonist within 14 days prior to beginning the
             BEAM regimen

          -  Subjects who have a serum creatinine &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Subjects with severe renal failure or End stage renal disease (estimated GFR
             (glomerular filtration rate) of &lt; 30 mL/Min) as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault
             formula

          -  Subjects with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh score &gt;9)

          -  Subjects who have been drinking &gt; 5 alcoholic drinks daily for the last year

          -  Subjects who have concurrent illness requiring systemic corticosteroid use other than
             the planned dexamethasone during conditioning therapy.

          -  Subjects with gastrointestinal conditions which might result in malabsorption of the
             study drug

          -  Subjects with a history of anxiety-induced (&quot;anticipatory&quot;) nausea and vomiting

          -  Subjects on strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) inducers or inhibitors who are
             unable to have those agents replaced with clinical alternatives prior to beginning
             the study. Length of washout period will be 7 days. Notably, in the case of
             allogeneic transplant recipients requiring cyclosporine or tacrolimus, no empiric
             dose adjustments will be required due to close level monitoring and adjustments,
             which are standard in Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) protocols

          -  Subjects unable to discontinue benzodiazepines will not be allowed as hypnotics.
             Additional antiemetics will be allowed for rescue but not for prophylaxis

          -  Subjects with personal or family history of QT prolongation, uncorrected electrolyte
             abnormalities, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmia, conduction disturbances and
             those taking antiarrhythmic medicinal products or other medicinal products that lead
             to QT prolongation or electrolyte abnormalities. Relevant information will be
             collected during medical history taking
