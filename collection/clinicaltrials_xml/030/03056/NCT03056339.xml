  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving genetically changed immune
      cells, called NK cells, after chemotherapy will improve the disease in stem cell transplant
      patients with relapsed (has returned) and/or refractory (has not responded to treatment)
      B-cell lymphoma or leukemia. Also, researchers want to find the highest tolerable dose of
      CAR-NK cells to give to patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma or leukemia.
      The safety of this treatment will also be studied.

      Gene Transfer:

      The process of changing the DNA (the genetic material in cells) of NK cells is called &quot;gene
      transfer.&quot; NK cells will be separated out from frozen cord blood using a machine.
      Researchers then perform a gene transfer to change the NK cells' DNA, and then inject the
      genetically changed NK cells into the body of the patient receiving the transplant.

      Length of Study Participation You may be taking part in this study for up to 15 years. Your
      participation on the study will be over after the long-term follow-up visits described
      below.

      Tests Before Study Drug Administration:

      Before you receive study drugs, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for research
      tests. This blood will be used as a baseline to study the immune system before starting
      treatment.

      Within 7 days before you receive study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you can become
           pregnant, part of the blood will be used for a pregnancy test.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to help prepare your body for CAR-NK
      infusion. These drugs may kill some cancer cells, but that is not the main goal for their
      use. The day you receive the CAR-NK cells is called Day 0. The days before you receive your
      CAR-NK cells are called minus days. The days after you receive the CAR-NK cells are called
      plus days.

      On Day -6, you will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein to hydrate you.

      On Days -5, -4, and -3, you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour and
      cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours. You will also receive mesna by vein over before and
      after the cyclophosphamide dose to lower the risk of side effects to the bladder caused by
      cyclophosphamide.

      On Days -2 and -1, you will rest.

      On Day 0, you will receive the genetically modified NK cells as a cell infusion by vein.

      If you have graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or cytokine release syndrome after the NK cell
      infusion, you will receive AP1903 by vein and possibly steroids by mouth or by vein.

      GvHD occurs when donor cells attack the cells of the person receiving them. Cytokine release
      syndrome (CRS) occurs when a large amount of proteins are released into the blood. The risks
      of GvHD and CRS, some of which are serious, are described in greater detail below.

      Study Tests After the NK Infusion:

      On Day +2 and then at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 16:

      °Blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, for chimerism tests (to see
      how well the transplant has taken), and for research tests.

      During Weeks 1, 3, 4, and 16:

      °You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease and
      for research tests. To collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy, an area of the hip is numbed
      with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large
      needle.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      For safety reasons, the FDA requires that patients who receive infusions of CAR-NK cells
      treated with a gene transfer procedure must have long-term follow-up yearly for at least 15
      years after receiving the gene transfer.

      You will have blood tests performed to check to make sure you do not have a type of
      infection called the replication-competent retrovirus (RCR). For this test, blood (up to 4
      teaspoons each time) will be drawn about 1, 3, and 6 months after the NK cell infusion, then
      again every 6 months for 5 years, and then once a year after that for 10 years.

      If the RCR test results during the first year after the NK cell infusion show that you do
      not have the RCR infection, the rest of your leftover blood samples (left over from RCR
      testing in Years 2-15) will be stored at Bellicum Pharmaceuticals for safety reasons. This
      is so researchers can study any changes in your blood (related to RCR) that may arise in
      Years 2-15.

      This is an investigational study. The making of and infusion of genetically changed NK cells
      and the drug AP1903 (if you receive it, explained below) are not FDA approved or
      commercially available for use in this type of disease. They are currently being used for
      research purposes only. The chemotherapy drugs in this study (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide,
      and mesna) are commercially available and FDA approved.

      Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
