        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥18 years of age

          2. Treated with eculizumab for PNH for at least 6 months prior to Day 1

          3. LDH level ≤ 1.5 × ULN at screening

          4. PNH diagnosis confirmed by documented by high-sensitivity flow cytometry

          5. Documented meningococcal vaccination not more than 3 years prior to, or at the time
             of, initiating study treatment.

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception
             starting at screening and continuing until at least 8 months after the last dose of
             ALXN1210

          7. Willing and able to give written informed consent and comply with study visit
             schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of bone marrow transplantation

          2. Body weight &lt; 40 kilograms

          3. History of or ongoing major cardiac, pulmonary, renal, endocrine, or hepatic disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, would preclude participation.

          4. Unstable medical conditions (eg, myocardial ischemia, active gastrointestinal bleed,
             severe congestive heart failure, anticipated need for major surgery within 6 months
             of randomization, coexisting chronic anemia unrelated to PNH)

          5. Females who are pregnant, breastfeeding or who have a positive pregnancy test at
             screening or Day 1

          6. Participation in another interventional clinical study or use of any experimental
             therapy within 30 days before initiation of study drug on Day 1 in this study or
             within 5 half-lives of that investigational product, whichever is greater.
