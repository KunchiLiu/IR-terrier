      Post-Approval Study of the R3 Biolox Delta Ceramic Acetabular System - US The R3 Ceramic
      Acetabular System is indicated for use in skeletally mature patients requiring primary total
      hip arthroplasty due to non-inflammatory arthritis (degenerative joint disease) such as
      osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, or traumatic arthritis. The expected timeline for the
      study is a total of approximately 5 years: 6 months for site initiation, 12 months for
      subject enrollment, 3 years until the last subject enrolled has reached the 3 year follow-up
      interval.

        To eliminate the potential for selection bias, Investigators should consecutively
        pre-screen all subjects undergoing planned total hip replacement with the R3 delta Ceramic
        Acetabular System.
