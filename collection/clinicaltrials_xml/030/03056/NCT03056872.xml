  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence is among the most common and costly public health problems affecting the
      nation. Among individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD), those with (vs. without) a
      co-occurring anxiety disorder (AnxD) are as much as twice as likely to relapse in the months
      following AUD treatment. Dysregulation of biological stress-mood systems predict and
      correlate with AUD relapse and AnxD symptomatology. In contrast, stress system re-regulation
      correlates with improved AUD treatment outcomes but has not been examined with respect to
      AUD recovery and relapse in co-occurring AUD+AnxD.

      The objectives of the proposed research are to 1) evaluate the effect of co-occurring AnxD
      on the severity of biological stress-mood system dysregulations in AUD inpatients at
      pre-treatment, 2) evaluate the effect of co-occurring AnxD on the persistence of stress-mood
      system dysregulations in AUD inpatients in the months following treatment, 3) evaluate the
      effects of treatment on biological stress-mood system re-regulation among AUD patients with
      co-occurring AnxD, and 4) evaluate the effect of re-regulation change in biological
      stress-mood system function on AUD clinical outcomes.
