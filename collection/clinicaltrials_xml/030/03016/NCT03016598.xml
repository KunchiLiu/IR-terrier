      This study will investigate the effects of intranasal administration of oxytocin, a social
      neuropeptide, on reduction in stimulant use, enhancing group cohesion and therapeutic
      engagement, and susceptibility to stress-induced relapse in Veterans with stimulant use
      disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High rates of substance use disorders (SUDs) in Veterans compared to the general population
      are heavily influenced by psychosocial factors - such as difficulty reintegrating into
      civilian life due to avoidance of vital support systems - leading to disproportionately
      elevated unmet addiction treatment needs. Administering oxytocin, a mammalian neuropeptide,
      intranasally to healthy controls facilitates the stress-buffering properties of social
      support. Oxytocin may also have an independent role in mitigating the symptoms of SUDs. For
      example, in animal models of addiction, oxytocin administration directly reduces tolerance,
      withdrawal effects, self-administration, and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking
      for a range of addictive substances. Moreover, oxytocin plays a role in modulating the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is involved in stress-induced SUD relapse.
      While results of early translational work in oxytocin and SUDs in humans, including my own
      pilot work, have been promising, findings have varied based on social context. A more
      integrated understanding of oxytocin's distinct effects on the behavior and psychology of 1)
      addiction, 2) sociality, and 3) stress reactivity could be the key to defining oxytocin's
      role in SUD treatment. This is particularly relevant to Veterans with SUDs, who are at a
      disadvantage due to increased rates of comorbid avoidant attachment - a measurable
      personality variant defined by avoidance of social intimacy and overvalued independence -
      and posttraumatic stress symptoms preventing retention in existing SUD treatment paradigms
      and heightening vulnerability to stress-induced substance use. This study will uniquely
      combine psychopharmacological and evidence-based psychosocial interventions targeted at
      improving sociality, treatment engagement, and stress responsivity to enhance overall
      recovery among Veterans with SUDs.
