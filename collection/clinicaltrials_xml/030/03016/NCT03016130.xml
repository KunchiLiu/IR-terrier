  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-arm, phase III non-inferiority trial to evaluate the safety of a
      liberalized hospital diet inclusive of fresh fruits and vegetables to a neutropenic diet in
      patients with prolonged neutropenia. Both cohorts and diets will adhere to the hygiene and
      common sense advice listed in the FDA-endorsed food safety guidelines.

        leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) receiving
        induction chemotherapy, or any patient undergoing allogeneic or autologous HSCT for any
        indication. Previously enrolled patients with underlying AML, MDS or ALL undergoing HSCT
        may be re-entered and randomized again if there is a washout period of at least 2 weeks or
        more from neutrophil recovery and they otherwise meet the inclusion criteria.

             diet)

          -  Uncontrolled HIV, Hepatitis B and C infection

          -  Use of neutropenic diet within 72 hours prior to consent
