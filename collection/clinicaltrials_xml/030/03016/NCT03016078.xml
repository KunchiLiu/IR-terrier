  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall rationale for this investigation is to evaluate the clinical performance
      potential for Mepilex Border Post-Op Ag in the ability to minimize the risk of skin related
      post-operative wound complications such as blistering, maceration and redness at the
      incision and surrounding skin.

          3. Plan for elective primary hip or knee arthroplasty

          4. Plan for incision size ≤18 cm

          5. Provision of informed consent i.e. subject must be able to understand and sign the
             Patient Information and Consent Form

          6. Undergoing elective primary arthroplasty of the hip or knee.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Known allergy/hypersensitivity to any of the components of the dressing

          2. Multi-trauma

          6. Neurological deficit of operated side (hemiplegia, etc.)

          7. Documented skin disease at time of enrollment, as judged by the investigator

          8. Previously enrolled in the present investigation

          9. Inclusion in other ongoing investigations at present that would preclude the subject
             from participating in this investigation as judged by the investigator

         10. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the clinical investigation (applies to all
