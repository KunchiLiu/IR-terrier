    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a multi-center prospective observational study of newly diagnosed
      Heart Failure (HF) patients to test the hypothesis that additional Ejection Fraction (EF)
      recovery occurs between 90 and 180 days as Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) is
      achieved. Although the study doesn't start until day 90, all eligible, consenting patients
      will be entered into a registry at the start of wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD)
      use. The pre-study registry will allow us to collect early (90 day) outcomes and data in
      those patients who are likely to be eligible for the study at day 90, or are eligible, but
      refuse the study at day 90.

      This study will be conducted at thirty to sixty sites, initially in US and Europe. It will
      be used to observe the rate of recovery of ventricular function (EF&gt;35%) between 90 and 180
      days in newly diagnosed HF patients who were prescribed the WCD ≤ 10 days post-discharge
      after hospitalization for a primary reason of new onset HF (≤30 days since first HF
      hospitalization), with ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and have already used a WCD
      for 90 ± 14 days. For the first 90 days of WCD use, patients will be enrolled in a pre-study
      registry. The FDA-approved WCD will be prescribed for up to 6 months of use after hospital
      discharge, with the option for longer use under physician discretion. Approximately 870
      subjects will enroll into the pre-study registry and 750 subjects into the study.

    <description>Patient improved EF from start of WCD use (a positive change of at least 5 percentage points in EF), or has a borderline EF of 30-35%, but still has continued SCD risk (EF ≤ 35%). These patients are expected to continue to use the WCD for an additional 3 months.</description>

    <description>Patient not improved from start of WCD use (no change or worsening of EF), EF&lt;30% and has continued high SCD risk. These patients will either continue the WCD for an additional 90 days if not on GDMT, or receive an ICD if already on GDMT.</description>

    <description>Evaluate the effect of wearable defibrillators on 90,180, 270, and 360-day mortality following discharge in HF patients. Assessment of survival will be made at these time points for those entered into the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Part 1

          -  Patients (≥18 years old) who were prescribed the WCD ≤ 10 days post-discharge after
             hospitalization for a primary reason of new onset HF (≤30 days since first HF
             hospitalization), with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and have used the WCD
             for no more than 30 days.

          -  Patients who had an EF ≤ 35% during index hospitalization (must be last measurement
             if performed multiple times).

          -  Patients with any skin condition that would prevent wearing the device.

          -  Patients with an advanced directive prohibiting resuscitation.
