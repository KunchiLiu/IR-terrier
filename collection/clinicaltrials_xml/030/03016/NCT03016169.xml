    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Trifecta™ GT
      (Glide Technology) valve through 5 year follow-up in a prospective, multi-center, real-world
      setting. This study is intended to satisfy post-market clinical follow-up requirements of CE
      Mark in Europe.

    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective multi-center evaluation of approximately 350 subjects implanted
      with a St. Jude Medical (SJM) Trifecta™ GT valve. It will be conducted in approximately 35
      sites worldwide.

      Subjects will be followed for 5 years. The total duration of the study is expected to be 6
      years, assuming all subjects are enrolled within 1 year of study initiation. To ensure
      enrollment balance across sites, no individual site can enroll more than 10% of the sample
      size (n=35 subjects) without prior approval from the sponsor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject undergoes a concomitant procedure of mitral or tricuspid valve replacement at

             antibiotic therapy prior to the valve implantation surgery).

          5. Subject has had a stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to the
             planned valve implantation surgery.

          6. Subject is undergoing renal dialysis.
