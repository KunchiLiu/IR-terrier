    <textblock>
      Patients who are prescribed physical therapy exercises for their shoulder will have
      increased compliance to their PT exercises, an increased PROMIS- Upper Extremity CAT score,
      and will have increased range of motion (or reach maximum range of motion earlier) at the
      end of the 3 month EpxPhysicalTherapy intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient compliance to their prescribed physical therapy (PT) exercises is reported to be
      22-40% in various studies. Further, Vasey et al. found that about 8% of patients do not even
      schedule a follow up PT appointment after it is prescribed. Low adherence presents a problem
      since long term completion of prescribed home exercises has been correlated with improved
      health outcomes. Sluijs et al. found that low adherence to PT exercises can be primarily
      attributed to three factors: (1) the barriers patients perceive and encounter, (2) the lack
      of positive feedback, and (3) the degree of helplessness. An automated phone/texting system
      can help with these three points by increasing positive feedback, increasing compliance, and
      monitoring patient progress. The system can continually remind the patient that their end
      goal is possible, which will decrease their feeling of helplessness in their condition.

      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores have created a
      unique measurement that allows for cross study comparison between multiple medical
      disciplines. PROMIS attempts to measure the physical, mental, and social health of
      individuals with chronic conditions. PROMIS has been validated as a cross study/discipline
      tool by multiple studies. PROMIS- Upper Extremity is a subcategory of PROMIS Physical
      Function and focuses on activities that require the use of the upper extremities including
      shoulder, arm, and hand activities. Examples include writing, using buttons, or opening
      containers. Using PROMIS- Upper Extremities as a measure of upper extremity physical
      function has been validated by DÃ¶ring et al. and Hays et al. While PROMIS- Upper Extremity
      has not been used to monitor shoulder function after PT intervention in literature, PROMIS
      scores have been used to monitor ankle, foot, and knee function after rehabilitation.

      Telemedicine shows promise in improving the outcomes of orthopedic interventions. Medication
      adherence and patient outcomes have been shown to improve in interventions that include
      reminders. Also, because the adoption of cell phones is nearly ubiquitous worldwide and the
      vast majority of cell phone users text message, a text-message-based intervention seems
      particularly promising.

      Many studies have shown that SMS text messaging has increased treatment compliance. PT
      adherence to prescribed exercises seems to be limited by compliance, so Epharmix along with
      several orthopedic surgeons set out to develop an intervention. The result,
      EpxPhysicalTherapy (EpxPT), is an automated system that ensures that patients have both
      scheduled their physical therapy appointment and have performed their home exercises. It
      also sends motivational text messages to the patient to encourage the participant to perform
      their exercises since a lack of positive reinforcement has been correlated with decreased
      compliance. When a patient identifies that they have been unable to schedule a PT
      appointment or have not completed their exercises for multiple days in a row, an alert is
      sent to the healthcare team.

      The system was designed to deliver either voice or text-based automated messages to patients
      in a way that avoids an additional burden on the healthcare team. EpxPT offers numerous
      advantages to strictly app-based or text message-based systems in both older and
      underprivileged patient populations. Older patients, who may be more comfortable with voice
      messages, have that option, and patients without a smartphone will still be able to receive
      the intervention.

      Patients identified to be eligible for this study and have consented will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will receive the standard of care alone (control) and
      Group 2 will receive the EpxPT intervention. In Group 2, EpxPT will remind the patient to
      schedule their first PT appointment. Group 2 patients will also be asked if they have
      completed their prescribed PT exercises every other day. They will then be sent a
      motivational text messages or voice call in order to highlight the importance of completing
      their PT regimen. Group 2 patient compliance will be tracked through the text responses
      recorded in the Epharmix database. Both Group 1 and Group 2 patients will be seen at a
      follow up appointment once a month for three months. At this appointment, patients in both
      groups will be asked about their PT compliance (this will be the measurement of compliance
      for Group 1), and range of motion and a PROMIS- Upper Extremity CAT score will be measured.

        -  Aim 1: To compare control and intervention group compliance to their prescribed
           physical therapy home exercise regimen

        -  Aim 2: To compare control and intervention group shoulder range of motion after a 3
           month intervention

        -  Aim 3: To compare control and intervention group PROMIS- Upper Extremity CAT scores
           after a 3 month intervention
