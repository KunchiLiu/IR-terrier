  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, equivalence, multicentre Phase III
      study. 560 patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) will be randomised (1:1) to
      receive either HD201 in combination with docetaxel (n=280) or Herceptin® in combination with
      docetaxel (n=280).

      HD201 or Herceptin® with concomitant docetaxel will be administered every 3 weeks until the
      end of the 8th cycle, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or
      withdrawal of consent by the patient, or the investigator decides to discontinue treatment,
      whichever comes first. Patients without disease progression after the 8th cycle can continue
      to receive HD201 or Herceptin® with or without docetaxel for a total of 12 months after the
      first treatment administration. Continued treatment with docetaxel will be at the discretion
      of the treating physician. Patients completing the first 12 months of treatment and those
      discontinuing the study will attend an End of Study visit 4 weeks after last administration
      of study medication. After the last administration of study medication patients will be
      treated according to their physician's discretion. These patients will be followed every 3
      months for an additional 12 months or until death, whichever occurs first, to collect data
      on cardiac safety and disease status. All procedures will be performed at the investigators
      discretion. All patients who withdraw from the study before the end of the first 12 months
      of treatment will be followed up for at least 12 months or until death, whichever occurs
      first. Patients will attend study visits every 3 weeks (+/- 3 days). At each visit, patients
      will undergo a complete physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG),
      weight, performance status, clinical laboratory tests, adverse events (AEs), concomitant
      medication and patient compliance.

      Tumor response will be evaluated at screening and every 3 treatment cycles, using the
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST). The same imaging techniques will be
      used throughout the entire duration of the study. Cardiac safety will be assessed at
      screening and every 3 treatment cycles throughout the study using echocardiography or multi
      gated acquisition (MUGA) scan to evaluate the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The
      primary efficacy endpoint, ORR, will be defined as the proportion of patients whose best
      overall response is either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to
      RECIST. The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of study
      treatment to the end of the 8th cycle.

      Sparse sampling will be performed in a subset of patients (75 per treatment group) to
      facilitate a population-based pharmacokinetic (PK) approach using nonlinear mixed-effects
      modelling. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will act in an advisory capacity to
      monitor patient safety and efficacy and PK data from the trial. The members will be selected
      on the basis of relevant experience and understanding of clinical research and the issues
      specific to the therapeutic area, as well as previous data monitoring committee experience.
