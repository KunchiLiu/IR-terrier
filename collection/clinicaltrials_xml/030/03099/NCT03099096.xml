  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to assess the correct real-world use of an autoinjector for the repeat
      self-administration of mepolizumab SC, so to improve subject / physician convenience and to
      enable repeat dose self injection themselves or via caregivers. This Phase III study will be
      an open-label, single-arm, repeat-dose, multi-centre study of mepolizumab liquid drug
      product in autoinjector (100 milligrams [mg]) administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks
      (3 doses) in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. Subjects will receive 100 mg
      mepolizumab SC as a single injection that is self-administered in the thigh, abdomen or
      administered in the upper arm (caregiver only). Each subject will participate in the study
      for up to 18 weeks including pre-screening visit, a screening visit and a 12-week treatment
      period which concludes with end of study assessments (Visit 5) 4 weeks after the last dose
      of mepolizumab. Approximately 158 subjects will be enrolled in the study.

             dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 with or without
             maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS), for subjects &gt;=18 years old, ICS dose must be
             &gt;=880 micrograms (mcg)/day fluticasone propionate (FP) (ex-actuator) or equivalent

             receiving continuous ICS and the Investigator attest that the subject should have
             been treated with high dose ICS to mitigate the risk of exacerbations, or the subject
             has financial or tolerance issues that prevent the use of high-dose ICS. Such
             subjects should be discussed with GSK Medical Monitor prior to enrolment)

          -  Exacerbation history: Previously confirmed history of one or more exacerbations
             requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroid (CS) [intramuscular (IM),

             ICS. For subjects receiving maintenance CS, the CS treatment for an exacerbation must
             have been a two-fold dose increase or greater.
