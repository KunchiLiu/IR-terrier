  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized withdrawal study in which responders to open-label treatment with tofacitinib
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to tofacitinib or placebo in a double-blind phase. In the
      double-blind phase &quot;time to sJIA flare&quot; will be evaluated as primary endpoint and subjects
      will be discontinued once they experience sJIA flare. Once 31 flares are reported the study
      will be completed.

          -  active sJIA disease according to ILAR criteria for at least 6 weeks before screening

          -  Treatment with stable doses of methotrexate (MTX) ≤25 mg/week or ≤20 mg/m2/week,
             whichever is lower, is permitted;

          -  Treatment with a stable dose of oral prednisone ≤1 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 30
             mg/day, or equivalent, for at least 1 week before the first study drug dose is
             permitted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous JIA treatment with tofacitinib;

          -  Current symptoms or findings of myocarditis, endocarditis or more than minimal
             pericardial effusion associated with sJIA. Current symptoms or findings of more than
             minimal pleuritis with sJIA

          -  Subjects who have previously failed treatment with more than two biologic DMARDs.
             Note: all subjects will be allowed to have previously failed one biologic DMARD, and
             up to forty (40) percent of subjects will be allowed to have previously failed two
             biologic DMARDs provided that washout periods are respected.
