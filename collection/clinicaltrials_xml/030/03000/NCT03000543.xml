      Background:

        1. Burden: Recently Bangladesh has introduced mandatory vitamin A (VA) fortification of
           refined edible oil while high dose VA supplementations for infants and children are
           still in place as part of national program. Thus preschool children are plausible at
           risk of hypervitaminosis A.

        2. Knowledge gap: Serum VA concentration is not an authenticate indicator of VA status,
           while existing deuterium- VA isotope dilution methods to determine whole body VA status
           require 3 weeks and not applicable for infants and children.

        3. Relevance: Our research group has recently developed a new simplified equation to
           measure VA pool size in 4-5 days, highly correlated with compartmental model-predicted
           value and estimate VA pool size in adults with high precision. However, it is not clear
           whether this new simplified equation also works in infants and children. In this
           proposed study, we validate the method in healthy infants and infants with inflammatory
           condition as well as in children with adequate and high dietary VA intake.

      Hypothesis: (1) Whole-body VA status in infant and children can be estimated without
      accounting for fractional catabolic rate in the context of inflammatory condition or higher
      dietary VA intake (2) Fortification of commonly consumed food item with VA along with
      periodic high dose VA supplementation would increase the risk of hypervitaminosis A among
      preschool children in Bangladesh

      Methods: Our study comprises two studies. &quot;Study 01&quot; will be undertaken in infants while
      &quot;Study 02&quot; for preschool children. At first we need to undertake one feasibility study to
      verify whether the oral dose of 400 μg 13C10 or 13C3- retinyl acetate (isotopic VA) that we
      propose to use in this study would work in infants as we observed in adults, secondly,
      whether PENTA valent vaccines induce inflammation in infants (plasma CRP as maker) that
      closely mimics natural infection. We need such infants with inflammatory condition in &quot;Study
      01&quot; to answer the question of whether the isotope dilution technique will still work in
      children who undergo inflammation. Information of the reliability of the retinol isotope
      dilution technique in infectious conditions is important as national dietary assessment
      surveys often observe children with chronic or latent infection. To minimize the taking of
      multiple blood samples from each infant/child in both studies, a &quot;super kid study&quot; design
      will be adopted that ensure no more than 2 venous blood samples from each infant/child, even
      though multiple time points (at least 5 subjects / time-point) over a 28-day study period
      will be available for mathematical modelling. In &quot;Study 01&quot; a total of 115 infants (9-11 mo)
      will receive an oral dose of 13C10- retinyl acetate (400 μg) dissolved in 0.5 mL of
      sunflower oil and then blood samples will be taken from 6h to 16th day at 9 different
      time-points. On day 16, a single dose PENTA vaccine will be provided to the randomly
      selected 50% of infants. On day 17, another type of stable isotopic VA e.g. 13C3- retinyl
      acetate (400 μg) will be orally supplemented to all infants. Blood sample will be collected
      from day 16 to day 28 at 11 different time-points for each of the vaccine and non-vaccine
      groups. In &quot;Study 02&quot; 50 children (3-5y) in each of the &quot;adequate dietary VA&quot; intake group
      and &quot;higher dietary VA&quot; intake group will be enrolled to receive an oral dose of 13C10-
      retinyl acetate (400 μg). Blood sample will be collected from 6h to day 28 at 11 time-points
      for each of the two groups. Specific activity of 13C10-VA and 13C3-VA from the blood samples
      will be measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Plasma
      biomarkers of VA toxicity e.g. bone metabolism, liver fibrogenesis and VA metabolites will
      be measured in the children of &quot;Study 02&quot;.

      Outcome measures/variables: (1) The early time point equation for assessing VA pool size in
      a group of infants with or without inflammation and in a group of children with adequate or
      with high dietary VA intake. (2) The association between biomarkers of VA toxicity and
      estimated liver vitamin A concentration in preschool children at risk of hypervitaminosis A.
