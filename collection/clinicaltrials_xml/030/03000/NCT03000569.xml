      Part A of the study is an open-label design with dosing of Levodopa for 3 days followed by
      SAGE-217 for 4 days.

      Part B of the study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-sequence crossover design.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to open-label Levodopa plus blinded SAGE-217 or placebo
      for Period 1 (4 days). In Period 2 (4 days) all subjects will receive open-label SAGE-217
      for 4 days.
