    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study to determine the recommended Phase 2
      dose (RPTD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile of ABBV-181. The study will consist of 2 parts: ABBV-181 dose escalation and
      ABBV-181 dose expansion.

    <description>If a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, the RPTD of ABBV-181 will not be a dose higher than the defined MTD, and will be selected based on the type(s) and occurrence(s) of dose limiting toxicities which occur in addition to the MTD. If a MTD is not reached, then the RPTD will be defined based on the safety and other available data.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have an advanced solid tumor and must not be a candidate for
             surgical resection or other approved therapeutic regimen known to provide clinical
             benefit. For dose escalation, the participant may have been previously treated with a
             programmed cell death 1 (PD-I) targeting agent. For dose expansion, the participant
             must be PD-I/PD-L1 targeting agent na√Øve.

          -  Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0
             to 2.

          -  Participants have adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic and coagulation function.

          -  Participants must have measurable or evaluable disease per Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in the dose escalation portion of the
             trial. Participants in the expansion cohort must have measurable disease per RECIST
             version 1.1 or disease evaluable by assessment of tumor antigens.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has received anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             radiation therapy, biologic, herbal therapy, or any investigational therapy within a
             period of 21 days, prior to the first dose of ABBV-181.

          -  Participant has unresolved adverse events greater than or equal to grade 1 from prior
             anticancer therapy except for alopecia.

          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days prior to the
             first dose (with certain exceptions).

          -  History of primary immunodeficiency, bone marrow transplantation, chronic lymphocytic
             leukemia, solid organ transplantation, or previous clinical diagnosis of
             tuberculosis.

          -  Confirmed positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or
             participants with chronic or active hepatitis B or C.

          -  Participant has known history or inflammatory bowel disease, pneumonitis, or known
             uncontrolled metastases to the central nervous system (CNS) (with certain
             exceptions).
