  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 2-treatment period, randomized, multicenter parallel-group study. The
      overall purpose of this study is to provide long- term safety data for fevipiprant (QAW039)
      (Dose 1 and Dose 2), compared with placebo, when added to the Global Initiative for Asthma
      (GINA) steps 3, 4, and 5 standard-of-care (SoC) asthma therapy (GINA 2016), in patients with
      moderate-to- severe asthma.
