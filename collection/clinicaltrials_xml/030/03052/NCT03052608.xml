  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase 3 study to demonstrate whether lorlatinib given as monotherapy is superior to
      crizotinib alone in prolonging the progression-free survival in advanced ALK-positive NSCLC
      patients who are treatment naïve and to compare lorlatinib to crizotinib with respect to
      overall survival in the same population
