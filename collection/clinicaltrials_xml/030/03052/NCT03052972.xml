      This study is designed to assess the imaging characteristics of Flortaucipir (18F-AV-1451)
      in subjects who participated in the Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline Among Normal Individuals
      (BIOCARD) study at Johns Hopkins University.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females that have provided consent and are currently enrolled in BIOCARD
             study

          -  Ability to tolerate PET scan procedures

          -  Ability to provide informed consent for study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has condition(s) that could augment risk to participant or compromise ability to
             tolerate experimental procedures or interfere with analysis of the study data as
             determined by the investigator

          -  Has a history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes or taking medications known to
             cause QT prolongation.

          -  Has ECG acquired prior to initial 18F-AV-1451 scan that clinically contradicts
             subject's participation in the study as determined by the investigator. Bazett's
             corrected QT (QTcB) interval must be assessed and not exceed accepted values (458
             msec in males, 474 msec in females).

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are not surgically sterile, not refraining from
             sexual activity, or not using reliable contraceptive methods.

          -  Has hypersensitivity to 18F-AV-1451.

          -  Has a currently clinically significant infectious disease, endocrine/metabolic
             disease, pulmonary/renal/hepatic impairment, or cancer that could impact study
             participation or scan results in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Has a non-study related radiopharmaceutical imaging/treatment procedure within seven
             days prior to 18F-AV-1451 imaging visit.

          -  Is unsuitable for a study of this type in the opinion of the investigator.
