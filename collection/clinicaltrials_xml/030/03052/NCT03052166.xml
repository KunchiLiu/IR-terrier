      Brief Summary: The QT Ultrasound system is an automated scanner which transmits pulsed
      ultrasound plane waves through the breast, as well as collects reflected ultrasound output.
      As the patient lays prone on a table, the breast is submerged in a warm water bath. The
      transmitter and receiver assembly moves around the suspended breast to record data for
      successive sub-volumes of targeted tissue. More than 2000 elements in the curvilinear
      transducer's array encircle the breast to gather data from the tissue structures of the
      breast, from nipple to chest wall. Information gathered from this automated QT scan
      encompasses the entire breast which is currently not commercially available using any other
      ultrasound technology.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, multi-arm case collection study, with IRB approval. The
      study will follow an adaptive design with an initially planned total enrollment of
      approximately 350 cases to include both benign and malignant cases, representative of all
      tissue densities.

      The images and clinical data accrued in this prospective case collection will be used for
      creation of a database to facilitate future reader's studies, publications, building
      teaching files, and future marketing for QT Ultrasound.

          -  Willing to receive a QT Ultrasound Breast Scan

          -  Eligible for routine screening mammography as per ACR guidelines or have been
             recommended to undergo breast biopsy based on standard of care assessment within 3
             months of QT Ultrasound Breast Scan

          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed Informed Consent Form (ICF) after the
             nature of the study has been explained, all questions have been answered, and prior
             to any research-related procedure(s)

          -  Willing and able to submit or complete at the clinical site a Digital Mammography
             with Digital Breast Tomosynthesis exam (to include Craniocaudal (CC) and Mediolateral
             Oblique (MLO) views - for one or both breasts, within 3 months, before or after,
             their QT scan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Currently breastfeeding

          -  Allergies to device materials

          -  History of breast cancer in the past 12 months

          -  Most recent screening mammography exam was completed more than 3 months but less than
             11 months prior.

          -  History of breast surgeries or interventional breast procedures in the past 12
             months, except for Fine Needle Aspiration(s) or Cyst Aspiration(s)

             prone and still for up to 30 minutes at a time

          -  Open wounds, sores or skin rash present on the breast(s) or nipple discharge from the
             scanned breast

          -  Breasts too large for scanner, i.e. inability to successfully &quot;fit&quot; breast after the
             subject is placed on scanner

          -  Has a concurrent disease or condition which in the judgment of the Principal
             Investigator disqualifies the subject, from participating in the study
