      A prospective, open label, multi-center, single arm, observational study designed to
      evaluate the acute safety and device procedural success of the Sapphire II PRO 1.0 and 1.25
      mm PTCA dilatation catheters in subjects with stenotic coronary arteries or bypass grafts
      during percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Sixty (60) subjects will be treated at up to 5 U.S. sites with the Sapphire II PRO diameters
      1.0 and 1.25 mm PTCA dilatation catheters to pre-dilate coronary arteries or bypass grafts
      during their index procedure. All subjects will be screened according to the protocol
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be followed through hospital discharge.

      <textblock>
        Clinical Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Subject or a legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent
             prior to any study related procedures.

          3. Subject must agree not to participate in any other clinical study during
             hospitalization for the index procedure that would interfere with the endpoints of
             this study.

          4. Subjects must have a single or double vessel coronary artery disease and clinical
             evidence of ischemic heart disease, such as stable / unstable angina or silent
             ischemia.

             Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          5. Subject must have de novo or restenotic lesion(s) in native coronary arteries or
             bypass grafts that are suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention. An embolic
             protection device must be used in all Saphenous venous grafts (SVG) interventions
             performed during the index procedure.

          6. A maximum of two lesions, including at least one target lesion, in up to two coronary
             arteries.

          7. Target and non-target lesions must be located in different coronary arteries or
             bypass grafts.

          8. Target lesion(s) must have a diameter stenosis of ≥70% by visual estimation and may
             include chronic total occlusions (CTO)

          9. Treatment of non-target lesion, if any, must be completed prior to treatment of
             target lesion and must be deemed a clinical angiographic success.

          8. Subject has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;30% (LVEF may be
             obtained at the time of the index procedure if the value is unknown, if necessary)

             Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

          9. More than two lesions requiring treatment.

         10. Unprotected left main coronary artery disease.(Greater than 50% diameter stenosis)

         11. Coronary artery spasm of the target vessel in the absence of a significant stenosis.

         12. Target lesion with angiographic presence of probable or definite thrombus.

         13. Target lesion involves a bifurcation requiring treatment with more than one stent or
             pre-dilatation of a side branch &gt;2.0 mm in diameter.

         14. Non-target lesion to be treated during the index procedure meets any of the following
             criteria:

               -  Located within a bypass graft (venous or arterial)

               -  Left main location

               -  Chronic total occlusion

               -  Involves a bifurcation (e.g., bifurcations requiring treatment with more than 1
                  stent)

               -  Treatment not deemed a clinical angiographic success
