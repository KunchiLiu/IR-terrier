  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus Aureus is a common pathogen colonising the skin of Atopic Dermatitis patients
      and is responsible for the frequent relapses and complications associated with the disease.
      Synalar cream; Supiroban 2% and Cetamacrogol, are frequently used separately in the
      treatment of AD. However the use of Supiroban 2%, in a mixture of Synalar cream and
      Cetamacrogol cream as a combined formulation, has not been studied in children suffering
      from severe AD. The aim of this trial is to determine the efficacy of combination therapy
      which includes a topical antibiotic, a topical steroid cream and a moisturizing cream over a
      3 to 4 month period in children.

      Trial Design: A two-center, single blinded, randomized parallel group, superiority trial.

      Type of control: Active controls without placebo

      Study population and Setting:

      A sample of 44 subjects will be recruited from Red Cross Children's Hospital and Umtata
      Hospital.

      Estimated duration of trial: 6 months.

      Duration of participation: Each subject will participate in the trial for a maximum of 90
      days.

      Primary endpoint: reduction in SCORAD scores; frequency of clinical flares for AD and
      improvement in the quality of life at 90 days.

      Benefit/Significance

      A simple and effective approach to the management of atopic eczema.

    <description>Subjects will be given standard of care treatment which includes bathing with a soap substitute (emulsifying ointment) once a day and applying Cetamacrogol and fluocinolone acetonide daily to the affected areas followed by moisturizing the whole body with a blend moisturizer three times a day.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be prescribed an appropriately tailored, patient specific compounded cream comprising of Cetamacrogol, Supiroban 2% cream and fluocinolone acetonide. The compounded cream will be applied to obvious areas of eczema. The prescriber will advise a high frequency of applications for the early stages of treatment (e.g. 3 applications per day for 7 days). Patients will start to taper in the 2nd week of treatment, at an appropriate pace and will be under the supervision of a dermatologist. Maintenance comprises a long period of low frequency of applications (e.g. one application every three days).</description>
