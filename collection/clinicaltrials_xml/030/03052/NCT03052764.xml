    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U (BOTOX®),
      compared to placebo, when injected into the bladder using an alternative injection paradigm
      in reducing the number of daily urinary incontinence episodes in patients with overactive
      bladder (OAB) and urinary incontinence whose symptoms have not been adequately managed with
      an anticholinergic.
