        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer not
             amenable to curative therapy.

          -  Patients who have a diagnosis for which a PD(L)-1 inhibitor is FDA approved must have
             previously received treatment with one of these therapies.

          -  Patients must have a disease that is measurable by RECIST v1.1 and at least 2 tumors
             that are accessible to biopsy.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Patients must have ECOG Performance Status ≤2.

          -  Patients must meet the following laboratory criteria:

               1. ANC ≥1.5 x 109/L (≥1500/mm3)

               2. Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L (≥100,000/mm3)

               3. Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL (≥4.96 mmol/L)

               4. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or 24-hour creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/minute

               5. AST ≤2.5 x ULN; ALT ≤2.5 x ULN or AST/ALT &lt;5 x ULN if liver involvement

               6. Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN, except in patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who must
                  have a total bilirubin &lt;3 mg/dL (51.3 μmol/L)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received prior therapy with a TLR agonist (prior treatment with a
             topical TLR agonist (e.g. imiquimod) is permitted).

          -  Patients who have received treatment with IFN-α within the previous 6 months prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any oligodeoxynucleotide that cannot be
             adequately managed with appropriate prophylaxis.

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring disease-modifying therapy.

          -  Patients requiring concurrent systemic steroid therapy higher than physiologic dosage
             (7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent).

          -  Patients with another primary malignancy that has not been in remission for at least
             3 years. The following are exempt from the 3-year limit: non-melanoma skin cancer,
             curatively treated localized prostate cancer with non-detectable prostate-specific
             antigen, cervical carcinoma in situ on biopsy or a squamous intraepithelial lesion on
             Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, and thyroid cancer (except anaplastic).

          -  Patients with active infections requiring systemic treatment.

          -  Patients who are known to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive.

          -  Patients with a known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patients with known central nervous system, meningeal, or epidural disease. Patients
             with stable brain metastases following definitive local treatment are eligible if
             steroid requirement is &lt;7.5 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent).

          -  Patients with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease.
