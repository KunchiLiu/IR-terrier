        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects diagnosed with atopic dermatitis as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka
             criteria.

          -  Subjects with a history of atopic dermatitis for at least 2 years.

          -  Subjects with an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 2 to 3 at screening and
             baseline.

          -  Subjects with body surface area of atopic dermatitis involvement, excluding the face
             and intertriginous areas, of 3% to 20% at screening and baseline.

          -  Subjects who agree to discontinue all agents used to treat atopic dermatitis from
             screening through the final follow-up visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with evidence of active acute or chronic infections.

          -  Use of topical treatments for atopic dermatitis (other than bland emollients) within
             2 weeks of baseline.

          -  Systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs (eg, oral or injectable
             corticosteroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine)
             within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives of baseline (whichever is longer).

          -  Subjects with other dermatologic disease besides atopic dermatitis whose presence or
             treatments could complicate the assessment of disease (eg, psoriasis).

          -  Subjects with a history of other diseases besides dermatologic disorders (eg, other
             autoimmune diseases) taking treatments that could complicate assessments.

          -  Subjects with cytopenias at screening, defined as:

               -  Leukocytes &lt; 3.0 × 10^9/L.

               -  Neutrophils &lt; lower limit of normal.

               -  Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL.

               -  Lymphocytes &lt; 0.8 × 10^9/L

               -  Platelets &lt; 100 × 10^9/L.

          -  Subjects with severely impaired liver function (Child-Pugh Class C) or end-stage
             renal disease on dialysis or at least 1 of the following:

               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL.

               -  Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of
                  normal.

          -  Subjects taking potent systemic cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole within
             2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before the baseline visit (topical
             agents with limited systemic availability are permitted).

          -  Subjects who have previously received Janus kinase inhibitors, systemic or topical
             (eg, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib, lestaurtinib, pacritinib).
