  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that ACZ can be safely administered concomitantly with TMZ in patients with
      malignant glioma and that this regimen improves patient survival without increasing toxicity
      to an unacceptable level. Information gathered from this study will contribute towards the
      development of a future larger phase II study in these tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are a diverse group of tumors that encompass WHO grade III and WHO grade
      IV, glioblastoma (GBM), tumors. Alkylating chemotherapy is central to the management of
      these tumors and temozolomide (TMZ) is now the most commonly used anti-glioma
      chemotherapeutic [1]. Standard treatment for newly diagnosed malignant glioma involves
      concomitant TMZ and ionizing radiation (IR). Despite its routine use, many patients
      experience minimal benefit from the addition of TMZ [2]. Given that no new chemotherapeutics
      have been approved for GBM in over a decade, identification of strategies to enhance the
      efficacy of TMZ is important. In preliminary work, we identified the proto-oncogene, Bcl-3,
      as a biomarker in glioma that can predict response to TMZ. In examining the mechanism by
      which Bcl-3 promotes resistance to therapy, we identified carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) as a
      unique factor that is both Bcl-3-dependent and induced by TMZ. CAII is potently inhibited by
      the oral CA inhibitor, acetazolamide (ACZ, Diamox), an FDA-approved agent used for a variety
      of medical conditions seen in patients with glioma including epilepsy and raised
      intracranial pressure. Importantly, using patient-derived GBM cells and xenografts we find
      that ACZ sensitizes GBM to TMZ. Specifically, our pre-clinical studies show that daily ACZ
      given in combination with TMZ and extended for 21 days after TMZ initiation significantly
      prolongs survival of animals bearing GBM xenografts compared to TMZ alone.

      Primary Objective: To determine the safety, tolerability and adverse event profile of adding
      acetazolamide to temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To describe objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall
           survival (OS).

        2. To determine the feasibility of accrual, and adequacy of eligibility criteria, by
           defining the proportion of patients enrolled from the eligible cases of malignant
           glioma presented at the weekly multidisciplinary Neuro-oncology tumor board at the
           University of Chicago Medical Center.

        3. To evaluate Bcl-3 expression level within each tumor and preliminarily examine the
           ability of Bcl-3 to predict response to TMZ and the efficacy of adding ACZ.

    <description>Patients will receive daily oral ACZ concomitant with TMZ. ACZ will be initiated at 250 mg twice a day (BID) and then escalated to 500 mg BID. ACZ will be started on the day of TMZ initiation. During the concomitant TMZ/IR phase, ACZ will be continued throughout the course of TMZ and for an extra 10 days after TMZ cessation. During each maintenance cycle, ACZ will be given during TMZ treatment (Days 1-5) and continued for a total of 21 days.</description>
