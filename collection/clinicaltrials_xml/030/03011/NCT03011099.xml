    <description>During the training, subjects will wear a lower extremity exoskeleton robotic walking device. Subjects will participate in individualized treatment sessions which may include: sit to stand, static and dynamic standing balance, weight shifting, walking, turning, and stand to sit. Each training session will last up to 90 minutes (60 minutes of training with 30 minutes for setup, don/doff of device) and training will be held 5 days per week for 3 weeks with a total of 15 sessions. During the training period, subjects will be required to maintain the same amount and level of regular daily physical activity and exercise.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>During the training, subjects will receive conventional physical therapy that is designed to facilitate/promote gait. This will include individualized treatment sessions for each subject and may involve stretching, strengthening, balance training, standing, and gait training. Subjects will not be able to participate in any form of robotic assisted or body weight supported treadmill training. Each training session will last up to 60 minutes and training will be held 5 days per week for 3 weeks with a total of 15 sessions. Consistent with the RET group, subjects will be required to maintain the same amount and level of regular daily physical activity and exercise during study period.</description>
