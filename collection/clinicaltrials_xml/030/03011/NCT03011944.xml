    <textblock>
      A nutrition-focused QIP will be implemented as standard of care at select branches of the
      home health division of the health care system. The QIP will be comprised of two groups of
      patients, Group 1 will consist of hospitalized, at-risk/malnourished patients being
      discharged to home health, and Group 2 will consist of outpatients at-risk/malnourished
      patients enrolled in home health. Both groups will be followed for 90 days post enrollment.
      The QIP groups will be compared to historical controls, concurrent controls, and matched
      concurrent controls across other sites within the health system.
