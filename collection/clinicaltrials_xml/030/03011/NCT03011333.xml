      This is a Phase 2B, randomized, assessor-blind, active- and saline placebo-controlled,
      multicenter study in subjects undergoing augmentation mammoplasty to evaluate the analgesic
      efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HTX-011 when administered via
      ultrasound-guided lateral and medial pectoral nerve block before surgery.

        Each subject must meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:

          1. Is able to provide written informed consent, adhere to the study visit schedule, and
             complete all study assessments.

          2. Is female ≥18 years of age.

          3. Is scheduled to undergo primary bilateral submuscular augmentation mammoplasty.

          4. Has an American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Physical Status of I, II, or III.

          5. Is able to demonstrate motor function by raising both arms above the head unassisted.

          6. Is able to assess sensory function by exhibiting sensitivity to cold in the pectoral
             area (upper outer quadrant).

          7. Subjects are eligible only if all of the following apply:

               1. Not pregnant (female subject of child-bearing potential must have a negative
                  urine pregnancy test at screening and before study drug administration).

               2. Not lactating.

               3. Not planning to become pregnant during the study.

               4. Surgically sterile; or at least 2 years post-menopausal; or have a monogamous
                  partner who is surgically sterile; or is practicing double-barrier
                  contraception; or practicing abstinence (must agree to use doublebarrier
                  contraception in the event of sexual activity); or using an insertable,
                  injectable, transdermal, or combination oral contraceptive approved by the US
                  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for greater than 2 months prior to screening
                  and commits to the use of an acceptable form of birth control for the duration
                  of the study and for 30 days after study drug administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Has a planned concurrent surgical procedure.

          2. Has a pre-existing concurrent acute or chronic painful physical condition that may
             require analgesic treatment in the postoperative period for pain that is not strictly
             related to the augmentation mammoplasty and which may confound the postoperative
             assessments.

          3. Has a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to bupivacaine, or other
             amide-type local anesthetics, or meloxicam.

          4. Has a contraindication/known or suspected hypersensitivity to bupivacaine, meloxicam,
             oxycodone, morphine, or hydromorphone (eg, Dilaudid®).

          5. Has known or suspected daily use of opioids for 7 or more consecutive days within the
             previous 6 months.

          6. Has taken long-acting opioids within 3 days prior to surgery, or have taken any
             opioids within 24 hours prior to study drug administration.

          7. Has taken bupivacaine or any other local anesthetic within 72 hours prior to study
             drug administration other than for pretreatment prior to a needle placement.

          8. Has initiated treatment with any of the following medications within 1 month of study
             drug administration or is taking any of these medications to control pain: selective
             serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
             (SNRIs), gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors.
             If a subject is taking one of these medications for a reason other than pain control,
             she must be on a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to study drug administration.

          9. Has a medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, participating in
             the study would pose a health risk to the subject. Conditions may include any of the
             following:

               1. History of clinically significant cardiac abnormality such as New York Heart
                  Association class III or IV, myocardial infarction, which resulted in
                  significant clinical abnormalities of ECG or function.

               2. Impaired kidney or liver function.

               3. Chronic respiratory disease (compromised function requiring regular
                  bronchodilator treatment).

               4. Rheumatoid arthritis.

               5. Known or suspected coagulopathy or uncontrolled anticoagulation.

               6. Loss of sensation in extremities or significant peripheral neuropathy.

         10. Has uncontrolled anxiety, psychiatric, or neurological disorder that might interfere
             with study assessments

         11. Has any chronic neuromuscular deficit of either pectoral nerve function or
             arm/shoulder/truncal musculature.

         12. Has any chronic condition or disease that would compromise neurological or vascular
             assessments.

         13. Had a malignancy in the last year, with the exception of non-metastatic basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

         14. Has a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse, or a positive drug screen.

         15. Previous participation in an HTX-011 study.

         16. Was administered an investigational product within 30 days or 5 elimination
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to study drug administration, or is planning
             to take another investigational product or undergo another procedure during the
             subject's participation in this study.

         17. Has a body mass index (BMI) &gt;35 kg/m2.
