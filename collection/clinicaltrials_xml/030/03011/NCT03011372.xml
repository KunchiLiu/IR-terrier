    <measure>Overall clinical benefit rate based on response criteria for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with FGFR1 rearrangement</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at protocol-defined timepoints through end of study, up to approximately 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), complete hematologic response (CHR), cytogenetic response, marrow response, or clinical benefit.</description>

    <measure>Duration of response/benefit</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at protocol-defined timepoints through end of study, up to approximately 24 months.</time_frame>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first study drug dose until the date of disease progression or until death due to any cause, whichever is earlier, assessed up to approximately 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the first date of taking study drug until the date of disease progression, as measured by response criteria for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with FGFR1 rearrangement, or until death due to any cause, whichever is earlier.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first study drug dose until death due to any cause, assessed up to approximately 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the first day of taking study drug until death due to any cause. Subjects without death observed at the time of the analysis will be censored at last date known to be alive.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability as assessed by frequency, duration, and severity of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline through 30-35 days after end of treatment, up to 7 months per individual subject</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-emergent AE was defined as an event occurring after exposure to at least 1 dose of study drug. A treatment-related AE was defined as an event with a definite, probable, or possible causality to study medication. A serious AE is an event resulting in death, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is life threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes above. The intensity of an AE was graded according to the National Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03: Grade 1 (Mild); Grade 2 (Moderate); Grade 3 (Severe); Grade 4 (life-threatening).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented lymphoid or myeloid neoplasm with 8p11 rearrangement known to lead to
