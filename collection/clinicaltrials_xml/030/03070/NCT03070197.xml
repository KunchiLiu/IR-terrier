  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 400 Congenital heart disease patients will participate in the research study
      which will include one or more research visits for neurodevelopmental testing, brain MRI,
      and collection of medical history including previously collected genetic sequencing results.
      The investigators will explore the association between genetic variants, neurodevelopmental
      deficits, and brain MRI endophenotype. Analyses will compare groups with and without
      deleterious de novo mutations.

    <description>The investigators will compare groups with respect to achievement, IQ, learning disability, specific neuropsychological domains (e.g., memory, attention, executive functions, and visual-spatial/motor integration), adaptive function, behavior, social cognition and symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, and quality of life. The primary study outcome for this aim will be the WRAT4 composite score.</description>

    <description>The investigators will compare the groups with respect to measured and derived parameters including, but not limited to, 1) regional volumetric and cortical thickness, 2) regional surface metrics, 3) voxel-based DTI eigenvectors and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, and resting state principal component analysis</description>

        Congenital heart disease patients aged 8 years and older with prior whole exome sequencing
        or whole genome sequencing results

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects in whom whole exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing has already been
             performed, either during the CHD GENES study or, for new centers (Utah or
             USCF/Stanford), after trios in existing biobanks undergo analysis by whole exome
             sequencing or whole genome sequencing during the Pediatric Cardiac Genomic Consortium
             2 grant cycle

          2. Presence of deleterious mutations (damaging de novo mutations or stringently defined
             deleterious missense mutations) identified on sequencing (Cases) OR absence of such
             known deleterious mutations (Controls)

          3. Males or females, age â‰¥8 years

          4. Diagnosis of congenital heart disease

          5. Informed consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of cardiac transplant

          2. A cardiac surgical procedure within 6 months of enrollment

          3. Known clinical genetic syndrome, characterized as a monogenic condition with an
             identified gene associated with abnormalities of the brain structure or function,
             structural heart disease, and potentially other associated features.

          4. Presence of CNV known to be clinically pathogenic. Variants will be classified as
             pathogenic using accepted types of variant evidence (e.g., population data,
             computational data, functional data, segregation data) as detailed in the American
             College of Medical Genetics and Genomics &quot; Standards and Guidelines for the
             interpretation of sequence variants&quot; (Richards et al, GIM 2015).

          5. Overwhelming acquired brain injury, such as a major stroke or severe ischemic injury,
             that would overshadow the effect of a genetic mutation on outcome in the opinion of
             the center investigator

          6. Lack of reading fluency in English or Spanish
