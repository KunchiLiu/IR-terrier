      To evaluate the overall survival of HLA-A*0201 positive adult patients with previously
      untreated advanced UM receiving IMCgp100 compared to Investigator's Choice of dacarbazine,
      ipilimumab, or pembrolizumab.

      This Phase II study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMCgp100 compared
      with Investigator's Choice (dacarbazine, ipilimumab or pembrolizumab) in HLA-A*0201 positive
      adult patients with advanced UM treated in the first line setting with no prior systemic or
      liver-directed chemo-, radio- or immune-therapy administered in the advanced setting (prior
      surgical resection of liver metastases and adjuvant systemic therapy are acceptable).
      Comparison of the IMCgp100 efficacy results in this Phase II study will be made with the
      concurrently randomized arm (Investigator's Choice) with a primary endpoint of overall
      survival (OS) and secondary efficacy endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS), objective
      response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and disease control rate (DCR).
