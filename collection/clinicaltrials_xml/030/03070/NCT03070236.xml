  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating how patients feel physically and emotionally after a prior
      breast biopsy for specific breast conditions (including atypical lesions such as atypical
      ductal hyperplasia (ADH), atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), lobular carcinoma in situ
      (LCIS), and/or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS))
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to better understand the experience of women who have been
      diagnosed with certain breast conditions to enable women (and their doctors) to make
      informed decisions about their care.
