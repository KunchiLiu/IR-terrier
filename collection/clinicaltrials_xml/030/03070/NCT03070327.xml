    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, dose escalating, nonrandomized, single-center, phase I study of EGFRt/BCMA-41BBz CAR T cells in patients with a diagnosis of MM or PCL. Dose escalation will follow a standard 3-by-3 escalation design. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be infused with escalating doses of EGFRt/BCMA-41BBz CAR T cells to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed MM or PCL by MSKCC pathologist, with MM
             cells expressing BCMA, previously treated with 2+ prior lines of therapy including an
             IMiD and a PI, either with refractory, persistent, or progressive disease

          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL, direct bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL, AST and ALT ≤3.0x upper limit of
             normal (ULN)

          -  Adequate pulmonary function as assessed by ≥92% oxygen saturation on room air by
             pulse oximetry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Karnofsky performance status &lt;70

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Women and men of childbearing age should use effective
             contraception while on this study and continue for 1 year after all treatment is
             finished

          -  Impaired cardiac function (LVEF &lt;40%) as assessed by ECHO or MUGA scan

          -  Patients with following cardiac conditions will be excluded:

               -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III or IV congestive heart failure

               -  Myocardial infarction ≤6 months prior to enrollment

               -  History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or unexplained syncope,
                  not believed to be vasovagal in nature or due to dehydration

               -  History of severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy

          -  Patients with HIV or active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection are ineligible

          -  Patients with any concurrent active malignancies as defined by malignancies requiring
             any therapy other than expectant observation or hormonal therapy, with the exception
             of squamous and basal cell carcinoma of skin

          -  Patients with a prior allogeneic transplant ARE eligible UNLESS previously or
             currently experienced GvHD that required systemic steroids or other systemic
             lymphotoxic therapy

          -  Patients on systemic steroids (except if solely for adrenal replacement) within two
             weeks of collection

          -  Active auto-immune disease including connective tissue disease, uveitis, sarcoidosis,
             inflammatory bowel disease, or multiple sclerosis, or have a history of severe (as
             judged by the principal investigator) autoimmune disease requiring prolonged
             immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Prior treatment with gene modified T cells

          -  Prior or active CNS involvement by myeloma (eg leptomeningial disease). Screening for
             this, for example, by lumbar puncture, is only required if suspicious symptoms or
             radiographic findings are present

          -  Pre-existing (active or severe) neurologic disorders (e.g. pre-existing seizure
             disorder)

          -  Active uncontrolled acute infections

          -  Any other issue which, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make the
             patient ineligible for the study
