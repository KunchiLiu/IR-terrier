      This randomized phase II/III trial studies docetaxel, antiandrogen therapy, and radiation
      therapy to see how well it works compared with antiandrogen therapy and radiation therapy
      alone in treating patients with prostate cancer that has been removed by surgery. Androgen
      can cause the growth of prostate cells. Antihormone therapy may lessen the amount of
      androgen made by the body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and
      shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. Giving antiandrogen therapy and radiation therapy with or
      without docetaxel after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the benefit of docetaxel as measured by improvement in freedom from progression
      (phase II) and subsequently metastasis free survival (phase III) when given in combination
      with radiation and androgen deprivation in treatment of high risk prostate cancer
      post-radical prostatectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival. II. To assess local time to progression. III. To assess
      undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) with a non-castrate testosterone at 2.5 years
      post treatment.

      IV. To assess the utility of genomic profiling in making adjuvant therapy decisions
      post-prostatectomy.

      V. To assess toxicity of docetaxel in the post-operative setting when combined with
      radiation and androgen deprivation therapy.

      VI. To assess treatment response by genomically defined sub-groups of prostate cancer
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy comprising leuprolide acetate,
      goserelin acetate, bicalutamide, flutamide, or nilutamide for 6 months. Beginning 8 weeks
      after the start of androgen deprivation therapy, patients receive external beam radiation
      therapy (EBRT) for 7.5 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy and EBRT as in Arm I. Within 4-6 weeks
      after completion of radiation therapy, patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) on day
      1 of every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unexpected
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly.

             to study enrollment and given for =&lt; 90 days duration; finasteride or dutasteride
