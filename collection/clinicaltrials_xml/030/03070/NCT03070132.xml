  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of BIIB074 in treating pain
      experienced by participants with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Secondary objectives of this
      study are to investigate the safety and tolerability of BIIB074 in participants with TN and
      to evaluate the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB074.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or positive test result at Screening for hepatitis C virus antibody or
             current hepatitis B infection (defined as positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
             [HBsAg] and/or hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb]).
