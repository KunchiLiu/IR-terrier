  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if daratumumab can help to control
      acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that is
      refractory (does not respond to treatment) or relapsed (comes back after being treated).

      The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days (4 weeks).

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will receive
      daratumumab by vein on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1 and 2, on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles
      3-6, and then on Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond for up to 1 year or unless the disease stops
      responding to treatment, whichever is earlier.

      Participant's first dose will be given over about 4½ hours. After that, each infusion should
      take about 2½ hours.

      In this study, the following will be done to lower the chance of a daratumumab infusion
      related reaction:

        -  Participant will get medications, including steroids, acetaminophen, and/or
           antihistamine before the infusion. If participant is considered high risk, participant
           may also get medications, including inhaled steroids, after the infusion.

        -  The infusion may be slowed down or stopped if participant has a reaction.

        -  Participant may stay overnight in the hospital after the infusion so the study staff
           can check participant's health.

      Participant may ask the study staff for more information about the types of medications
      participant will receive to lower participant's chance of an infusion-related reaction,
      including how they are administered and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue taking the study drug for up to 1 year. Participant will no longer
      be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur,
      or if participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy
      test within 24 hours before participant's first dose of daratumumab.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant may have a physical exam at any of
      participant's study visits.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Cycle 2 (+/- 2 days), participant will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to
           check the status of the disease.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1 and 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3-6:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Cycle 3, you will have an EKG.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a
           pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond (+/- 2 days), participant will have a bone marrow
      aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease. Participant will continue to have these
      tests until participant has a response to the study drug. The study doctor will decide if
      participant will have this test.

      On Day 15 of Cycles 3-6, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Cycle 7 only, participant will have an EKG.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a
           pregnancy test.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 28-35 days after participant's last dose of daratumumab:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have an EKG.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow
           biopsy/aspiration.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a
           pregnancy test.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      The study staff will call participant to ask how participant is doing 1 time each month for
      the first year after participant's end-of-treatment visit, then every 6 months during the
      second year, and then 1 time every year after that. Each call should last about 5 minutes.

      If the disease has responded to treatment and the disease does not come back, blood (about 2
      teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests 1 time each month for the first 2 years after the
      end-of-treatment visit. Participant may have additional follow-up visits as part of
      participant's routine care. This will be discussed with participant.

      This is an investigational study. Daratumumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). It is considered investigational to use it as treatment
      for AML or MDS.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
