  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most youth with MS experience symptoms such as depression and fatigue. In addition,
      cognitive issues, especially with attention and memory occur frequently. However, little is
      known about interventions that might work to improve these symptoms. In other work. the
      investigators have shown that higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower
      levels of depression and fatigue. Importantly, sleep problems are frequently encountered in
      youth with MS, and were seen in 60% of surveyed youth with MS in the investigators
      preliminary work. Whether sleep plays an important role in symptoms in youth with MS, and
      the relationship between sleep and physical activity in youth with MS is unknown.
