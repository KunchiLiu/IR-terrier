    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of intranasal ketamine for adequate
      sedation of children undergoing minor procedures in the Emergency Department. An intranasal
      dose of 10mg/kg will be used in patients requiring procedural sedation in whom intravenous
      access has not already been established. The investigators hypothesize that this dose of
      intranasal ketamine will be able to provide adequate sedation and analgesia for the
      physician to successfully complete the planned diagnostic or therapeutic intervention
      (Pediatr Emer Care 2012;28: 767-70). The primary endpoint will be successful sedation, as
      will be defined by the ability to complete the planned procedure without rescue medication,
      which includes re-dosing of the same medication.
