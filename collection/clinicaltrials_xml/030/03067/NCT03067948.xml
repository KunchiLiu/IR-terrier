  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is a feasibility pilot of an intervention to respond to positive screening
      tests for mental health(MH) and substance use (SU) captured through the Patient Reported
      Outcomes questionnaires (PROs). The PROs are currently performed in the clinic, however, the
      results are neither reviewed with patients nor transmitted to providers. This pilot assesses
      the feasibility of moving the PROs into the clinical realm by having patients review the PRO
      results, identifying an issue to discuss at the patient's next HIV primary care visit, and
      determining whether this process increases discussion of MH and SU disorders in the
      subsequent clinical visit and/or increases referrals to MH and/or SU treatment.

    <description>In the intervention, participants will be given the opportunity to determine which positive screen, if any, that the participant would like to discuss with the participant's provider at the next HIV primary care appointment. The participant will be notified that all positive screens will be shared with the provider prior to the participant's next HIV primary care visit, and that any positive screen the patient has chosen to discuss with the provider will be specified. The provider will receive the PROs result (score, interpretation, and recommendation) prior to the next HIV primary care visit.</description>
