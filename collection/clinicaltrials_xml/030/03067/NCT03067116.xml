      Determine balance changes during pregnancy

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will be tested at enrollment and during weeks 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40 of their
      pregnancy, as well every 4 weeks postpartum up to 6 months. The following protocol will be
      used:

        1. Subjects will also be asked to answer a short health questionnaire.

        2. The following data will be recorded each time: height, minimum stance width,
           circumference measurements of the chest, abdomen, hip and each thigh as well as a
           supine fundal height. A full body side-profile photo was also taken to determine the
           curvature of the spine.

        3. A session questionnaire will be used to determine if the subject had fallen or noticed
           any changes in their daily activity.

        4. In a seated position, the following measurements will be recorded: 1-minute heart rate
           variability (HRV) with paced breathing, temporal scan body temperature, respiration
           rate, heart rate, blood pressure and SpO2 (these last three will be measured
           bilaterally).

        5. Subject will undergo posturography testing using the modified Clinical Testing of
           Sensory Integration in Balance (mCTSIB) protocol: four 30 s tests in the following
           conditions: eyes open on a rigid surface (NSEO), eyes closed on a rigid surface (NSEC),
           eyes open on a compliant surface (PSEO), and eyes closed on a compliant surface (PSEC).

        6. At the end of the posturography testing, heart rate, blood pressure and SpO2 will be
           re-measured bilaterally in the standing and then seated positions, as will be the
           seated HRV.
