  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label study to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of glecaprevir
      (GLE)/pibrentasvir (PIB) in pediatric participants divided into 4 age groups: 3 to &lt; 6, 6 to
      &lt; 9, 9 to &lt; 12, and 12 to &lt; 18 years of age. Within each age group, some participants will
      be enrolled for intensive pharmacokinetics (IPK) to characterize the PK of a particular age
      group and the remainder of participants will be enrolled for the evaluation of safety and
      efficacy of each age group. Intensive PK sampling is designed to allow for dose adjustment,
      based on available PK and clinical data to achieve therapeutic exposures that have been safe
      and efficacious in adults.

      Part 1 of the study will enroll participants into Cohort 1; Cohort 1 will include
      participants who are in 12 to &lt; 18 years of age who can swallow the adult formulation of
      GLE/PIB. Part 2 of the study will enroll participants in the remaining age groups into
      Cohorts 2, 3, and 4; participants in these cohorts will receive the pediatric formulation of
      GLE/PIB. All participants will receive GLE/PIB for 8, 12, or 16 weeks depending on their
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype, cirrhosis, and prior treatment experience status.
