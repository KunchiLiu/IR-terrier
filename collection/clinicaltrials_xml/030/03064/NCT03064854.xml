      The primary purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of PDR001 when administered in combination with
      platinum-doublet chemotherapy in treatment naive patients with PD-L1 unselected, advanced
      NSCLC, and to estimate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of PDR001 in combination with
      platinum-doublet chemotherapy in this patient population.

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has stage IIIB (and is not a candidate for definitive multimodality therapy)
             or has stage IV NSCLC or relapsed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC as follows:

               1. Group A, group B and group C only: Patients not previously treated with any
                  systemic anti-cancer therapy (e.g. cytotoxic drugs, targeted therapy, monoclonal
                  antibody therapy including immunotherapy (e.g. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) or
                  targeted therapies, either experimental or not), with exception of neo-adjuvant
                  or adjuvant therapy as depicted in inclusion criterion 4.

               2. Group D only: Patients who have received only one prior systemic therapy
                  treatment consisting of a PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitor with or without a CTLA4
                  inhibitor for NSCLC, with exception of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy as
                  depicted in inclusion criterion 4. The last dose of prior immunotherapy must
                  have been administered at least 6 weeks prior to the start of study treatment
                  (cycle 1 day 1).

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC that is EGFR Wild-type,
             ALK-negative rearrangement and ROS1-negative rearrangement

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1

          4. Patients with at least 1 measurable tumor lesion as assessed by Computed Tomography
             (CT) Scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) according to RECIST 1.1.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to the planned study
             treatment including gemcitabine, paclitaxel, cisplatin, carboplatin, pemetrexed or
             any known excipients of these drugs

          2. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies, which in
             the opinion of the investigator may pose an increased risk of serious infusion
             reaction.

          3. Patient has history of interstitial lung disease or interstitial pneumonitis,
             including clinically significant radiation pneumonitis (i.e., affecting activities of
             daily living or requiring therapeutic intervention).

          4. History of leptomeningeal metastases

          5. Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune
             disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (Patients with vitiligo,
             type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only
             requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted
             to enroll).

          6. Use of any live vaccines against infectious diseases within 4 weeks of initiation of
             study treatment
