    <description>Subjects will be consented, enrolled and eligibility criteria checked. If the subject is eligible, subject will proceed with the Genio(TM) implant implantation. Four (4) weeks after implantation, the implant will be activated and the subject will be assessed at 1 month plus 1 week, 2, 3, 4 and 6 month(s) after implantation.</description>
