      Guerbet conducted a non-interventional post-marketing surveillance study on its Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agent Dotarem (gadoteric acid/gadoterate meglumine). The
      aim of this study, which was conducted in accordance with section 67, paragraph 6 of the
      German drug regulation, Arzneimittelgesetz, was to gain additional insights into the
      diagnostic efficacy, reliability and safety of Dotarem in routine practice using the most
      up-to-date MRI techniques and application methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic efficacy was assessed by the following endpoints: diagnostic value (&quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot;)
      and imaging quality (5-step scale from &quot;excellent&quot; to &quot;very poor&quot;). Safety was evaluated on
      the basis of the frequency and seriousness of adverse events that occurred following Dotarem
      injection.
