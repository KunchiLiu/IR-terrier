  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of patients with Primary Mitochondrial Disease with either
      signs or symptoms suggestive of myopathy. The Investigator will identify potential patients
      through existing medical records and one on-site visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An observational study of patients with presumed Primary Mitochondrial Disease designed to
      better characterize and correlate symptoms and signs of myopathy and genetic test results
      and the use of commonly prescribed treatments. The study will help define and identify a
      subject population for a future trial of an investigational product to treat primary
      mitochondrial disease associated with signs and symptoms of myopathy.
