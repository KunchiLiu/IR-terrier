      This is a pilot feasibility study testing a mindfulness based intervention with caregivers
      of people with chronic illnesses

      The primary aim of the project is to pilot test the delivery of the Mindfulness Based
      Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) programme to informal caregivers of people with chronic illnesses
      in one region in Ireland so as to determine the feasibility of delivering the intervention
      to caregivers in Ireland.

      A two-group randomised pilot-feasibility trial comparing the MBCT programme (intervention)
      with no programme (control). The MBCT programme is delivered in group format over 8 weeks in
      sessions of 2hours/week. Participants are encouraged to practice mindfulness exercises and
      homework related to cognitive processes between sessions. The programme will be delivered by
      a trained mindfulness teacher. The study sample are caregivers in the Dublin region who are
      members of Family Carers' Ireland. A total of 40 caregivers will be recruited to the study,
      20 per group, based on 1:1 randomisation using a computer-randomised number generator.

      Baseline (pre-intervention) and post intervention participant outcome data (stress,
      mindfulness and QoL) will be collected using self-reported validated scales administered to
      participants by post, with stamped-addressed envelopes provided for return. Other pilot
      measures (i.e. study processes) will be monitored and assessed by the research team to
      determine potential refinement needs. Feasibility outcome data will be collected by the
      research team (including time to recruit, attendance at classes, willingness of participants
      to be randomised) and by the participants (expenses diary) during the study period, using
      predesigned data collection forms. Mean differences with 95% confidence intervals will be
      calculated to determine any significant differences between the groups on the outcomes of
      stress, mindfulness and QoL.
