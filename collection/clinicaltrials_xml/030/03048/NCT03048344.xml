  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 will be conducted as an open-label, non-randomized, non-placebo-controlled dose
      escalation study using pre-specified doses. Subjects with the following advanced
      hematological disorders and no available therapies, and who satisfy all inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled.

      Part 2 will consist of an initial randomized, open-label, 3-sequence, 3-period, crossover
      study to evaluate the bioavailability of a single dose of oral ORH-2014 administered in the
      fed or fasted state (at the MTD or recommended dose identified in Part 1) compared to a
      single dose of IV Trisenox administered at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg.

      Part 3 will be an expansion phase conducted as a single-arm, open-label study to further
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of ORH-2014 at the MTD or recommended dose. Subjects
      with the same disease types as in Part 1 will be enrolled. All subjects will receive oral
      ORH-2014 at the MTD or recommended dose for an initial period of up to 12 weeks.
