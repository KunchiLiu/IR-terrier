  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, treatment with a specific anti-epileptic drug mainly depends on the physicians'
      preference, as there are no studiessupporting the use of one specific anticonvulsant in
      glioma patients. The overall aim of this randomized controlled trial is to directly compare
      the effectiveness of treatment with levetiracetam or valproic acid in glioma patients with a
      first seizure.

    <textblock>
      Currently, treatment of glioma patients with a specific anti-epileptic drug (AED) mainly
      depends on the physicians' preference, as there is no robust evidence from randomized
      controlled trials supporting the use of one specific anticonvulsant above the other in
      glioma patients.

      Levetiracetam and valproic acid are the most commonly used AEDs in glioma patients. Both
      drugs are used for the treatment of seizures, have similar toxicity profiles and are
      non-enzyme inducing AEDs, therefore not interfering with chemotherapeutic drugs. However, it
      is not known whether one drug is more effective than the other in reducing seizures.

    <description>Patients in this treatment arm will receive levetiracetam monotherapy. The dosage depends on the specific treatment step, as indicated in the protocol. In step 1, patients will receive 2x500 mg/d levetiracetam in the form of tablets. In step 2, dosage is increased to 1x250 plus 1x500 mg/d and in step 3 to 2x1000 mg/d levetiracetam. In step 4, levetiracetam is increased to 2x1500mg/d. In the fifth treatment step, patients will receive 2x1500 mg/d levetiracetam, and another AED will be added. The type and dosage of this add-on AED is according to the physician's preference, but in line with current clinical practice in the Netherlands.</description>
