    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the virologic efficacy and safety of three
      antiretroviral (ARV) regimens in HIV-1-infected pregnant women and to compare the safety of
      these regimens for their infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the virologic efficacy and safety of three ARV regimens in
      HIV-1-infected pregnant women: dolutegravir (DTG) plus emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide
      (FTC/TAF), DTG plus emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF), and
      efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF). The study will also
      compare the safety of these regimens for their infants.

      At study entry, mothers will be randomly assigned to either receive DTG plus FTC/TAF (Arm
      1), DTG plus FTC/TDF (Arm 2), or EFV/FTC/TDF (Arm 3) during pregnancy, through delivery, and
      for 50 weeks postpartum.

      Mothers will complete study visits at study entry and every four weeks during pregnancy.
      Study visits for mothers and their infants will occur at delivery and at 6, 14, 26, 38, and
      50 weeks postpartum. Visits for mothers and infants will include physical examinations and
      blood collection. Select study visits may include breast milk collection from mothers who
      breast feed, hair and urine collection, ultrasound scans, and, for a subset of participants,
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans for mothers and their infants.

          -  Mother has confirmed HIV-1 infection based on documented testing of two samples
             collected at different time points:

               -  Sample #1 may be tested using any of the following:

               -  Two rapid antibody tests from different manufacturers or based on different
                  principles and epitopes

               -  One enzyme immunoassay (EIA) OR Western blot OR immunofluorescence assay OR
                  chemiluminescence assay

               -  One HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

               -  One quantitative HIV RNA PCR (above the limit of detection of the assay)

               -  One qualitative HIV RNA PCR

               -  One total HIV nucleic acid test

               -  Sample #2 may be tested using any of the following:

               -  One rapid antibody test. If this option is used in combination with two rapid
                  tests for Sample #1, at least one of the three rapid tests must be FDA-approved
                  and the third rapid test must be from a third manufacturer or based on a third
                  principle or epitope.

               -  One EIA OR Western blot OR immunofluorescence assay OR chemiluminescence assay

               -  One HIV DNA PCR

               -  One quantitative HIV RNA PCR (above the limit of detection of the assay)

               -  One qualitative HIV RNA PCR

               -  One total HIV nucleic acid test.

               -  See the protocol for more information on this inclusion criterion.

          -  At screening, mother is ART-naive, defined as having not received prior ART other
             than ARVs received during prior pregnancies or prior periods of breastfeeding (i.e.,
             receipt of any single, dual, or triple ARV regimen during prior time-limited periods
             of pregnancy and breastfeeding is permitted). Receipt of up to 14 days of ARVs during
             the current pregnancy is permitted prior to study entry so that initiation of ARVs
             during the current pregnancy is not delayed during the study screening period. Note:
             Non-study ART may be initiated in the current pregnancy prior to initiation of the
             study screening process. For eligible participants, enrollment must occur within 14
             days of non-study ART initiation. Receipt of ARVs during a prior pregnancy or prior
             period of breastfeeding must have concluded at least six months prior to study entry.
             See the protocol for more information on this inclusion criterion.

          -  At screening, mother has the following laboratory test results (based on testing of
             samples collected within 14 days prior to study entry):

               -  Grade 1 or lower (less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) alanine
                  aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)

               -  Grade 2 or lower (less than or equal to 1.8 times ULN) creatinine

               -  Grade 2 or lower (greater than or equal to 60 mL/min) estimated creatinine
                  clearance (CrCl; Cockcroft-Gault formula). See the protocol for more information
                  on this inclusion criteria.

          -  At screening and at study entry, no evidence of multiple gestation or fetal
             anomalies, as assessed by best available method

          -  At study entry, gestational age of 14-28 weeks, defined as greater than 13 weeks plus
             six days and less than 28 completed weeks gestation, estimated by best available
             method. Note: For this inclusion criterion and the previous inclusion criterion,
             fetal ultrasound is preferred but not required for purposes of eligibility
             determination. If ultrasound cannot be performed during the study screening period
             (prior to study entry), it must be performed within 14 days after study entry. As
             further explained in the protocol, enrolled participants will not be withdrawn from
             the study based on ultrasound findings obtained after study entry.

          -  At study entry, mother expects to remain in the geographic area of the study site
             during pregnancy and for 50 weeks postpartum

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mother is currently incarcerated or involuntarily confined in a medical facility

          -  Mother is currently receiving:

               -  A psychoactive medication for treatment of a psychiatric illness

               -  Treatment for active tuberculosis

               -  Treatment for active hepatitis C infection

          -  Mother is expected to require treatment with interferon and/or ribavirin for
             hepatitis C infection during the study follow-up period

          -  Mother has a history of any of the following, as determined by the site investigator
             or designee based on maternal report and available medical records:

               -  Hypersensitivity or clinically significant adverse reaction to any of the ARVs
                  included in the three study drug regimens (ever)

               -  Clinically significant heart disease and/or known prolonged corrected QT (QTc)
                  interval (ever)

               -  Suicidal ideation or attempt (ever)

               -  Zika virus infection, diagnosed or suspected, during the current pregnancy

               -  Receipt of any antiretroviral medication within six months prior to study entry,
                  with the exception of receipt of up 14 days of ARVs during the current pregnancy

               -  Receipt of any prohibited medication within 14 days prior to study entry (see
                  the protocol for more information)

               -  Clinically significant acute illness requiring systemic treatment and/or
                  hospitalization within 14 days prior to study entry

               -  Unstable liver disease (defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,
                  coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or persistent
                  jaundice) or known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's
                  syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) within 14 days prior to study entry

          -  Mother or fetus has any other condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator
             or designee, would make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation
             of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives
