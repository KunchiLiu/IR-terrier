    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, parallel-group, adaptive, single dose
      study.

      This study will enroll up to 32 subjects using an adaptive design that can include up to 3
      groups of 8 subjects with different degree of renal impairment and one group of 8 control
      subjects with normal renal function.

      Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered in the study.

      First, approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled with severe renal impairment and matched
      subjects with normal renal function. There will be 8 subjects in each of the following
      groups based on renal function at screening:

        -  Group 1: Healthy subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2)

        -  Group 2: Severe renal impairment subjects (eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2) Based on safety and
           pharmacokinetic (PK) results from subjects with severe renal impairment (Group 2),
           Group 3 (Moderate Renal Impairment) and Group 4 (Mild Renal Impairment) will be
           enrolled if substantial change in the exposure of lasmiditan is observed in subjects
           with severe renal impairment.

                  subjects with isolated laboratory abnormalities (eg, those that do not reflect
                  end-organ dysfunction; for example, elevated bilirubin in Gilbert's subjects) to

              34. Subjects with acute, unstable, or untreated significant medical conditions.
                  Subjects requiring treatment for renal impairment or other chronic disease (eg,
                  well-controlled diabetes, hypertension) must be on a stable treatment plan
                  (medicines, doses, and regimens) for at least 2 weeks (except insulin) prior to
                  Day 1 and during the entire study. Small adjustments in the dosages of some
                  concomitant medications may be permitted during the study, and will be discussed
                  on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, the subjects' treatment history must be
                  reviewed and their enrollment must be agreed to by both the investigator and the
                  sponsor's medical monitor

              35. Positive screening of alcohol and/or drugs of abuse unless results can be
                  explained by a prescription medication

              36. Concurrent use of medications known to affect the elimination of serum
                  creatinine (eg, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [Bactrim®] or cimetidine
                  [Tagamet®]) and competitors of renal tubular secretion (eg, probenecid) within
                  30 days prior to the first dose of study drug or anticipated need for these
                  therapies through the last PK sample
