  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine wether D3 lymph node dissection gives superior
      oncological outcomes compared to standard D2 lymph node dissection in colon cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design involves random allocation of eligible patients to D3 or D2 lymph node dissection
      group in 1:1 ratio. The extent of colonic resection itself is not influenced by the
      randomization and is predefined by the investigator prior to randomization.

      Requirements applied to centers participating in the trial and surgeons performing
      procedures are described in the protocol and refer to center volume and surgeon's experience
      with evaluation of non-editted video-recordings of procedures.

      Routine quality control includes requirement to photograph vessels with the clip to
      determine the extent of lymph node dissection performed and a thorough morphological
      assessment of the specimen.

      After surgery patients are treated according to local standards with no difference wether D2
      or D3 lymph node dissection was performed. Short-term and long-term outcomes are registered
      as per protocol.

      This is a superiority trial evaluating statistical superiority. With the 50% five year
      survival according to national registry for colon cancer, expecting 10% improvement in
      survival with D3 lymph node dissection, enrollment of 768 patients during 3 year accrual
      period followed by 5 year follow up is required for a power of 80%.

      The intent-to-treat principle is used for the data analysis.
