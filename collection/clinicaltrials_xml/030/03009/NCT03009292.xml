      Study E7080-C086-108 is an open-label, single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study
      of lenvatinib (administered orally, once a day [QD]) in Chinese participants with solid
      tumor. A total of 12 participants will be enrolled to evaluate the PK of 24 milligrams (mg)
      QD dosing of lenvatinib.
