  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, three-arm, phase 3 study in men with biochemically
      recurrent prostate cancer and PSA doubling time ≤ 9 months at the time of study entry.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be stratified by PSA doubling time (&lt; 3 months vs. 3-9 months) and randomized
      in 1:1:1 fashion to one of three treatment arms: (1) Control arm consisting of degarelix
      monotherapy, (2) Experimental arm consisting of apalutamide in combination with degarelix,
      and (3) Experimental arm consisting of apalutamide, abiraterone acetate + prednisone, and
      degarelix. Patients will be treated for a maximum duration of 52 weeks and then enter follow
      up phase until the time of PSA progression, development of metastasis, or patient withdrawal
      from study, whichever occurs first. Patients with PSA progression will be followed long term
      until the development of castration resistance, first metastasis, and death.

      The primary endpoint of the study is PSA progression-free survival in the intent-to-treat
      patient population. PSA progression during the 52-week treatment period is defined as a
      rising PSA confirmed on repeat measurement, and at least 25% and 2 ng/mL above nadir or
      baseline, whichever is lower. PSA progression during follow up defined as PSA &gt; 0.2 ng/mL
      confirmed by repeat measurement at least 2 weeks later. Secondary study endpoints include
      PSA progression-free survival in testosterone-evaluable population, 36-month PSA
      progression-free survival rate in both intent-to-treat and testosterone-evaluable
      populations, time to testosterone recovery, time to castration resistance, metastasis-free
      survival, quality of life, and safety. Each experimental arm will be compared against the
      control arm in pair-wise fashion. The study is not powered to detect differences in primary
      or secondary endpoints between the two experimental arms.
