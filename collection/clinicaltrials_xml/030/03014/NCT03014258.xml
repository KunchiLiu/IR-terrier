    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study that will assess the acquisition of immunity to Pf malaria over the
      course of 4 sequential Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) over 3 years, in 10
      healthy adult participants. The study is expected to last for 48 months and will include 28
      healthy male and female volunteers (10 study volunteers and 18 naïve controls to confirm Pf
      infectivity during the 2nd -4th CHMI challenges) ages18 to 45 years, inclusive, from the
      greater Baltimore community.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether protective immunity against
      parasite infection develops following repeat CHMI.

      This is a phase I study that will assess the acquisition of immunity to Pf malaria over the
      course of 4 sequential Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) over 3 years, in 10
      healthy adult participants. 10 subjects will initially be challenged with 5 uninfected
      mosquitoes (mock), followed by 4 challenges with 5 mosquitoes infected with drug sensitive,
      P. falciparum parasites (strain NF54) 2, 8, 20, and 32 months later. For the final three
      infective CMHIs six additional immunologic malaria-naïve subjects will be enrolled and
      challenged as infectivity controls. All volunteers (repeat CHMI subjects and infectivity
      controls) will be evaluated as part of an inpatient stay to diagnose Pf malaria infection
      and treat with Coartem® (artemether/lumefantrine) or Malarone® (Atovaquone/proguanil).
      Inpatient observation will occur from Study Days 9-19 or until three-day directly observed
      therapy for P. falciparum infection is complete and two negative smears separated by a time
      interval &gt;12 hours have been documented. A third negative smear &gt;12 hours after the previous
      two inpatient smears will be documented to affirm malaria cure. The repeat CHMI subjects
      will have additional outpatient visits days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the challenge to obtain
      blood samples to monitor the development of immunity. The study is expected to last for 48
      months and will include 28 healthy male and female volunteers (10 study volunteers and 18
      naïve controls to confirm Pf infectivity during the 2nd -4th CHMI challenges) ages18 to 45
      years, inclusive, from the greater Baltimore community. The primary objective of this study
      is to determine whether protective immunity against parasite infection develops following
      repeat CHMI. The secondary objectives are to: 1) determine whether clinical signs and
      symptoms of malaria decrease in intensity and duration following repeat CHMI, 2) identify
      which PBMCs are activated and proliferate after each exposure to compare responses over time
      and to sequential CHMI, 3) track the production of antibodies that react with P. falciparum
      sporozoites and blood stage parasites.
