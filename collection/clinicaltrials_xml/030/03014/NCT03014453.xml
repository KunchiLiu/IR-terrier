  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD) is a common condition in the low birth weight
      infants.Although most of the BPD symptoms improved after a regular treatment in infancy,
      there are still a few late complications left such as the frequent respiratory symptoms, a
      slower weight gain and even sudden death. These late complications have made so much trouble
      to the healthcare of BPD infants.How to find the risk factors and to reduce the prevalence
      of these late symptoms becomes necessary. It has been reported that gastroesophageal
      reflux(GER)is a long-lasting form in the extremely premature infants with
      BPD,however,whether it serves as a potential risk for the late complications is still
      unclear.In this study, a cohort of BPD infants was observed with the late complications
      obtained by a monthly followed up for 12 months after discharge, the prevalence and risk
      factors were analyzed by Cox's proportional hazards regression model.As one of the risk
      factors, GER was verified whether to play a critical role in these late complications.
