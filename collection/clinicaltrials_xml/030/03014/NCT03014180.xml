    <textblock>
      The purpose of the LEVEA study is to assess the performances of a new automatic left
      ventricular auto threshold (LVAT) algorithm (In-Clinic LVAT algorithm) when used by
      physicians during in-hospital follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;In-Clinic LVAT&quot; feature is a non CE-marked feature designed to be activated by the
      physician during 2 hospital follow-ups:

        -  first visit: planned to be conducted 15 days maximum after inclusion

        -  second visit: planned to be conducted between 1 and 3 months after the first visit The
           evaluation consists in the comparison between the threshold value provided by the
           algorithm and the threshold value obtained manually by the physician.
