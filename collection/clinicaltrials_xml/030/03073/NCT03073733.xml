  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the changes in visual function at 12 months following a single
      injection of human retinal progenitor cells compared to untreated controls in a cohort of
      adult subjects with RP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no effective treatment for RP; once photoreceptors are lost, they do not
      regenerate. The rate of deterioration of vision varies from person to person, with most
      people with RP legally blind by age 40. Preclinical studies demonstrated that
      transplantation of retinal progenitor cells into the eye can result in both photoreceptor
      replacement and significant slowing of host photoreceptor loss. Thus, the primary goal of
      this therapy is to preserve, and potentially improve, vision by intervening in the disease
      at a time when dystrophic host photoreceptors can be protected and reactivated. Based on the
      demonstration of acceptable safety and tolerability in a phase 1/2a study, this phase 2b
      study is designed as a controlled comparison of the changes in visual function and
      functional vision in subjects who receive a single jCell injection in comparison to a
      comparable untreated control group of subjects with RP.
