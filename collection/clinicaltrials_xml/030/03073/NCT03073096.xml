  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is the build-up of lymph fluid in the body's tissue causing chronic, debilitating
      swelling. This commonly occurs as a result of a disruption of the lymphatic system during
      lymph node dissection surgeries. In melanoma patients, the incidence of lymphedema ranges
      from 5-10% in the arms following an axillary dissection, and 28-40% in the legs following
      groin dissection. LYMPHA (LYmphatic Microsurgical Preventive Healing Approach) is an
      innovative microsurgical technique where blocked lymphatic vessels are drained into the
      blood circulation by surgically creating a shunt between a lymphatic channel and a blood
      vessel called a lymphatic-venous bypass. Recently, LYMPHA has been shown to prevent
      lymphedema when performed at the time of nodal dissection. We propose a prospective pilot
      study evaluating the practice of the LYMPHA technique for the primary prevention lymphedema
      at The Ottawa Hospital. The novel use of the LYMPHA technique holds the potential to prevent
      lymphedema rather than to attempt to treat it once it has already progressed and as a result
      will not only improve the quality of life of the cancer patients, but also decrease health
      care costs associated with treating lymphedema.

      Consenting patients will have the LYMPHA procedure at the time of planned axillary or groin
      dissection surgery for the prevention of upper and lower extremity lymphedema, respectively.
      The node dissection will be performed by Dr. Nessim, while the LYMPHA technique will be
      performed by the plastic surgeon, Dr. Momtazi, trained in microsurgical technique. The
      LYMPHA procedure consists of performing lymphatic-venous anastomoses (LVA) at the time of
      the node dissection. Patent blue dye will be injected into the patient approximately 10
      minutes before skin incision. This will allow mapping of the lymphatic channels for
      identification for bypass. The node dissection will then be performed with preservation of
      the saphenous vein in the leg and the anterior branch of the axillary vein in the axilla.
      Afferent lymphatic vessels will be sutured into the saphenous vein or a branch of the
      axillary vein distal to a competent valve, respectively. The total duration of the surgery
      is approximately 3 hours. The LYMPHA technique accounts for an additional 30 minutes to the
      standard 2-2.5 hours allocated to the node dissection.

      Pre-surgery, patients will have baseline limb circumference measurements of both the
      surgery-affected and unaffected limbs (arms or legs). Patients will be followed up
      clinically at every 3 months up to a year, and then again at the second year. At each
      follow-up visit, patients will have a physical examination and their circumferential limb
      measurements will be taken with measuring tape at three specific intervals up the limb.
      Patients will also fill out a limb lymphedema-specific quality of life questionnaire
      (LYMQOL) administered pre- and post-surgery.

      a) The primary objective of this pilot study is to offer the LYMPHA surgery to all patients
      requiring axillary or groin dissection as part of their lymphadenectomy in order to
      i.determine the consent rate, ii.establish the ability to obtain follow-up data,
      iii.estimate the success rate of the LYMPHA procedure, iv. obtain preliminary evidence of
      efficacy of the LYMPHA procedure in preventing lymphedema, v. obtain limb-specific quality
      of life information pre- and post- surgery, vi.design a protocol for a randomized controlled
      trial comparing lymphedema rates in patients receiving a lymphadenectomy + lymphatic-venous
      bypass versus lymphadenectomy alone.

For example, patients undergoing an axillary dissection will have the circumference of their wrist taken, and then again 4 cm proximal to the wrist, then 8 cm proximal to the wrist, and so forth. The method will be used for the legs but starting at the ankle. Volume will be calculated indirectly, using Dr. Brorson's truncated cone method.</description>
