    <textblock>
      This is a crossover study of Vigil, Atezolizumab and their combination in patients who have
      tumor harvested at surgery and successful manufacturing of Vigil but are ineligible for
      CL-PTL-119 (the VITAL study).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label intra-patient crossover study of Vigil, the checkpoint
      inhibitor Atezolizumab and the combination of the two agents, in patients with epithelial
      ovarian cancer, or other gynecological cancers (i.e., cervical, uterine). Eligible patients
      will be randomized to receive two cycles of Vigil alone or two cycles of atezolizumab alone,
      followed by combination treatment with the two agents.This study is intended as a companion
      study to protocol CL-PTL-119, A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Phase 3 trial
      of Vigil Engineered Autologous Tumor Cell Immunotherapy in Subjects with Stage IIIb-IV
      Ovarian Cancer in Clinical Complete Response following Surgery and Primary Chemotherapy,
      otherwise known as the VITAL study. Patients who have tumor harvested at surgery and Vigil
      successfully manufactured, but then are ineligible for randomization onto the VITAL study,
      will be offered the opportunity to participate in this protocol.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be enrolled into two cohorts:
Cohort A, Patients with ovarian cancer who failed to meet the eligibility criteria for Protocol CL-PTL-119 because of failure to achieve a complete clinical response following primary debulking surgery and standard paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy, and have received no more than 2 additional chemotherapy regimens for platinum resistant/refractory disease after their primary treatment.
Cohort B, patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria for Protocol CL-PTL- 119 because of a histologic diagnosis of another gynecological cancer (i.e., cervical, uterine) and not ovarian cancer.
Eligible patients will be randomized to receive two cycles of either Vigil alone or Atezolizumab alone, then followed by combination treatment with the two agents.</intervention_model_description>
