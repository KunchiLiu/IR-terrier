  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will be conducted in two parts. The first part will consist of selecting
      appropriate screening and assessment tools for Veterans undergoing elective surgery and
      identifying the number of Veterans who are malnourished and at risk of malnutrition. The
      second portion of the study will be to determine if a protein-enhanced diet before and after
      surgery will improve function and postoperative outcomes and compare the results to an
      education control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In year 1 of the two-part research study, an observational, prospective study of 75 Veterans
      preparing for elective surgery will be conducted. The purpose of this study will be to
      select appropriate nutrition screening and assessment tools and to employ them to
      characterize malnutrition prevalence and severity and establish cut-off values associated
      with malnutrition in this population. In years 2-5 of the research two-part research study,
      a pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted. The purpose of this study will be
      evaluate the feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of a perioperative protein-enhance
      intervention compared to an educational control. Veterans who are malnourished or at risk of
      being malnourished will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to either an education
      (nutritional counseling) control or high-protein perihabilitation arm. Participants in the
      high-protein perihabilitation arm will be provided with high quality protein supplements
      that will bring their protein intakes to at least 30 grams for 3 meals per day. The study
      will take place two weeks prior to an elective abdominal or GI surgery and will continue 4
      weeks post surgery.
