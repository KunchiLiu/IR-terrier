      The objective is to demonstrate the performances of STA® - Apixaban Calibrator &amp; STA® -
      Apixaban Control used in combination with STA® - Liquid Anti-Xa to measure apixaban
      concentration in plasma. Anti-Xa results will be compared to LCMS (liquid chromatography -
      mass spectrometry) for validation of the assay. For this study, the anti-Xa assay will be
      performed on fresh samples only.

      The results will be used to complete results obtained previously on frozen samples.

      About 60 samples from patients on apixaban meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      included in this study. Two sites will be in charge of sample recruitment and anti-Xa
      testing. A third site will be in charge of LCMS testing.
