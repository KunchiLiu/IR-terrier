  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous study, on which this study is based, found that a diet higher in fruits and
      vegetables, beta-carotene, vitamin C, alpha-tocopherol, and fish oils (specifically
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) was positively associated with
      periodontal healing after sanative therapy (NCT02291835). The investigator's next step, in
      the present study, is to determine long-term benefits of sanative therapy in which patients
      have regular maintenance hygiene cleanings on periodontal health. Specifically, the
      relationship between intakes of specific foods, nutrients and supplements with clinical
      periodontal outcomes will be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a chronic oral infection that results in the breakdown of connective tissue
      and alveolar bone that support the teeth. Bacteria and the body's own immune system mediate
      the severity of periodontitis, where teeth may become loose, fall out or have to be removed.
      Sanative therapy is a non-surgical process involving mechanical debridement of bacterial
      biofilms on roots of teeth, below the gum line. Participants in this present study
      previously underwent sanative therapy several years ago and have been attending the clinic
      for regular maintenance appointments to maintain periodontal health. While significant
      associations were observed with higher intakes of fruits and vegetables and specific
      nutrients (vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, fish oils) within a few months after sanative
      therapy, this study will follow-up these findings to determine if such relationships persist
      during a period of relatively stable periodontal health. Given new insights into a potential
      role of flavonoids in maintaining periodontal health, this aspect will also be studied. The
      overall objective is to determine if higher intakes of foods, nutrients and supplements
      known to have osteogenic and immunomodulatory effects are associated with improved clinical
      outcomes in individuals who previously underwent sanative therapy. At the regular
      maintenance appointment, clinical measures will be evaluated (clinical attachment loss,
      probing depth, bleeding on probing, plaque index). As well, the following will be evaluated:
      dietary intakes of macronutrients and micronutrients using the Block 2015 food frequency
      questionnaire; intakes of fruit, vegetables and fiber using the Block Dietary
      Fruit-Vegetable-Fiber Screener; nutritional supplement use and tea intake using specially
      developed questionnaires and salivary markers of inflammation using biochemical assays.
