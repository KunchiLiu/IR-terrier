  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to describe the outcomes related to physical activity, activity of
      disease, quality of life, work productivity and safety in Latin-American patients with
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) treated with tofacitinib or biological DMARDs after failure to
      respond to conventional DMARDs in real-life conditions. This will be a non-interventional,
      hybrid study (prospective and retrospective data collection) comparing tofacitinib to
      biologic DMARD treatments in patients with RA after failure of conventional DMARDs. The
      population will be composed by adult patients over 18 years of age diagnosed with RA and who
      have been prescribed tofacitinib or any biological DMARDs.
