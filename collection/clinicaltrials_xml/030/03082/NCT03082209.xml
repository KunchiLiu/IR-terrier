  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study to determine the determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase two dose (RPTD), and evaluate the safety,
      efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-621 for participants with previously
      treated solid tumors or hematologic malignancies. The study will consist of 2 segments:
      Segment I (Dose Escalation) and Segment II (Dose Expansion).
