    <textblock>
      This PAR (participatory action research) study to improve antibiotic prescribing quality in
      a GPC (general practitioner cooperative) during OOH-care (out-of-hours-care) uses a mixed
      methods approach using qualitative as well as quantitative techniques. In a first
      exploratory phase we will work on partnership development and mapping the existing issues.
      In a second phase the focus will be on facilitating change and implementing interventions
      through PDSA (plan do study act) cycles. In a third phase outcomes on prescribing quality
      during and outside office hours will be evaluated. Equally important is the process
      evaluation and theory building on improving antibiotic prescribing through PAR.

    <time_frame>year 1</time_frame>
    <description>Using antibiotic prescribing quality indicators (APQI) feedback on the antibiotic prescription rates of the GPC will be generated. For the six most common indications for antibiotic prescribing (in descending order: acute bronchitis (ICPC (6) code R78), acute upper RTI (R74), cystitis/other urinary infection (UTI; U71), acute tonsillitis (R76), acute/chronic sinusitis (R75), and acute otitis media (H71)) and for pneumonia (R81) values of three valid antibiotic prescribing quality indicators (APQI)quality indicators will be calculated and fed back: (5)
= the percentage of patients with age and/or gender limitation prescribed an antibiotic;
= a. and receiving the guideline recommended antibiotic;
= a and receiving quinolones.</description>

    <description>Qualitative and quantitative results of phase 1 will be fedback to the group of GPs. In reflective peer group sessions the issues and problems will be explored and interventions will be designed taking into account previous work.
The implemented interventions and changes will be studied based on both outcome as process indicators. ESACs' Antibiotic Prescribing Quality Indicators (APQI) will be used to assess quality of antibiotic prescribing. Pocess indicators will depend on the chosen interventions.</description>
