  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non interventional prospective study. Centers will enroll adult participants with
      partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation for whom the clinician has
      decided to initiate ESL as an adjunctive therapy prior to the decision to take part in this
      study. Participants to be enrolled into the study will receive eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL)
      either as an adjunctive therapy to one baseline antiepileptic drug (AED) or to at least two
      baseline AEDs. Participants will be seen at baseline and at a follow-up visit after
      approximately 6 months to assess retention, efficacy, tolerability, quality of life
      (optional), and cognitive performances (optional).
