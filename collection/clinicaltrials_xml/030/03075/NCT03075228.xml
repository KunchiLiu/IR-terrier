  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The microbial composition in the small intestine (SI) differs largely from the
      composition in feces. Many physiological processes related to health, such as
      immunoregulation and metabolic programming, mainly take place in the SI. Therefore, the SI,
      from a microbiota perspective, is as relevant as the large intestine. There are indications
      that microbiota composition is different in lean and obese subjects, and is related to
      insulin resistance. However, these indications are mainly based on the analysis of fecal
      samples. Therefore, analysis of the microbiota composition in the more proximal part of the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract may provide new insights into the microbial species that are
      involved or related to metabolic homeostasis at that location. The IntelliCapÂ® CR system
      offers a minimally invasive tool that is able to collect reliable samples in the SI, as was
      shown by NIZO in a clinical validation study. The main aim of the current study is to
      explore and compare the upper GI microbiota composition in lean and obese subjects, in order
      to generate new leads for development of products that may target the upper GI microbiota
      community or specific species thereof, which may impact the maintenance of metabolic
      homeostasis. This may provide new opportunities for the treatment, reduction or prevention
      of overweight and/or obesity or insulin resistance.
