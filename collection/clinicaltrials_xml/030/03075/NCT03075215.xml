  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To learn in a general Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-D) population,
      which optimization techniques are used and how effective they are. It will compare 12-month
      response rates among different optimization methods and characterize which selected subject
      subgroups achieve better response than others.

      A subset of SMART Registry subjects will contribute to the NG4 Post Market Clinical Follow
      Up (PMCF) Cohort whose objective is collecting data on the NG4 CRT-D features and device
      usage in a real world setting and monitor long term safety associated with these devices to
      support CE Mark.
