      The purpose of the study is to determine how associations between drugs and the places where
      they are experienced influence drug seeking, mood and acute drug responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Learned associations between drug effects and the people, places, and paraphernalia (cues)
      linked with drug experiences are a major barrier to the treatment of drug addiction. These
      links are remarkably persistent and can cause relapse to drug taking even after long periods
      of abstinence. They are also key features in some of the foremost theories of addiction, yet
      there is little clinical evidence of how these associations are formed and how they come to
      profoundly control behavior. The long-term goal of this research is to understand how drug
      cues become powerfully linked with drug experiences and their influence on mood and
      behavior. In the proposed project, the investigators will determine how associations between
      drugs and the places where they are experienced influence drug seeking, mood and acute
      responses to the drug. The hypothesis is that drug-paired environments will induce approach
      behavior and also alter acute subjective responses to the drug.This knowledge will lead to
      novel treatment strategies to counteract the effects of drug cues on mood and behavior, and
      also to prevent relapse.

    <measure>Change in time spent in drug-paired room</measure>

    <description>The amount of time spent in the room paired with drug is calculated during a 10 min exploration test. Exploration tests are conducted at the orientation session (pre-test) and then again at the testing session (post-test). The difference between the pre- and post-tests is calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Self-reported drug effects are measured 30min before drug administration and at 30min intervals after drug administration for 4h during each conditioning sessions</time_frame>
