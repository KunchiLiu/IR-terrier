  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will examine the feasibility of conducting a strict whole-food, plant-based
      dietary intervention with intensive group education in women with stable metastatic breast
      cancer currently undergoing conventional treatments. In addition, this research will provide
      preliminary data on dietary intakes and the effect of plant-based nutrition on numerous
      outcomes reflecting cancer prognosis and overall health using advanced imaging, various
      blood biomarkers linked to cancer progression, and numerous symptom questionnaires.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with a confirmed diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer on systemic treatment
             with radiographically stable disease, demonstrated by at least one imaging test
             (Computerized tomography (CT), bone scan, or positron emission tomography (PET))
             within last 6 months which was interpreted as stable compared to prior imaging study.

          -  No new clinical symptoms suggestive of progression of disease.

             emission tomography (PET).

          -  Systemic therapy may consist of any conventional treatment including anti-hormonal,
             cytotoxic, targeted monoclonal antibody or small molecule kinase inhibitors or any
             combination of the above.

          -  Diagnosed eating disorder.

          -  Uncontrolled diarrhea.

          -  Repeated hyperkalemia (Potassium &gt; 5.1 on more than 2 tests) in the past 30 days.

          -  Major surgery within 2 months of starting study program and patients must have
             recovered from any effects of major surgery
