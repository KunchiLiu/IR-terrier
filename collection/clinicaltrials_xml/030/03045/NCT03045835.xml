  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Baska mask is a new novel supraglottic airway device with many salient features. The
      investigators aim to determine the benefit of BASKA mask as an effective airway device for
      laparoscopic surgery, and whether it can even substitute endotracheal intubation, in order
      to smoothen the surgery and anaesthesia process in ambulatory care setting as well as reduce
      perioperative complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient's satisfaction and smooth process is crucial for ambulatory care surgeries. Conduct
      of Anaesthesia including choice of airway devices play an important role. Endotracheal
      intubation has long been regarded as the technique of choice for airway management in
      laparoscopic surgery. However, there is currently an emerging interest in laryngeal mask as
      the substitute for endotracheal tube in laparoscopic surgery especially for ambulatory care
      setting.

      The increased abdominal pressure secondary to gas insufflation in Laparoscopic surgery
      demands a good supraglottic airway device with features of good seal, aspiration prevention
      and effective ventilation.

      Few studies have evaluated the performance Baska® Mask for various type of surgery and had
      obtained high &quot;first-attempt&quot; success rate, easy insertion and a good oropharyngeal leak
      pressure above 30cmH2O with low complications such as sorethroat, dysphonia and dysphagia.

      However, study regarding comparison of Baska® mask with endotracheal tube has not been
      carried out before. Therefore, the investigators would like to evaluate this novel device in
      comparison with endotracheal tube for laparoscopic surgery in our centre.

      This will be a prospective randomized controlled study in University Malaya Medical Centre
      to compare Baska® mask with the conventional laryngoscope-guided endotracheal intubation for
      laparoscopic surgeries as daycare basis.

      The investigators would like to study the efficacy of this device in term of : time to
      effective airway insertion, efficacy of airway seal, post-operation device of complications.

    <measure>oropharyngeal leak pressure (OPL) of the device during operation</measure>
    <time_frame>during operative duration</time_frame>
    <description>the above pressure is measured by performing the maneuver: the expiratory valve of the anaesthetic machine is closed and with a fixed gas flow of 3 L/min, the airway pressure at which equilibrium is reached is recorded. Maximal allowable airway pressure is 40 cm H2O [ OLP is measured at following timeframe - T1: immediately post intubation; T2 : before CO2 insufflation; T3 : after CO2 insufflation; T4 and beyond : each change of position as required during operation (eg. Trendelenburg, reverse Trendelenburg, left tilt)</description>
