  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, prospective study will characterize the impact of three approved
      first and second generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors on cardiovascular and
      metabolic risk factors in chronic phase CML (CP-CML) patients who are TKI naive and
      initiating first-line TKIs in routine clinical practice in the US. All treatment decisions
      will be determined at the discretion of the treating physician(s) and data identifying the
      cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors will be collected. Additional fasting blood
      samples (collected following 8 hours of fasting) will be collected during standard of care
      (SOC)/routine office visits. Additional research imaging will be performed and will be
      reviewed by core imaging laboratory. As the study is collecting data on management of CML,
      this study will not influence the prescribing or management practices at participating
      sites.
