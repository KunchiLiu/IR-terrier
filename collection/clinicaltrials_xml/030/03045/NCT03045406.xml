        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consecutive patients with a newly diagnosed, objectively confirmed: symptomatic or
             unsuspected, proximal lower-limb DVT or symptomatic PE or unsuspected PE in a
             segmental or more proximal pulmonary artery;

          -  Any type of cancer (other than basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin,
             primary brain tumor or intracerebral metastasis and acute leukemia);

          -  Signed and dated informed consent of the patient, available before the start of any
             specific trial procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  age &lt;18 years;

          -  ECOG Performance Status III or IV;

          -  life expectancy of less than 6 months;

        Related to anticoagulant treatment:

          -  administration of therapeutic doses of LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin
             (UFH) for more than 72 hours before randomization;

          -  3 or more doses of a vitamin K antagonist before randomization;

          -  thrombectomy, vena cava filter insertion, or thrombolysis used to manage the index
             episode;

          -  indication for anticoagulant treatment for a disease other than the index VTE
             episode;

        Related to bleeding risk:

          -  thienopyridine therapy (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) or aspirin over 165 mg
             daily or dual antiplatelet therapy;

          -  active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding contraindicating anticoagulant treatment;

          -  recent (in the last 1 month prior to randomization) brain, spinal or ophthalmic
             surgery

          -  hemoglobin level lower than 8 g/dL (5.0 mmol/L) or platelet count &lt;75x10^9/L or
             history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia;

          -  creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml /min based on the Cockcroft Gault equation;

          -  acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, liver cirrhosis; or an alanine
             aminotransferase level 3 times or more and/or bilirubin level 2 times or more higher
             the upper limit of the normal range;

          -  uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP&gt; 180 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg despite
             antihypertensive treatment);

          -  concomitant use of strong inhibitors or inducers of both cytochrome P-450 3A4 and
             P-Glycoprotein;

        Standard criteria:

          -  bacterial endocarditis;

          -  hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of study drug;

          -  patients participation in other pharmaco therapeutic program with an experimental
             therapy that is known to effect the coagulation system;

          -  childbearing potential without proper contraceptive measures, pregnancy, or breast
             feeding;

          -  any condition that as judged by the Investigator would place the subject at increased
             risk of harm if he/she participated in the study.
