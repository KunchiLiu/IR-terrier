      Background: Endocrine therapy is an effective and safe treatment for hormone receptor
      positive breast cancer. Unfortunately , endocrine treatment resistance occurs and there is
      an urgent need for treatment alternative. Laboratory researches and clinical case reports
      indicate that hormone receptor-high expressed breast cancer patients may potentially benefit
      from high-dose Tamoxifen therapy, providing a new option for treatment strategy.

      Aim: To explore the efficacy and safety of high-dose Tamoxifen to advanced hormone
      receptor-high expressed endocrine therapy resisted breast cancer.

      Methods: Eligible patients will be treated with tamoxifen 100 mg/d. Blood and tumor samples
      will be obtained from the patients.

      Primary endpoint: clinical benefit rate at 16 weeks(CBR)
