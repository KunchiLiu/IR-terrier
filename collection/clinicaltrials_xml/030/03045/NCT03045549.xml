  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel kinematic biofeedback system
      - SWORD Phoenix- in the rehabilitation after total hip replacement . SWORD Phoenix allows
      the patients to perform independent rehabilitation sessions at home, under remote monitoring
      from the clinical team. The investigators hypothesise that the clinical outcomes of a
      home-based rehabilitation program will be at least similar to the outcomes of a traditional
      home-based rehabilitation with face-to-face sessions. This is a randomised controlled trial
      with active comparator. Patients will be enrolled and allocated pre-operatively into 2
      groups: intervention group and control group. Both groups will perform 8 weeks of
      rehabilitation starting on day 7 after surgery. The intervention group will perform daily
      rehabilitation sessions at home using SWORD Phoenix, under remote monitoring from a physical
      therapist. The control group will perform 1h rehabilitation sessions 3 times a week, at
      home, given by a physical therapist. Outcomes will be measured at weeks 4 and 8. The primary
      outcome is the performance in the Timed-up-and-Go (TUG) test between in each patient in
      comparison with the pre-operative score. Secondary outcomes will be measured in terms of: a)
      range of motion of the hip joint (flexion/extension/abduction/adduction/internal and
      external rotation); b) Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; c) quality of life, as measured by
      the SF-36 scale.

    <description>SWORD Phoenix will be used independently by the patients to perform rehabilitation sessions at home, under remote monitoring from the clinical team. A tailored rehabilitation program will be prescribed, based on the following principles:
STAGE 1 (Weeks 0-6) Open kinetic chain exercises without added resistance: lying, sitting and standing (with support) Strengthening of hip flexors and abductors (mainly) Ice pack application STAGE 2 (weeks 7-8) Open kinetic chain exercises with added resistance: lying, sitting (high chair) and standing (with progression to standing without support) Strengthening of hip flexors and abductors (mainly) Ice pack application after each session</description>

    <description>Patients will perform 3 weekly rehabilitation sessions, with a duration of 1 hour, for 8 weeks, provided by a physical therapist. The rehabilitation program will respect the following principles:
STAGE 1 (Weeks 0-6) Soft tissue massage Active assisted mobilization of the hip joint to increase range of motion (avoiding internal rotation and adduction) Gait training with bilateral assistive devices Isometric exercises progressing to open chain, low-impact, concentric exercises with strengthening of hip abductors and flexors Ice pack application STAGE 2 (weeks 7-8) Soft tissue massage Gait training with progressive withdrawal of assistive devices Balance exercises with progression to one-leg support Open-chain strengthening exercises against resistance with progression to closed-chain exercises Ice pack application</description>
