  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multicenter, patient registry to observe and assess
      the real-world use and tolerability of Orenitram (treprostinil). Patients who are newly
      initiated on Orenitram for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or who
      transition from another prostacyclin therapy will be evaluated for 52 weeks to observe
      dosing regimens, titration schedules, prostacyclin-related adverse events (AEs), and
      clinical outcomes of interest.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is newly prescribed on Orenitram, per the package insert indication, and
             plans to initiate therapy with this medication, or has been receiving Orenitram for
             21 or fewer days.

          2. The patient agrees to dosing, prostacyclin-related AE of interest record keeping,
             survey participation during designated time periods, and recording any medication
             changes and use for the duration of the study.

          3. The patient has the ability to answer surveys, use the diary in English, and has
             access to the internet.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has previously received Orenitram for more than 21 days.

          2. The patient is currently receiving epoprostenol therapy or has received epoprostenol
             within 30 days of enrollment (except if received during acute vasodilator testing).

          3. The patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or device study
             within 30 days of enrollment. Co-enrollment in other noninterventional studies is
             allowed.
