      The PREVENTER Trial aims to compare the use of perioperative pharmacologic prophylaxis
      (subcutaneous heparin) with intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCs) to the use of
      IPCs alone for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after radical prostatectomy
      (RP).

      The PREVENTER Trial aims to compare the use of perioperative pharmacologic prophylaxis
      (subcutaneous heparin) with intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCs) to the use of
      IPCs alone for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after radical prostatectomy
      (RP). Currently, there is no standard practice for VTE prophylaxis after RP with the
      American Urological Association recommending &quot;pharmacological or pneumatic mechanical
      prophylaxis&quot; for high risk patients. Prior studies showed 30% of patients in the United
      States received no perioperative prophylaxis and less than 20% received pharmacologic
      agents, compared to 98% of patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis in the United
      Kingdom. Some urologists prescribe patients low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after
      discharge for up to 30 days after surgery. Additionally, there are no established risks of
      pharmacologic prophylaxis for RP patients, but some urologists express concern about the
      potential impact of prophylaxis on the rate of postoperative lymphoceles or hematomas. At
      Johns Hopkins, patients do not routinely receive pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in the
      perioperative setting for RP. Given the lack of standard practice and implications for
      patient safety, the investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      impact of perioperative pharmacologic prophylaxis on VTE following RP hypothesizing that it
      will prevent VTE events without significantly impacting the rate of postoperative bleeding
      or lymphoceles.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptomatic venous thromboembolism</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease that includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The primary outcome is diagnosis of DVT or PE within 30 days after surgery due to imaging (any method, most commonly lower extremity ultrasound or computed tomography scan with pulmonary embolus protocol) prompted by symptoms of a DVT (lower extremity swelling, pain, fever of unknown origin) or PE (chest pain, shortness of breath, hypoxemia, tachycardia or fever of unknown origin, productive cough with bloody sputum).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptomatic postoperative fluid collection</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is defined as a surgical or pelvic fluid collection diagnosed as a hematoma (blood collection, with or without infection) or lymphocele (collection of lymph fluid in the pelvis) due to symptoms (fever, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, anemia, high surgical drain output) within 30 days after surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Major postoperative bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This additional primary outcome includes the development and diagnosis of any major clinically recognized bleeding event within 30 days after surgery requiring &gt;1 unit of packed red blood cell transfusion, intervention to stop bleeding, or return to the operating room.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of any venous thromboembolism</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>DVT or PE diagnosed for any reason within 30 days after surgery. This includes any diagnosed DVT or PE as described in the primary outcome plus any additional DVTs or PEs diagnosed at 30 day screening lower extremity ultrasound for patients opting to undergo screening bilateral lower extremity Duplex ultrasound at 30 days who do not have symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated blood loss during surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The total recorded intraoperative estimated blood loss reported at the end of the surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical drain output after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Length of stay in hospital (usually 1 to 2 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The total output from any surgical drain left in place (not all patients will necessarily have a surgical drain) after surgery and until discharge from the hospital (usually 1 to 2 days). Drain output, if one is left in place after discharge, will not count toward this secondary outcome.</description>
