        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult male or female subjects between ages 45-99 years of age.

          2. CLI, with minor tissue loss (Rutherford Category 5)

          3. Ankle pressure (AP) ≤70 mmHg or TP ≤50 mmHg in the index leg. If a subject has both
             ABI &gt;1.4 and TP is not measureable, inclusion may be based on TcPO2 ≤30 mmHg.

          4. Subject unsuitable for revascularization (by any method) in the index leg .

          5. Ischemic wounds in the index leg stable for at least 2 weeks.

          6. Ischemic wounds in the index leg without tendon or bone exposure.

          7. Under treatment for cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
             diabetes, in accordance with applicable guidelines. Concomitant therapy with a statin
             and an anti-platelet agent for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.

          8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and must be willing to use at least one reliable form of birth control
             throughout the study.

          9. Signed informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          3. Evidence of active infection (e.g., cellulitis, osteomyelitis).

          4. Subject having undergone surgical/endovascular revascularization or major/minor
             amputation, less than 1 month prior to screening.

          5. Planned or potential need for major/minor amputation or any revascularization of
             within 1 month of study entry upon investigator's judgment.

          6. Aorto-iliac stenosis or common femoral artery stenosis ≥70%, or otherwise inadequate

          8. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)/ stroke or acute myocardial infarction/unstable
             angina within 3 months prior to screening.

             IV).

         10. Uncontrolled severe hypertension.

         11. Diabetes mellitus with HbA1c &gt;10%.

         12. Current or history of proliferative retinopathy.

         13. Known Hepatitis B virus or Hepatitis C virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
             (AIDS) infections.

         14. Subjects with international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;2.5.

         15. Subject on renal replacement therapy or with Creatinine Clearance &lt;30 ml/min.

         16. Subject is currently enrolled in, or has not yet completed a period of at least 30
             days since ending another investigational device or drug trial(s).

         17. Known allergies to any of the following: DMSO, human serum albumin, bovine serum
             albumin.

         18. History of allergic/hypersensitivity reaction to any substance having required
             hospitalization and/or treatment with IV steroids/epinephrine.

         19. Pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen treatment on a daily basis.

         20. Active malignancy or history of malignancy within 5 years prior to study entry .

         21. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is unsuitable for participating in
             the study.

         22. Inability to understand and provide an informed consent.
