             progressed after treatment with standard therapies or for which there are no other
             appropriate therapies available. If nivolumab or pembrolizumab is an approved therapy
             for the participant's tumor type, but the participant has not been treated with it,
             the investigator may enroll the participant in this study.

        The selected tumor types are: non-small cell lung cancer, predominantly clear cell renal
        cell carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of
        the head and neck, or melanoma (excluding uveal melanoma)

             the sponsor.

        Note: In case of submitting unstained cut slides, freshly cut slides should be submitted
        to the testing laboratory within 14 days from when the slides are cut.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             treatment with one anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent is allowed

          -  Participants must have recovered adequately from any complications from major surgery
             prior to starting therapy.

          -  Participants having ≥2+ proteinuria on urinalysis will undergo 24-hour urine
             collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Participants with urine

             degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g., carotid artery)
             should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage associated
             with tumor shrinkage/necrosis following lenvatinib therapy.

          -  Active infection (any infection requiring systemic treatment)

          -  Participant is known to be positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis

             milligrams per day [mg/d] of prednisone or equivalent) may be approved after
             consultation with the sponsor.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine [T4], insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis, or has a history of interstitial lung disease

          -  Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by
             a positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG] or human chorionic gonadotropin
             [hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 International units per liter [IU/L] or
             equivalent units of β-hCG [or hCG]). A separate baseline assessment is required if a
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first
             dose of study drug.

          -  Females of childbearing potential who:

               -  do not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception for the entire
                  study period and for 120 days after study drug discontinuation, i.e.:

        For sites outside of the European Union (EU), it is permissible that if a highly effective
        method of contraception is not appropriate or acceptable to the participant, then the
        participant must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception, ie double
        barrier methods of contraception such as condom plus diaphragm or cervical/vault cap with
        spermicide.

        NOTES:

        All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
        postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
        group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically
        (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with
        surgery at least 1 month before dosing).

        Participants must be on a stable dose of the same oral hormonal contraceptive product for
        at least 4 weeks before dosing with study drug and for the duration of the study.

        - Male participants who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use a condom
        plus spermicide, and their female partners, if of childbearing potential, must use a
        highly effective method of contraception (see methods described in Exclusion Criterion
        #23) beginning at least 1 menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug(s), throughout the
        entire study period, and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug, unless the male
        participants are totally sexually abstinent or have undergone a successful vasectomy with
        confirmed azoospermia or unless the female partners have been sterilized surgically or are
        otherwise proven sterile.
