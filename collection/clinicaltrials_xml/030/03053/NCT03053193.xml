  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FLEX Registry will be implemented to operate as a large-scale, population based,
      prospective registry. All patients with stage I to III breast cancer who receive MammaPrint®
      and BluePrint testing on a primary breast tumor are eligible for entry into the FLEX
      Registry, which is intended to enable additional study arms at low incremental effort and
      cost. FLEX Registry will utilize an adaptive design, where additional targeted substudies
      and arms can be added after the initial study is opened.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FLEX Registry will include all patients with stage I-III breast cancer who have received
      MammaPrint and BluePrint testing in any clinical setting. Study arm appendices will specify
      treatment arm, inclusion criteria, and number of patients needed. Approximately 2000
      patients from 70-75 US based institutions will be enrolled.

      Treatment is at the discretion of the physician adhering to NCCN approved regimens of a
      recognized alternative.

      Clinical data will be collected and entered online at the time points listed: patient
      enrollment, time of treatment, 1 year post-treatment, and 2, 5, and 10 years post diagnosis.

      Objectives:

        -  Create a large scale, population-based registry of full genome expression data and
           clinical data to investigate new gene associations with prognostic and/or predictive
           value

        -  Utilize shared registry infrastructure to examine smaller groups of interest

        -  Generate hypotheses for targeted subset analyses and trials based on full genome data

        Study population will include patients with stage I to III breast cancer that have signed
        an informed consent, and are eligible to receive chemotherapy and endocrine therapy as
        defined by a good karnofsky index. Patients will be excluded if they have metastatic
        disease or do not have ample tissue to send to Agendia for testing.
