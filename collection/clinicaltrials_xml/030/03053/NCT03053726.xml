      In the VFS paradigm the stimulation frequency was set to alternate between high and low
      frequencies, where the frequency of stimulation or frequency combinations can be changed
      instantaneously according to damage of the moment rhythms. Variable frequency stimulation is
      a novel dynamic therapy which breaks through the existing single high-frequency stimulation
      paradigms. It is the world's first VFS therapy for the brain.

      In advanced stages of PD, motor symptoms and dyskinesia are effectively treated by deep
      brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) . Traditionally, in this
      procedure, stimulation is set to a constant frequency electrical stimulation with the
      physician programming the parameters of stimulation frequency, pulse width and amplitude,
      and stimulated patients' brain nuclei with single frequency, single pulse width and single
      amplitude of the electric stimulation. Indeed, high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the STN
      provides consistent, long-term improvement of the cardinal signs of PD . However, the
      treatment effects of HFS on the axial symptoms of PD, specifically FOG can be poor often
      causing further impairment. While this can be alleviated by using relatively low frequency
      stimulation (LFS) , major concerns in the clinical application of LFS exist in regards to
      its duration of therapeutic benefit. Previous studies have shown that LFS of the STN
      improves the axial motor signs in some PD patients, but a loss of therapeutic efficacy is
      seen in the short term. Thereafter, patients may present increased tremor, rigidity and
      bradykinesia, which is often intolerable outweighing the initial benefits of LFS therapy for
      FOG. As such, a suitable treatment strategy for FOG remains to be established.

      Based on previous findings on the relationships between stimulation frequency and movement
      rhythm regulation in the human body, The National Engineering Laboratory for
      Neuromodulation, Tsinghua University, proposes a method of variable frequency stimulation
      (VFS) for aiding movement.
