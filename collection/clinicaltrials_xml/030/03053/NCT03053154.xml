      The purpose of this study is to assess and determine the influence of pelvic inclination on
      sit to stand task in stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a crucial need to have a better understanding of effect of pelvic inclination on
      sit to stand activity and to know the important factors to be considered to improve the
      patients' treatment and performance. sixty participants are recruiting to assess the pelvic
      tilt angles in stroke patients during sitting position and to analyze the influence of
      pelvic tilt angles on ability to perform sit to stand task during rising from a chair in
      stroke patients.

    <measure>Total pelvic tilt</measure>
    <time_frame>One shot (Each participant is assessed immediately and it takes about 15 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Total pelvic tilt will be calculated as the difference between the anterior pelvic tilt and posterior pelvic tilt angles which measured by the palpation meter (PALM) inclinometer. It will be assessed as one shot in one assessment session.</description>
