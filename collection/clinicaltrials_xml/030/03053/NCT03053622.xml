  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to compare how much LY3074828, in two different formulations, is
      absorbed into the bloodstream and how long the body takes to get rid of it, when given as an
      injection under the skin or into the veins. Side effects of the injection will be collected.
      Each participant will be in the study for about 18 weeks, including screening.
