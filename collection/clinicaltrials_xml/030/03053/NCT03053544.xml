  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This internal pilot will be the first prospective study to assess the feasibility and
      efficacy of adding metformin in non‐diabetic rectal patients who undergo standard of care
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT). The translational aim of the study will inform on
      predictive factors (such as p53) and mechanism of action (hypoxia, proliferation). Metformin
      has been used for decades in patients with type 2 diabetes and has an extremely safe
      toxicity profile. With current interest in the use of metformin as a cancer therapeutic in
      non‐diabetics, this study is expected to provide proof‐of principle data for a larger study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II, single arm, controlled, open label internal pilot.

      The study hypothesis is that metformin improves rates of pathological complete response in
      patients with rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation by mitigating tumor
      proliferation and hypoxia. The hypothesis will be tested with this phase II trial, where
      metformin will be administered prior to, during and after CRT. The primary end‐point is the
      pCR rate. The study will also examine tumor proliferation and hypoxia longitudinally in
      tumor biopsies obtained at diagnosis as well as after metformin but prior to CRT. This study
      will, for the first time, provide proof‐of‐principle whether non‐diabetic patients with
      rectal cancer can benefit from metformin prior to, during and after CRT. These results may
      guide future trials across sites and provide biomarkers for future patient stratification
      and personalized radiation medicine.

      Study Schedule:

      Each participant will be consented prior to enrollment. At baseline, eligibility will be
      assessed based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once eligibility is confirmed and
      documented, participants are enrolled in the study. Eligible and consented participants are
      dispensed the study drug, metformin.

      Intervention Period

      Phase 1: (2 weeks prior to CRT)

      Participants will begin and self‐administer 500 mg of metformin twice daily by mouth for 2
      weeks prior to CRT. After 2 weeks of metformin administration and prior to CRT, an optional
      sigmoidoscopy will be performed for research purposes, if consented by the participant.

      Phase 2 (During CRT)

      Participants will continue metformin at a dose of 500 mg twice daily throughout the course
      of CRT. Participants will be followed weekly at usual SOC visits, which will include weekly
      blood tests to determine blood counts and liver and kidney function. Information about the
      occurrence of adverse events and updates in concomitant medications will be collected.

      Phase 3 (Post‐CRT)

      Participants will continue metformin at a dose of 500 mg twice daily, and complete the last
      dose the day prior to TME surgery.

      Follow-up

      Enrolled participants are to be followed approximately 1 month after surgery coinciding with
      the SOC visit. If an enrolled participant, for any reason, becomes ineligible for surgery
      the participant will be required to be seen for two follow‐up visits approximately 4 and 8
      weeks (+/‐ 1 week) after chemoradiation.

      End of Study Visit (3 Months)

      An end of study visit will be conducted 3 months after completion of surgical resection of
      the rectal tumor. Participants who become clinically ineligible for surgery will have an End
      of Study visit 3 months after completion of chemoradiation.

      Statistical analysis:

      The primary endpoint is the pCR rate. The pCR rate and its associated 95% confidence
      intervals will be estimated using unadjusted normal approximation for binomial proportions
      (z approximation). A responder will be defined as any participant who exhibits a complete
      response (total regression, no tumor cells, only fibrotic mass with or without mucin). pCR
      rate = sum of number of complete responders/number of participants qualified for efficacy
      analysis.

      The null hypothesis to be tested is that the pCR rate of all evaluable participants is ≤15%
      and the alternative hypothesis is the pCR rate is greater than or equal to 25%. A pCR of ≥
      25% would justify further evaluation of study therapy in phase III testing. The null
      hypothesis will be tested using a one‐sample binomial test of proportions.

      All participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with
      metformin, and all participants who have received at least one week of CRT and had surgery
      will be considered evaluable for response.

      Assessment of Tumor Proliferation and Hypoxia

      Proliferation, hypoxia and markers of metformin activity will be monitored longitudinally in
      the same participants using the diagnostic biopsy, a research biopsy taken at the start of
      CRT, and at time of surgery in cases without pCR. Markers will be quantified by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and include Ki67 (proliferation), CA9 (hypoxia), IRS‐P and S6‐P
      (metformin activity). A Colon Cancer Hypoxia Score (CCHS) from the expression of six genes
      was recently published and demonstrated to confer poor prognosis in stage II and III colon
      cancer patients. Hypoxia will also be assessed longitudinally by the CCHS score measured by
      qPCR. Furthermore, since previous study results suggest that p53 mutations exacerbates the
      anti‐proliferative effects of metformin, DNA will be isolated from the research biopsies and
      p53 DNA binding domain, in which 93% of mutations occur, will be sequenced.

      Sample Size considerations

      The study will be an internal pilot study. The initial goal is to complete the internal
      pilot study with the view to accrue 15 participants. Twelve participants have been shown to
      be the minimum number required to build a confidence interval. The sample of 15 will
      therefore be sufficient to construct a confidence interval and allow for the potential of
      drop outs. Upon completion of this internal pilot study, the data from the 15 participants
      will be used to derive a formal sample size calculation for a larger clinical trial. The
      data from these 15 individuals will also be incorporated into the final analysis for this
      larger trial, hence the choice of the 'internal' pilot design.
