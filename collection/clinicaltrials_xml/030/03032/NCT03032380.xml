        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects 18 years or older at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Subjects who have provided written informed consent or their informed consent has
             been provided by legal guardian

          -  Subjects who meet the clinical diagnosis criteria for hospital-acquired bacterial
             pneumonia (HABP),ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP), or
             healthcare-associated bacterial pneumonia (HCABP)

               1. HABP is defined as an acute bacterial pneumonia in a subject hospitalized for
                  more than 48 hours or developing within 7 days after discharge from a hospital.
                  Subjects may experience acute respiratory failure and require mechanical
                  ventilation for HABP (ventilated-HABP).

               2. VABP is defined as an acute bacterial pneumonia in a subject receiving
                  mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube for a minimum of 48 hours.

               3. HCABP is defined as an acute bacterial pneumonia in a subject who was
                  hospitalized in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within 90 days of the
                  infection; has been residing in a nursing home or long-term care facility;
                  received intravenous antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care or attended
                  a hospital clinic or hemodialysis clinic within the past 30 days of the current
                  infection.

          -  All subjects must fulfill at least 1 of the following clinical criteria at screening:

               1. New onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms or signs, such as cough, dyspnea,
                  tachypnea (eg, respiratory rate greater than 25 breaths/minute), expectorated
                  sputum production, or requirement for mechanical ventilation

               2. Hypoxemia (eg, a partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] less than 60 mm Hg while the
                  subject is breathing room air, as determined by arterial blood gas [ABG], or
                  worsening of the ratio of the PaO2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen
                  [PaO2/FiO2])

               3. Need for acute changes in the ventilator support system to enhance oxygenation,
                  as determined by worsening oxygenation (ABG or PaO2/FiO2) or needed changes in
                  the amount of positive end-expiratory pressure

               4. New onset of or increase in (quantity or characteristics) suctioned respiratory
                  secretions, demonstrating evidence of inflammation and absence of contamination

          -  All subjects must have at least 1 of the following signs:

               1. Documented fever (eg, core body temperature [tympanic, rectal, esophageal]
                  greater than or equal to 38°C [100.4°F])

               2. Hypothermia (eg, core body temperature [tympanic, rectal, esophageal] less than
                  or equal to 35°C [95.0°F])

               3. Leukocytosis with total peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count greater than or
                  equal to 10,000 cells/mm³

               4. Leukopenia with total peripheral WBC count less than or equal to 4500 cells/mm³

               5. Greater than 15% immature neutrophils (bands) noted on peripheral blood smear

          -  All subjects must have a chest radiograph during screening showing the presence of
             new or progressive infiltrate(s) suggestive of bacterial pneumonia. A computed
             tomography (CT) scan in the same time window showing the same findings could also be
             acceptable

          -  All subjects must have evidence of a Gram-negative bacterial infection involving the
             lower respiratory tract

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have a known or suspected community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP),
             atypical pneumonia, viral pneumonia, or chemical pneumonia (including aspiration of
             gastric contents, inhalation injury)

          -  Other exclusions based on the prescribing information of meropenem or linezolid,
             prior antibiotic usage, age, and pregnancy.
