  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patient with ILD have altered lung
      compliance on chest CT before they have macroscopic structural changes on CT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a group of lung disorders in which the lung tissues
      become inflamed and then damaged. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is one of the subtypes
      of ILD which has characteristic histological and CT features. It is well known that
      microscopic fibrosis occurs in the lungs of IPF patients well before the structural changes
      of fibrosis become apparent on CT. By combining sophisticated image analysis with CT scans
      obtained at full inspiration and full expiration, it may be possible to detect earlier
      changes of IPF than currently possible by looking at macro structural features alone. With
      the recent development of new therapeutics for IPF, early detection of the disease and
      improved monitoring of treatment efficacy will become important. Using CT to assess regional
      lung compliance has the potential to become an easily translated clinical tool.
