      Objectives: To determine LYC-001e's influences on ocular blood flow Ocular blood flow has
      been implicated as a parameter relevant to eye health and involved in the disease process of
      several ophthalmic pathologies including AMD, glaucoma, and diabetes we hypothesis that
      LYC-001e will increase measures of ocular blood flow in healthy individuals

      Methods: This is a single-phase, randomized, parallel, double blind , comparative study of
      LYC-001e versus placebo on ocular blood vessels in healthy individuals.
