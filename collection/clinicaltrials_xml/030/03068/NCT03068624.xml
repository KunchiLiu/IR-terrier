  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research study is divided into 2 parts: leukapheresis and treatment. In the
      leukapheresis part, white blood cells called T cells will be collected from participant to
      be made into specialized CD8+T cells. To make specialized CD8+T cells, researchers separate
      out T cells from blood and treat them so they are able to target melanoma cells. The blood
      cells are then given back to the participant in the treatment part of the study. This is
      known as &quot;adoptive T cell transfer&quot; or &quot;adoptive T cell therapy&quot;.

      This consent form is for the treatment part of the study.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving CD8+T cells
      with ipilimumab, cyclophosphamide, and IL-2 (aldesleukin) to participants with uveal
      melanoma that is metastatic (has spread). Researchers also want to learn if this combination
      can help to control the disease.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      assigned to a dose level of CD 8+ T cells based on when participant joins this study. Up to
      3 dose levels of CD 8+T cells will be tested. At least 3 participants will be enrolled at
      each dose level. After the first group receives a dose level of the CD 8+ T cells, another
      group will be enrolled at a higher or lower dose level based on any side effects that are
      seen. It is then possible that a third group will be enrolled at a higher or lower dose
      level than the second group.

      All participants will receive the same dose levels of all other drugs on this study.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Participant will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Day -2 (2 days
      before participant receives the CD8+ T cells). If the doctor thinks it is needed,
      participant will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.
      Participant may ask the study staff for information about how these drugs are given and
      their risks.

      On Day -1 participant will be admitted to the hospital and have a hepatic arterial catheter
      placed. This catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a blood vessel in
      participant's liver while participant is under local anesthesia. Participant's doctor will
      explain this procedure to participant in more detail, and participant will be required to
      sign a separate consent form. Participant will stay in the hospital overnight after the
      placement.

      On Day 0, participant will receive the CD8+ T cells through the catheter over 60 minutes.
      Participant will stay in the hospital overnight after the dose.

      Starting within 6 hours after the CD8+T cell infusion and then 2 times each day after that
      for 14 days, participant will receive aldesleukin as an injection into the skin around
      participant's abdomen. Participant will be taught how to give participant these injections.

      On Days 1, 22, 43, and 64, participant will receive ipilimumab by vein over about 90
      minutes.

      Study Visits:

      On Day -2:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw
           will include a pregnancy test if participant can become pregnant. To continue
           participation in this study, participant cannot be pregnant.

      On Days 0, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35, 43, 49, 56, 64, 70, 77, 84, 112, and 140:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body.

        -  Sometime between Days 35 and 42 and again between Days 77 and 84, participant will have
           a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      On Day 3, blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests,
      and tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed to check the status of the disease, blood (about 1½
      tablespoons) will be drawn every 3-6 months for up to 3 years.

      The study tests may be repeated or participant may have additional tests performed anytime
      the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Some of the study tests may be done at participant's local clinic if participant cannot
      return to MD Anderson. The study staff will discuss this with participant.

      Length of Treatment:

      The treatment portion of the study will last until Day 64. Participant will no longer be
      able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur,
      or if participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      At Day 168:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in participant's body.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months after Day 84, unless the disease gets worse or participant starts another
      cancer therapy, participant will have a CT scan or x-rays to check the status of the
      disease. Every 3 months for up to 5 years, the study staff will call participant or ask
      participant's doctor how participant is doing. If participant is called, the calls should
      last about 10-15 minutes.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will return to the clinic every 4-6 weeks or
      more often if the doctor thinks is needed. Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in
      participant's body.

      This is an investigational study. Specialized CD8+T cells are not FDA approved or
      commercially available. They are currently being used for research purposes only.
      Cyclophosphamide, ipilimumab, and aldesleukin are FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of uveal melanoma.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
