             conducted.

          4. Considered to be in stable health in the opinion of the investigator as determined
             by:

               1. A screening physical examination with no clinically significant abnormalities
                  unrelated to PG.

               2. Vital signs at screening: pulse rate ≥ 55 bpm, systolic blood pressure ≥ 90
                  mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 55 mmHg.

               3. Liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase,
                  bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase) &lt; 2x the upper limit of normal.

               4. All other pre-study clinical laboratory findings within normal range, or if
                  outside of the normal range are not deemed clinically significant in the opinion
                  of the investigator with exemption to leucopenia and lymphopenia - please refer
                  to exclusion criterion 24.

               5. No clinical abnormalities noted in the12-lead electrocardiogram in the opinion
                  of the investigator (Refer also to exclusion criterion 13).

               6. No evidence of macular edema in an ophthalmology evaluation (performed by an
                  ophthalmologist), supported with optical coherence tomography, where available
                  (dependent on site capability) at screening.

          5. Eligible male and female patients must agree not to participate in a conception
             process (i.e. active attempt to let female partner to become pregnant or to
             impregnate, sperm donation, oocyte donation, in vitro fertilization) for at least 30
             days after the last dose of study drug.

        Non-sterile patients who are sexually active must take adequate contraception measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically significant infection as judged by the investigator with an end date less
             than 6-weeks prior to treatment start (Day 1). In case of infection requiring
             hospitalization or intravenous antimicrobial therapy, or opportunistic infection,
             this infection must have ended at least 8 weeks prior to Day 1.

          2. Infection with hepatitis C virus anytime in the past; confirmed active infection with
             hepatitis B virus at screening.

          3. History of severe renal or severe hepatic impairment.

          4. Current active or latent tuberculosis (TB).

          5. A positive diagnostic TB test at screening.
