  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information and bone marrow, blood, saliva, cheek
      cells and skin to be used in the laboratory to assist the sponsor in identifying a new way
      of treating MDS.

      Goals of the study:

      The purpose of this study is to collect the blood and marrow samples, and non-involved
      fibroblasts, that are required to identify the unique, personalized array of mutation-driven
      neoantigens that are expressed by the subject's MDS cells and to assess the feasibility of
      immunizing and expanding one or more of the patient's T cells ex vivo for investigation of
      their use as adoptive cellular immunotherapy.

    <measure>Identification of patients' MDS-specific variant</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To select variants by comparing MDS versus non-MDS cell exome sequences. MDS-specific variant sequences are defined as those that differ between the two and are not common polymorphisms. We will also compare myeloid and lymphoid hematopoietic cells and assess the number of myeloid-specific vs myeloid and lymphoid MDS-related variants</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To select putative mutation-driven neoantigen-related peptides, which represent the sequences obtained from Aim 2, according to their ability to bind to the patient's MHC using PersImmune's licensed and proprietary algorithms.</description>
