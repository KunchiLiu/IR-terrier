        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects ≥ 18 years old (at the time of surgery) who have undergone
             Navio System-assisted UKR at least 2 years prior to enrollment. This includes UKR
             procedures with all Unicondylar Knee cemented implant designs.

          2. Subject had a primary diagnosis of unicompartmental, non-inflammatory degenerative
             joint disease including osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, or avascular necrosis,
             required correction of functional deformity, or required treatment of fractures that
             were unmanageable using other techniques.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject received the Navio System-assisted UKR on the index joint as a revision for a
             previously failed UKR.

          2. Subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, had advanced osteoarthritis or joint
             disease at the time of surgery and was better suited for Total Knee Arthroplasty
             (TKA).

          3. Subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, had a neuromuscular disorder that
             prohibited control of the index joint.

          4. Subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, was morbidly obese.

          5. Subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, was contraindicated for UKR.

          6. Subject (prospective subjects only), in the opinion of the Investigator, has an
             emotional or neurological condition including mental illness, mental retardation,
             drug or alcohol abuse.

          7. Subject (prospective subjects only) is a prisoner.
