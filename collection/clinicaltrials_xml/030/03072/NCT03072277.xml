  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DHANI-2 is an extension to DHANI (NCT01580345) which proposes to extend maternal
      supplementation (DHA or Placebo) from &lt;20 weeks of gestational age through 6 months
      postpartum and infant follow-up through 12 months. Leveraging the RCT design, DHANI-2 aims
      to assess the role of maternal DHA supplementation on infant neurodevelopment and body
      growth. It also intends to enhance the mechanistic understanding by the addition of repeated
      biochemical measures from mother-child dyads.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial would be conducted among pregnant
      women in India to test the effectiveness of supplementing pregnant Indian women with 400
      mg/d algal DHA compared to placebo from mid-pregnancy through delivery. Eligible
      participants would be randomized to receive either 400 mg of DHA or a placebo baseline
      measures would be taken before the enrollment of the participant in the study. The
      mother-child dyads would be followed through infant age 1 year and anthropometric
      measurements and biochemical investigations would be used to assess the effect of maternal
      DHA supplementation on infant neurodevelopment at ages 6- and 12-months using validated the
      Development Assessment Scale for Indian Infants (DASII).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 to 35 year old pregnant women (singleton) at &lt;=20 weeks of gestation (calculated
             from the LMP by study physician).

          -  Willing to participate in the study and perform all measurements for self, husband
             and the offspring including anthropometry, dietary assessment, questionnaires and
             biological samples (blood and breast milk).

          -  Willing to provide signed and dated informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women allergic (if aware) to any of the test products.

          -  Women at high risk for hemorrhagic bleeding, clotting (if aware).

          -  Women with high-risk pregnancies (history and prevalence of pregnancy complications,
             including abruptio placentae, preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, any
             serious bleeding episode in the current pregnancy, and/ or physician referral);
             and/or diagnosed chronic degenerative disease(s) such as diagnosed heart disease,
             cancer, stroke or diabetes (as omega-3 could raise blood sugar and lower insulin
             production).

          -  Women consuming omega-3 supplements or having used these in 3 months preceding the
             intervention period.

          -  Reported participation in another biomedical trial 3 months before the start of the
             study or during the study (not to get the results of the present study contaminated).
