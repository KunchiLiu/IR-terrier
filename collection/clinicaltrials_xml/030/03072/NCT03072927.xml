    <textblock>
      This prospective longitudinal study will compare incidence rates of Medicare beneficiary
      surgical and minimally invasive intervention post index procedure, as well as harms
      associated with the MILD procedure, at 24 months post-treatment with MILD, tested against a
      control group of similar patients that have had a comparable procedure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) Medicare Research Identifiable Files
      (RIFs) containing all medical claims for 100% of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the
      Medicare fee-for-service program, claims-based patient history and demographics will be
      combined with longitudinal analyses. In this study, the control group will include all
      patients receiving interspinous process decompression (IPD) for the treatment of lumbar
      spinal stenosis (LSS) with neurogenic claudication (NC). The treatment group will include
      all patients receiving MILD during the enrollment period. The date of the MILD and IPD
      procedure will serve as the index procedure date for 24-month follow-up. This study is
      exempt from IRB oversight (Department of Health and Human Services regulations 45 CFR 46).
