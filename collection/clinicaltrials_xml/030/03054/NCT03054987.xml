      The purpose of this study is to compare the need to use mechanical lithotripsy between
      patients undergoing POC-LL and EBS for removal of difficult bile duct stones

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gallstones can cause pain, jaundice or pancreatitis by blocking the bile duct. Bile duct
      stones should be removed during an endoscopic procedure called endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using basket or balloons. However, large stones (more than
      15mm in size) or multiple stones can be difficult to remove during ERCP with routine
      techniques. In such cases, we have to break up the stone into small pieces before it can be
      removed safely. We call this mechanical lithotripsy. Mechanical lithotripsy can be done by
      the use of a basket and a sheath that can be wrapped around the stone, which are in turn
      attached to a handle that is turned to result in stone breakage. But, this technique is
      difficult to perform. Other easier standard-of-care techniques used to remove difficult bile
      duct stones during an ERCP are peroral cholangioscopy-directed laser lithotripsy (POC-LL)
      and endoscopic balloon sphincterotomy (EBS). The POC-LL technique helps us to directly see
      the bile duct stone. Using this technique a catheter is inserted into the endoscope and into
      the bile duct to reach the stone. Using this catheter, the energy from laser (laser
      lithotripsy) can be accurately focused onto the stone to cause stone break-up. After the
      stone is broken to small pieces it can be removed by usual methods such as use of a balloon
      or a basket. EBS is a technique in which an 8 to 20mm balloon is used to enlarge (dilation)
      the opening of the bile duct. Following dilation, the stone is removed using routine
      methods. It is at the discretion of the treating physician on which technique he will use to
      remove the bile duct stone. The purpose of this study is to compare the need to use
      mechanical lithotripsy between patients undergoing POC-LL and EBS for removal of difficult
      bile duct stones
