    <description>Each patient will attend rehabilitation program for three days per week for six weeks. Patients will receive balance training in addition to supervised rehabilitation program which is including patient education, hot pack, stretching, strengthening and postural exercise.
Patients will also implement home exercise program. Balance training will be non-supervised program.</description>

    <description>Firstly, we will use heat pack as a modality to affected shoulder. Then, stretching will be applied as hold-relax technique in PNF for shoulder flexion, abduction, internal and external rotations. Isotonic exercise will be done with elastic bands for strengthening.
Home exercises will include postural exercise, stretching and strengthening. Balance exercise will receive as non-supervised program.</description>
