  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants will have PAD. PAD will be defined as follows. First, an ankle brachial
        index (ABI) &lt;0.90 at the baseline study visit is an inclusion criterion for PAD. Second,
        potential participants who have an ABI &gt; 0.90 but â‰¤ 1.00 and experience a 20% or higher
        drop in ABI after heel-rise exercise will be eligible. Third, potential participants with
        an ABI &gt; 0.90 who have vascular lab evidence of PAD or angiographic evidence of PAD who
        have ischemic symptoms during the six-minute walk and/or treadmill exercise stress test
        will be eligible. Fourth, potential participants with a history of lower extremity
        revascularization who do not meet the criterion above and have an ABI &gt; 0.90 with a 20% or
        higher drop in ABI after heel-rise exercise will be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Above- or below-knee amputation.

          2. Critical limb ischemia.

          3. Wheelchair-bound or requiring a walker to ambulate.

          4. Walking is limited by a symptom other than PAD.

          5. Current foot ulcer on bottom of foot.

          6. Diabetes mellitus defined as one or more of a) patient report of physician diagnosed
             diabetes mellitus, b) use of one or more diabetes medications, c) baseline
             hemoglobinA1C value of &gt;6.5, d) two fasting glucose values &gt;126 mg/dl. [NOTE: the
             second fasting glucose value will be at the discretion of the principal investigator.
             For example, if the first value is &gt;300, then investigators may decide not to repeat
             the value.]

          7. Chronic kidney disease defined as GFR &lt;45. [NOTE: if GFR is 40-44, investigator
             discretion will be used to determine if a repeat test may be performed. If the second
             GFR value is &gt;45, the participant may be included.]

          8. Chronic liver disease defined as two or more hepatic function tests &gt;2.0 times the
             upper limit of normal. [NOTE: participants who meet this criterion may undergo a
             re-test of hepatic function tests to determine whether initially elevated hepatic
             enzymes represented a transient or spurious phenomenon.]

          9. Failure to successfully complete the 2-week study run-in, defined as unable to
             tolerate metformin and/or failing to take the medication daily for 10 or more days in
             the two-week period.

         10. Planned lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, or other major surgery
             during the next six months.

         11. Lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, cardiovascular event, coronary
             revascularization, or other major surgery in the previous three months.

         12. Major medical illness including renal disease requiring dialysis, lung disease
             requiring oxygen, Parkinson's disease, a life-threatening illness with life
             expectancy less than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two
             years. [NOTE: potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for
             an early stage cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent.
             Participants who only use oxygen at night may still qualify.]

         13. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score &lt;23 or dementia.

         14. Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months.
             [NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will
             become eligible after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or gene
             therapy study so long as at least six months have passed since the final intervention
             administration. After completing a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem cell
             or gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study follow-up visit
             as long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the
             trial.]

         15. Currently taking metformin or has taken metformin in past six months.

         16. Increase in angina or angina at rest

         17. Non-English speaking.

         18. Visual impairment that limits walking ability.

         19. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.

        Vulnerable populations (fetuses, pregnant women, children, prisoners, and
        institutionalized persons) and adults unable to consent will not be included in the study.
