      To collect data on actual-use to assess technical performance and user injections of
      dupilumab auto-injection device by patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).

    <textblock>
      Study is conducted in 2 parts; part A and part B.

      Part A - Patients with moderate-to-severe AD will be randomized to receive dupilumab (dose
      1) by auto-injector (AI) device or prefilled syringe.

      Once part A is complete, part B will randomize patients with moderate-to-severe AD to
      receive dupilumab (dose 2) by auto-injector (AI) device or prefilled syringe.
