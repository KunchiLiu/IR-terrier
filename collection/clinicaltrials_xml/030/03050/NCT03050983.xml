    <textblock>
      Single site prospective observational nested study of bedside CS20p monitor on the GCF
      impeded into a retrospective review of the frequency of escalation of care with intermittent
      vitals signs compared to continuous respiratory monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single site observational study of alarms and workflow on the general care floor where
      continuous surveillance monitoring (SM) with capnography and pulse oximetry is the standard
      of care before and after the Integrated Pulmonary Index is enabled within the context of a
      historical review of frequency of escalation of care as a function of the frequency and
      method of monitoring respiratory status. Observation of alarms will be electronically
      recorded on an iPad that will have a virtual view of the CS20p measurements and alarm alerts
      for 24 hours on several patients at the same time. Patients will only be enrolled for 24
      hours of observation of alarm status with associated patient activity and clinical
      interventions. Observation data with IPI disabled prior to implementation of IPI/IPI alarms
      will be used to evaluate optimal alarm alert settings including an IPI alert when enabled.
      Observation will continue with IPI enabled and alarms adjusted to study clinical utility of
      IPI on the GCF.

        The target study population will be adult patients on the general care floors (GCF) units
        where the dual parameter CS20p monitor is installed and used according to the Vanderbilt
        University Medical Center (VUMC) standard of care. Only those patients monitored via the
        CS20p with both capnography and pulse oximetry (dual parameters) for standard of care may
        be enrolled for observation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Spontaneous breathing adults â‰¥ 18 years of age, both male and female

          2. On dual parameter CS20p monitoring with both capnography and pulse oximetry per
             Vanderbilt standard of care to monitor patients for respiratory compromise.

          3. Expected minimum duration of 24 hours of continued capnography and pulse oximetry
             monitoring.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Those patients who are expected to be discharged within six hours on the randomly
             selected observation floor.

          2. Those patients not on the randomly selected floor for observation.

          3. Those subjects randomly removed from the selected floor for observation pool in order
             to limit the number of subjects to be observed.

          4. Those subjects in rooms with limited Wi-Fi signal quality as per VUMC IT.
