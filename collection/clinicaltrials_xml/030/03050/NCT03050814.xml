      Background:

      Colorectal cancer is a common cancer in the U.S. It causes the second most cancer-related
      deaths. The drug avelumab and vaccine Ad-CEA together help the immune system fight cancer.

      Objective:

      To test if avelumab and Ad-CEA plus standard therapy treats colorectal cancer that has
      spread to other sites better than standard therapy alone.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with untreated colorectal cancer that has spread in the body

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Test to see if their cancer has a certain deficiency

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Scans

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Tumor sample. This can be from a previous procedure.

      A small group of participants will get Ad-CEA and avelumab plus standard therapy. This is
      FOLFOX plus bevacizumab for up to 24 weeks then capecitabine plus bevacizumab.

      The others will have treatment in 2-week cycles. They will be Arm A or B:

      Arm A: FOLFOX and bevacizumab by IV days 1 and 2 for 12 cycles. After that, capecitabine by
      mouth twice a day and bevacizumab by IV on day 1.

      Arm B: Ad-CEA injection every 2 12 weeks. Avelumab by IV on day 1 of each cycle. FOLFOX and
      bevacizumab by IV days 2 and 3 for 12 cycles. Then, capecitabine by mouth twice a day and
      bevacizumab through IV on day 2.

      Participants will repeat screening tests during the study.

      Participants will be treated until their disease gets worse or they have bad side effects.
      Arm A participants can join Arm B. They will have a visit 4 5 weeks after they stop therapy.

      Background

        -  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer diagnosis in the United States
           and accounts for the second most cancer-related deaths.

        -  Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a transmembrane protein that was first identified
           for its role in the maintenance of self-tolerance and prevention of autoimmunity.
           Blockade of the interaction between PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells is
           expected to reverse T cell suppression within tumors. These agents are dependent on
           underlying T cell activation against the tumor cell to be effective.

        -  Avelumab is a fully human IgG1 anti-PDL1 antibody that selectively binds to PD-L1 and
           competitively blocks its interaction with PD-1.

        -  In ongoing phase 1 trials of avelumab, the agent has been well tolerated and has shown
           clinical activity. Clinical trials with anti-PD-1/L1 agents in colorectal cancer have
           resulted in minimal activity in patients who do not have mismatch repair deficiency
           (MMR-D)

        -  Therapeutic cancer vaccines targeting overexpressed proteins offer a potential method
           to activate T cells against tumors.

        -  A novel adenovirus based, CEA-targeting vaccine has demonstrated cytolytic T cell
           responses in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Standard of care agents in first line metastatic CRC have properties been associated
           with improved immune response via immunologic cell death and immunogenic modulation.

      Objectives

      -To determine if there is an improvement progression free survival among patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer lacking a mismatch repair deficiency who are treated with
      standard of care + anti- PDL1 monoclonal antibody + Ad-CEA therapeutic cancer vaccine
      compared with standard of care alone.

      Eligibility

        -  Subjects age 18 and older with previously untreated pathologically confirmed metastatic
           colorectal cancer; prior adjuvant therapy is acceptable

        -  ECOG performance status &lt; 1

        -  Normal organ and bone marrow function

        -  Subjects with active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment and subjects requiring
           system steroids (except for physiologic doses for steroid replacement) are not allowed

        -  Tumor tissue (block) sample and whole blood sample must be available for proteomics,
           genomics and transcriptomics analyses. Archival FFPE tumor tissue block (&lt; 24 weeks
           prior to coming on study) with a minimum tissue surface area of 25 mm2, 75 micro meters
           thick, and at least 30% malignant tissue must be available; leftover material from
           fresh biopsy if collected for diagnosis at screening may also be utilized.

        -  Subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-D or
           MSI-High) will

      not be eligible

      Design

        -  This is a randomized, multicenter phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the
           potential improvement in progression free survival (PFS) when Avelumab and Ad-CEA
           vaccine are used in combination with standard of care therapy in metastatic colorectal
           cancer when compared with standard of care alone (FOLFOX-B).

        -  A lead in cohort, comprising the first 6 evaluable subjects enrolled, will be treated
           with avelumab + Ad- CEA vaccine + standard of care in order to assess the safety of the
           combination.

        -  If no more than 1 subject in the lead in cohort experiences a dose limiting toxicity
           attributable to the IND agents, 70 evaluable subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis
           to receive either Avelumab + Ad-CEA vaccine + standard of care (Arm B) or standard of
           care alone (Arm A).

        -  Standard of care therapy consists of 6 12 two week cycles of bevacizumab + FOLFOX
           (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) followed by two week cycles of bevacizumab +
           capecitabine until disease progression.

        -  Subjects assigned Arm A that have progressive disease will be offered Avelumab + Ad-CEA
           vaccine in combination with a standard chemotherapy regimen.

        -  Kaplan-Meier curves and a two-tailed log-rank test will be the primary analysis
           methods.

        -  The accrual ceiling for the study is set at 81.

             contraindications to treatment with the standard of care regimen as determined by the
             investigator. Prior adjuvant therapy is acceptable (including immunotherapy), but
             must have been completed at least 6 months prior to metastatic disease diagnosis.

          -  Patients should not be eligible for potentially curative surgical intervention in the
             case of oligometastic disease at the time of enrollment or must have actively refused
             after explicit discussion of potential benefit of this intervention with
             multidisciplinary team.

          -  Metastatic disease must be histologically confirmed by tumor sample with pathologic
             diagnosis confirmed at the enrolling institution. Tumor block of FFPE tumor tissue
             attained within the prior 6 months with no treatment between sample and enrollment
             must be available; otherwise, a fresh tumor biopsy will be collected.

          -  Tumor tissue (block) sample and whole blood sample must be available for proteomics,
             genomics and transcriptomics analyses. Archival FFPE tumor tissue block (&lt;24 weeks

             micrometers thick,

        and at least 30% malignant tissue must be available; leftover sample from a fresh tumor

        biopsy collected for diagnostic/clinical purposes at screening may also be utilized to be

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria.

          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years. Because safety data is not known with this
             agent in patients less than 18 years old, children are excluded from this study.

          -  The effects of Ad-CEA vaccine and Avelumab on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             For this reason and because Ad-CEA vaccine and Avelumab as well as other therapeutic
             agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing
