      lansoprazole in the treatment of participants with duodenal ulcer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-438. TAK-438 is being tested to treat
      people who have duodenal ulcers and also may or may not have Helicobacter pylori (HP)
      infection. This study will look at duodenal ulcer healing and also the elimination of HP in
      people who take TAK-438 versus lansoprazole. The study will enroll approximately 770
      patients.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two
      treatment groupsâ€”which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during
      the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-438 20 mg

        -  Lansoprazole 30 mg

      HP+ participants will be asked to take a TAK- 438 tablet and a lansoprazole capsule twice
      daily in conjunction with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for 2 weeks, followed up by a
      TAK-438 tablet and a lansoprazole capsule once daily for up to 6 weeks. HP negative (HP-)
      participants will be asked to take a TAK-438 tablet and a lansoprazole capsule once daily
      for up to 6 weeks.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted China, Korea, Taiwan and Philippines. The overall
      time to participate in this study is up to 10 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits
      plus final visit at 2 weeks or 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Has endoscopic evidence of active duodenal ulcer(s) (i.e., mucosal defects with white
        coating [including cases associated with blood coagulation as long as there is no active
        bleeding]) measuring 5 mm or larger in longest diameter within 14 days prior to
        randomization.

               2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or total
                  bilirubin levels: &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN).

         17. Has hypersensitivity to TAK-438, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), bismuth,
             clarithromycin, or amoxicillin. Skin testing may be performed according to local
