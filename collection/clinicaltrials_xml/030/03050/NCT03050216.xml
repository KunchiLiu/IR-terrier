    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional Simon's optimal two-stage phase II trial of CD3/CD19 depleted,
      ALT-803 activated, haploidentical donor NK cells and subcutaneous ALT-803 given after

    <description>Preparative Regimen:
Fludarabine 25 mg/m2 x 5 days start day -6 Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg x 2 days on day -5 and -4
ALT-803 Stimulated Donor NK Cells:
The apheresis product (collected day -1) will be enriched for NK cells with the large-scale CliniMacs® device (Miltenyi) by depletion of CD3+ cells to remove T-lymphocytes and depletion of CD19+ cells to remove B-lymphocytes. The NK cell enriched product will be stimulated by overnight incubation with 36.1 ng/mL ALT-803 under GMP conditions and infused on day 0.
ALT-803 to Facilitate NK Cell Survival and Expansion:
ALT-803 at 10 mcg/kg subcutaneously (SC) with the 1st dose administered on day 0 (no sooner than 4 hours post NK cells), day +5 and day +10 for 3 doses total</description>
