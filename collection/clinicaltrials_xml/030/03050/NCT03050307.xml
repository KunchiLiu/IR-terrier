      lansoprazole in the treatment of participants with gastric ulcer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-438. TAK-438 is being tested to treat
      people who have stomach ulcers and also may or may not have Helicobacter pylori (HP)
      infection. This study will look at stomach ulcer healing and also the elimination of HP in
      people who take TAK-438 versus lansoprazole.

      The study will enroll approximately 830 patients.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two
      treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the participants and study doctor during
      the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-438 20 mg

        -  Lansoprazole 30 mg

      Study treatment will depend upon the Helicobacter pylori infection status of the
      participant, and include bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for the first 2 weeks in H
      pylori infected (HP+) participants. HP+ participants will be asked to take a TAK- 438 tablet
      or a lansoprazole capsule twice daily in conjunction with bismuth-containing quadruple
      therapy for 2 weeks, followed up by a TAK-438 tablet or a lansoprazole capsule once daily
      for up to 6 weeks. HP- participants will be asked to take a TAK-438 tablet or a lansoprazole
      capsule once daily for up to 8 weeks.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China, Korea, Taiwan and Philippines. The
      overall time to participate in this study is up to 16 weeks. Participants will make multiple
      visits plus final visit at 2 weeks or 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Has endoscopic evidence of active gastric ulcer(s) (i.e. mucosal defects with white
        coating [including cases associated with blood coagula as long as there is no active

               2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or total
                  bilirubin levels: &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN).

         17. Has hypersensitivity to TAK-438, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), bismuth,
             clarithromycin, or amoxicillin. Skin testing may be performed according to local
