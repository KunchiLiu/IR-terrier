  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients' temperatures after using one of two
      ventilator circuits (breathing systems): the ANAPOD™ Heat and Humidification System (ANAPOD™
      system) or the standard ventilator circuit with a heat-moisture exchanger (standard
      ventilator). The ANAPOD™ system will provide additional heat and humidity to patients
      through their breathing tube while the standard ventilator will not. The investigators are
      doing this research study to find out if the ventilator circuit providing additional heat
      and humidity will keep patients warmer during surgery and after surgery.

    <masking_description>Patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group prior to surgery. Group randomization was performed using a randomization schedule prepared by the Division of Clinical Statistics with patients randomized in blocks of four. For consented and enrolled patients on the day of surgery in the admit areas, a participant was assigned the next sequential participant ID number and the appropriate sealed envelope was opened to reveal the participant's randomized intervention. This occurred before the patient was transferred to the operating suite. Individuals who performed data analysis were blinded to treatment group.</masking_description>

    <description>Core body temperature will be taken in the esophagus. The last recorded esophageal temperature will be used for surgeries not reaching 3 hours duration.</description>

    <measure>Shivering</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 hours after completion of the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Shivering in the post-anesthesia care unit will be assessed using the Bedside Shivering Assessment Scale. This is a 4 point scale and rate shivering as the following: absent, mild, moderate, or severe.</description>
