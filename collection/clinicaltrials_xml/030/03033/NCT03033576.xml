    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II studies how well ipilimumab with or without nivolumab work in
      treating patients with melanoma that is stage IV or stage II and cannot be removed by
      surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced melanoma refractory
      to an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent, treated with combination therapy ipilimumab plus
      nivolumab versus ipilimumab alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate difference in T-cell infiltrate between on-study biopsy samples of patients
      who respond to combination therapy (including confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and
      partial response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) as compared
      to those who do not respond.

      II. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), defined as confirmed complete or partial
      response per RECIST 1.1, in each treatment arm.

      III. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of patients in each treatment arm. IV. To
      evaluate the toxicity profile of patients in each treatment arm.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the marginal prognostic value of baseline T-cell density, T-cell receptor (TCR)
      clonality, and mutational load in terms of response.

      II. To assess the joint prognostic value of T-cell density, TCR clonality, and mutational
      load in terms of response.

      III. To identify T-cell poor subtype(s) that are associated with response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on
      days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 1 year.

    <time_frame>From date of registration to date of first documentation of progression or symptomatic deterioration, or death due to any cause, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CD8+ expression levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>will evaluate by comparing the quantitative CD8+ expression levels between patients who eventually respond and patients who do not respond using a two-sample t-test and control the type I error at the two-sided 0.05 level. Assuming that the trial accrues to completion, 90% compliance in tissue and biopsy submission, and that 25% of patients respond, then we anticipate 80% power to detect a mean difference in CD8+ expression of 0.875 standard deviations.</description>

    <description>Toxicity will be assessed in each arm separately. Any toxicity with at least 5% chance of occurring has 93.7% and 60.3% chance of being observed at least once in the combination therapy and ipilimumab alone arms, respectively. We will be able to estimate the rate of occurrence of any particular toxicity to within 12.3% (95% CI) and 21.4% in the combination therapy and ipilimumab alone arms, respectively</description>

    <measure>OS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will construct Kaplan-Meier plots and estimate the median OS and construct 95% Brookmeyer-Crowley confidence intervals. We will be able to estimate the ORR or the OS rates at a particular time point (e.g. 13 weeks) to within 12.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]) and 21.4% in the combination therapy and ipilimumab alone arms, respectively. Waterfall plots will be constructed to represent each patient's best change in tumor burden.</description>

    <description>Will estimate the response rate in each arm and construct 95% binomial confidence intervals. All randomized patients will be included in the analysis of response. Patients who cannot have their exact response determined due to inadequate disease assessments will be counted in the denominator as non-responders.</description>
