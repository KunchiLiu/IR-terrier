  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, parallel-arm, non-randomized study is designed to evaluate
      safety and tolerability of higher infusion parameters of IgPro20 in subjects with primary
      immunodeficiency (PID). A total of 45 subjects (including at least 14 [30%] pediatric
      subjects ≤ 17 years of age and at least 9 [20%] obese subjects with body mass index [BMI] of
      ≥30 kg/m2) with confirmed PID will be evaluated in the study. The study will include three
      cohorts of 15 subjects each as follows: i) Pump-Assisted Volume Cohort (weekly infusions),
      volume per injection site of 25 mL up to 50 mL, ii) Pump Assisted Flow Rate Cohort (weekly
      infusions), flow rate per injection site of 25 mL/hour up to 100 mL/hour, iii) Manual Push
      Flow Rate Cohort (5 to 7 infusions per week), flow rate per injection site of 25 to 30
      mL/hour up to 120 mL/hour (equivalent of approximately 0.5 mL/minute up to 2 mL/minute).
      Each cohort will test 3 infusion parameter levels (4 for the pump-assisted flow rate
      cohort), repeated at least 4 times over a duration of 12 weeks (16 weeks for the flow rate
      cohort). After the fourth infusion of each level, subjects may switch to the next infusion
      parameter level (eg, from 25 to 50 mL/h). During the study, the weekly dose will remain
      unchanged (as prescribed by treating physician, usually within 100-200 mg/kg per week
      range); only the respective infusion parameter under evaluation will change.

    <description>If a subject within the Pump-Assisted Cohorts is able to perform at least 3 out of 4 valid infusions at a certain infusion parameter level (weekly volumes per injection site of 25 mL up to 50 mL; weekly flow rates per injection site of 25 mL/hour up to 100 mL/hour), he/she will be considered to be a responder for this infusion parameter level. If a subject within the Manual Push Cohort is able to perform at least 15 valid infusions during 4 weeks at a certain flow rate level [daily (ie, 5 to 7 times per week) flow rates per injection site of 25 to 30 mL/hour up to 120 mL/hour (equivalent of approximately 0.5 mL/minute up to 2 mL/minute)], he/she will be considered to be a responder. An infusion parameter will be considered successfully achieved if at least one third of the subjects in the corresponding cohort are responders at that infusion parameter level.</description>
