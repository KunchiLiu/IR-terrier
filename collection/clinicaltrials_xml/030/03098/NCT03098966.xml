      This is a retrospective study that was performed at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital.

      The following data will be gathered (whenever available), tabulated and subjected to the
      proper statistical analysis:

      History:

        -  Age

        -  Duration of marriage

        -  Inter-pregnancy interval

        -  Gestational age (by menstrual dates or US)

        -  Obstetric history (parity, mode of delivery, assisted vaginal delivery, previous
           vaginal birth after cesarean section, neonatal outcome)

        -  Present and past history of any medical, surgical or obstetric problems; history of
           infection after previous CS

      General examination:

        -  General condition

        -  Vital data

      Abdominal examination:

        -  Fundal level

        -  Estimated fetal weight (clinically or by US)

        -  Scar tenderness

      Vaginal examination on admission:

        -  Cervical status

        -  Station of presenting part

        -  Membranes status

        -  Pelvic adequacy

      Investigations performed:

        -  Complete Blood Count

        -  Ultrasonography

      Intrapartum management:

        -  Progress and duration of labor according to partogram (or admission-delivery time)

        -  Intrapartum complications; placental abruption, uterine rupture, hysterectomy,
           complications during surgical intervention if any

      Mode of delivery:

        -  Vaginal delivery (spontaneous, assisted, complications)

        -  Cesarean section (indication, scar dehiscence)

      Postpartum Data:

        -  Postpartum hemorrhage

        -  Blood transfusion

        -  Neonatal outcome; fetal weight, birth trauma, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission,
           mortality
