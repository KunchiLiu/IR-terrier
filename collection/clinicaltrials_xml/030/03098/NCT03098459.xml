  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive skills are essential to live independently, manage finances, maintain employment,
      and function in society. Loss of these cognitive skills puts a tremendous burden on society
      as seen with dementias, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury. The INSIGHT-ICU
      Study (Illuminating Neuropsychological dysfunction and Systemic Inflammatory mechanisms
      Gleaned after Hospitalization in Trauma-ICU Study) is the first comprehensive and
      longitudinal long-term cognitive impairment study after traumatic injury. The societal
      impact of long-term cognitive impairment after trauma is immense given that these patients
      are young and constitute a large proportion of employable adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive skills are the crucial abilities required to manage money, maintain employment,
      and live independently. Long-term cognitive impairment (LTCI) is a disabling loss of these
      skills that can persist for months to years. LTCI frequently occurs after primary brain
      injury (e.g., traumatic brain injury, hypoxia), but older LTCI research has not
      characterized primary brain injury using NIH Common Data Elements in Imaging, the
      contributions of polytrauma, and the time-course of the critical illness, including
      secondary brain injury (i.e., delirium). In our recent large study of ICU patients without
      primary brain injury, over 50% of patients had LTCI and nearly 50% were newly unemployed at
      one-year post-discharge. In-hospital delirium was the major independent risk factor for
      LTCI. Surprisingly, this delirium-related LTCI was similar to the LTCI seen in past studies
      after moderate traumatic brain injury. Thus, both primary and secondary brain injury are
      associated with LTCI, yet they have not been studied together. There is an unmet need to
      define the independent risks of primary brain injury and delirium in LTCI. The trauma ICU
      patient is at combined risk for primary brain and/or multisystem injuries, secondary brain
      injury, and critical illness; these critically injured patients are the unique population to
      address this knowledge gap.

      Therefore, our FIRST HYPOTHESIS is that delirium duration is an independent risk for the
      severity of LTCI, controlling for confounders of co-morbidities, socioeconomic status,
      pre-injury employment, primary brain injury, polytrauma, and critical illness. AIM 1 will
      address this hypothesis by defining the independent risks of primary and secondary brain
      injury on the severity of LTCI among 900 trauma ICU subjects.

      But, LTCI's real-world impact on employment has not been explained or adjusted for the above
      confounders and social factors. Accordingly, our SECOND HYPOTHESIS is that LTCI severity is
      an independent risk for lower level of employment, adjusting for similar confounders. AIM 2
      will delineate the independent risk of LTCI severity on employment among trauma ICU
      survivors. Lastly, LTCI pathogenesis may be related to persistent inflammation.

      So, our THIRD HYPOTHESIS is that hospital discharge biomarkers of persistent inflammation
      will be independent risks for LTCI severity, adjusting for similar confounders. AIM 3 will
      explore the mechanistic role of plasma inflammatory biomarkers on LTCI severity among trauma
      ICU survivors.
