          4. Fatigue measured by FACIT-F ≤30.

          5. On a stable regimen of IR prednisone (5 to 15 mg/day) for a period of at least 30
             days prior to Screening, expected to remain stable for the next 6 months.

          6. On a stable SLE treatment regimen for a period of at least 30 days prior to
             Screening, and expected to remain stable for the next 6 months. Any of the following
             medications are permitted if stable for at least 30 days prior to Screening and

                  mycophenylate mofetil at no more than 2 grams/day), belimumab, cyclophosphamide,
                  calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. tacrolimus, cyclosporine)

          7. Entry of daily ePRO data on 11 of 14 days during the baseline period, and completion
             of at least 6 out of the 8 weekly ePRO questionnaires during the baseline period

          8. Willing and able to perform and comply with all study procedures, including taking
             pills daily as prescribed, completing the ePROs on the smart phone, wearing the smart
             watch day and night, bringing the smartphone on all activities away from home (e.g.,
             walks, errands, visiting, shopping, traveling), keeping the smartphone and smartwatch
             charged daily, carefully using the smartphone and smartwatch as clinical tools and
             keeping them secure from others, and attending monthly clinic visits as scheduled

          9. Females of childbearing potential must be currently using a highly effective method
             of contraception that may include, but is not limited to, abstinence, sex only with
             persons of the same sex, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner,
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, licensed hormonal methods, intrauterine
             device, or use of a spermicide combined with a barrier method (e.g., condom,
             diaphragm) for 30 days before and 90 days after receiving the study drug

             following that are allowed:

               -  Activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt; &gt;2.5× ULN due to lupus

                  related to alcoholic liver disease, uncontrolled diabetes, or viral hepatitis.
                  If present, any abnormalities in the ALT and/or AST must be ≤5× ULN

          8. Pregnant or nursing, or females not using effective contraception

             not caused by SLE (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic,
             gastrointestinal, neurological, or infectious) which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could confound the results of the study or put the subject at undue
             risk
