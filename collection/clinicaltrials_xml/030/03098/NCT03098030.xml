  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, multicenter, open-label, randomized study of dinutuximab and irinotecan
      versus irinotecan alone in subjects with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer
      (SCLC). Part 1 of the study involves intrasubject dose escalation to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of dinutuximab in combination with irinotecan. Part 2 of the study is designed
      to determine whether dinutuximab plus irinotecan prolongs overall survival (OS) compared
      with irinotecan alone. Subjects in Part 2 will be randomized in a 2:2:1 fashion to 1 of 3
      treatment groups: (A) irinotecan; (B) dinutuximab plus irinotecan; or (C) topotecan.
      Randomization will be stratified by duration of response to prior platinum therapy
      (relapse-free period &lt;3 months or ≥3 months).
