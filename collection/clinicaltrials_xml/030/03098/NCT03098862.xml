  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2013-2015 Ebola Virus outbreak in Western Africa was unprecedented in size and
      geographic scope. There were over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. During and following the
      outbreak, it became evident that spectrum of disease being observed in the communities and
      the Ebola treatment units was much broader than previously thought. In this study, we aim to
      identify host genetic factors that underlie the observed variation in disease
      susceptibility, severity, clinical sequelae, viral persistence, and serological response. We
      will enroll EVD survivors, close contacts of survivors, EVD healthcare workers, and
      individuals who have received investigational Ebola vaccines (population controls), and
      collect a blood sample, HIV/syphilis infection status, demographics, and medical history
      from participants. Most subjects will complete study participation after a single study
      visit; subjects having HIV/syphilis testing done as part of this study will return for a
      second visit to receive their HIV/syphilis test results and post-test counseling. We will
      genotype participants and compare results between cohorts to address the study aims. This
      may provide insight into pathogenesis and host immunity and potentially suggest new methods
      of intervention.

               -  Positive EBOV serology or documented RT-PCR positive status

               -  Willing to allow storage of biological samples for future research purposes

          -  Direct EBOV exposure control:

               -  At least 3 years of age

               -  Meets at least 1 of the following:

                    -  Household member, family member, friend, care-provider, or sexual partner
                       of survivor who was in close-contact with the survivor within 3 weeks of
                       the EVD event, and has no history of an ETU stay or treatment for EVD at a
                       CCC or holding center
