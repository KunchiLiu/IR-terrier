  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural spinal cord stimulation for the purpose of facilitating volitional movement is a
      new and novel neuromodulatory treatment. Epidural SCS has a long history of use for chronic
      pain with established medical device platforms. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      and establish the use of SCS for volitional movement. Specifically, establishing the
      disinhibitory effect of SCS in a greater population with inherent greater variability.

      In addition to establishing the disinhibitory effect of SCS for cSCI, our study attempts to
      explore the parameter space of the spinal cord stimulator platforms in order to optimize
      stimulation settings for patients through the creation of a clinical decision support system
      (CDSS). Preliminary evidence suggests benefit to autonomic function, and this study also
      begins to explore the effects of SCS on cardiovascular function, urinary function,
      psychiatric outcomes, and quality of life, which all offer significant potential for
      patients suffering from chronic spinal cord injury.
