  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10% of the cases referred to the specialist diagnostic haemato-pathology service at RMH are
      for cytopenias.

      The hypothesis to be tested is that a proportion of patients with idiopathic cytopenias have
      mutations in myelodysplasic syndrome (MDS)-associated genes. The investigators will sequence
      a panel of known MDS-associated genes in patient material (bone marrow and blood) that is
      sent routinely to the diagnostic service where conventional techniques have failed to
      establish a clear diagnosis. 200 patients with idiopathic cytopenia will be followed up to
      determine their survival, blood counts and development of acute leukaemia and other
      haematological malignancies. The clinical outcomes will be correlated with any mutations
      detected.

      Patients with cytopenias will be identified by their local District General Consultant
      haematologist and consent obtained. A bone marrow sample will be sent to RMH as per usual
      diagnostic pathway.

      Once received at the RMH, an aliquot will be frozen down for sequencing by the Molecular
      Pathology lab. Only those cases of cytopenia without a specific diagnosis will be the focus
      of this study.

      Results will be fed back to referring consultants with caveats regarding significance.

      Patients will undergo telephone follow up and data will also be provided by local
      consultants.

      The investigators will look at overall survival, development of haematological malignancies
      and full blood count. This will occur annually.

      Next-generation sequencing will occur looking at target genes in the marrow to identify
      mutations.

      DNA will be sequenced to allow us to determine acquired mutations in haematopoietic tissue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Patients &gt;= 18 years old

          -  Life expectancy more than 12 months

          -  Cytopenia defined as Hb &lt; 110g/L and/or Neutrophils &lt;1.5 x109/L and/or Platelets &lt;100
             x109/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known haematological malignancy or aplastic anaemia/paroxysmal nocturnal
             haemoglobinuria

             investigations have occurred). These include haematinic deficiency (patients
             unresponsive to appropriate haematinic deficiency may enter the study), autoimmune
             cytopenias, chronic renal anaemia (for those with isolated anaemia), known
             haemoglobinopathy (for those with isolated anaemia), chronic viral diseases (Hep
             B/C/HIV), cytopenias associated with liver disease, cytopenias associated with
             systemic autoimmune conditions (eg SLE, rheumatoid arthritis), anaemia of chronic
             disease (for those with isolated anaemia).

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy or other myelosuppressive drugs or radiotherapy within 12
             months

          -  Inadequate bone marrow sample for gene testing
