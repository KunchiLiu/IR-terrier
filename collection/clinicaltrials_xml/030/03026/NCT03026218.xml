  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A critical variation in the provision of prenatal care to women with GDM is the need to keep
      patients engaged with their care between visits by tracking glucose levels using finger
      sticks and making dietary and other lifestyle modifications to keep these levels at or close
      to normal. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the use of mobile devices can improve
      medical outcomes. In order to keep patients engaged between appointments and improve
      self-care/lifestyle, we will study the use of a glucose monitoring system with nutrition
      therapy called GlucoseMama(GM). GM is a mobile app on the iOS system that individuals with
      GDM will use to tract blood sugars and number of carbs consumed. In addition, it will give
      the user positive feedback and rewards for using the system. This model of group care with
      mobile phone monitoring and reminders for women with GDM has not been previously studied. A
      randomized control trial is purposed to determine if this approach improves patient care.
      The investigators hypothesize that group prenatal care along with inter-session mobile
      therapy will increase dietary compliance and therefore reduce the number of individuals
      requiring pharmacologic therapy and improve neonatal outcomes during pregnancy. Group
      prenatal care (GPC) will provide a community foundation to improve learning and increase the
      motivation of patients to learn and change. This motivation will be further strengthened by
      the use of the GlucoseMama monitoring system which will provide each patient with glucose
      tracking and individualized nutritional support.
