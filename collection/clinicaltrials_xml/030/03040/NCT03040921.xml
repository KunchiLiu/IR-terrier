      This prospective nonrandomized multicenter phase I study, will evaluate the feasibility of
      performing uterine transposition before chemoradiation for rectal cancer and uterine
      reimplantation after the treatment.

      Patients with pelvic cancer frequently require radiotherapy, which causes infertility even
      at low doses. Oocytes are highly sensitive to radiation, as a dose of 2 Gy is able to
      destroy up to 50% of the oocyte population.

      Pelvic radiotherapy with fertility preservation is not yet available for women with pelvic
      tumors. In such cases, the only options are egg and/or embryo freezing and ovarian
      transposition (OT), which might preserve reproductive and hormonal function, respectively.
      While ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation are possible, they are still
      experimental.

      Uterine and adnexal transposition (UT) to the upper abdomen before radiotherapy might
      protect these organs, and the later repositioning of the uterus into the pelvis after
      radiotherapy might allow the patients to experience a normal pregnancy.

      Methods:

      Patients with pelvic cancer who will need pelvic radiation will be offered the possibility
      to performed the uterine transposition before the radiation therapy and after the treatment
      the uterus will be replaced in it's natural position. The study period is 2 years or 10
      patients, that happens first.

      The suggested treatment consisted of oocyte or embryos vitrification or before the uterine
      transposition, but this is not mandatory.

      Patient preparation as well as the equipment and trocars placement will be performed as
      usual for approaching the pelvis and dissecting the retroperitoneal space. The following
      provides each step of the surgical procedure: sectioning of the round ligament; opening of
      the broad ligament; dissection of the vesicovaginal space; sealing and sectioning of the
      uterine vessels at the level of their junction with the cervix; sealing and sectioning of
      the pericervical vessels and uterosacral ligaments; sectioning of the vagina and subsequent
      freeing of the uterus followed by closure of the vagina with absorbable sutures; dissection
      of the infundibulopelvic (IP) ligaments up to their intersection with the iliac vessels;
      separation of the terminal ileum, right, sigmoid and descending colon are from the
      retroperitoneal space to dissect the gonadal vessels up to their origin; transposition of
      the uterus into the upper abdomen, and repositioning of the colon and ileum below the arch
      formed by the uterus, adnexa and the corresponding vessels; fixation of the round ligaments
      and gonadal vessels to the upper abdomen by means of a transparietal suture to avoid
      herniation or by moving them into the pelvis; draining the pneumoperitoneum and placement of
      transabdominal sutures at the site; fixation of the cervix to the umbilical incision to
      allow for menstruation from the navel; and visual inspection of the cervix, which indicates
      the end of the surgical procedure. The adnexa should not be contacted at any time during
      surgery.

      Postoperative care will be performed as for major procedures in gynecology. Visual
      inspection of the cervix will be performed twice per day, and uterine perfusion was assessed
      every 2 days by Doppler ultrasound of the ovarian vessels. The patient is discharged 4 days
      after surgery if no complications occur. Three-dimensional radiotherapy or
      Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy following the standard treatment for the disease will
      start 10 to 14 days later. Chemotherapy may be used, also following the usual treatment. No
      protocol in chemotherapy and radiotherapy must follow the standard treatment of the disease,
      no adaptations are accepted.

      Five weeks after the end of radiotherapy, in rectal cancer cases, rectosigmoidectomy with
      total mesorectal excision (TME) and repositioning of the uterus will be performed. Patients
      with other tumors that do not need surgery as part of its treatment, the uterine
      repositioning will be performed 30 days after the end of the treatment.

      The repositioning procedures is performed as follows: First, the cervix is separated from
      the navel, and the first trocar is inserted. Second, adhesions are removed, and the uterus
      and adnexa are repositioned into the pelvis. Rectosigmoidectomy with laparoscopic TME then
      followed the usual technique., Chromotubation is performed at the end of the procedure to
      demonstrate tubal patency. Patients without complications are expected to be discharged4
      days after surgery.

      Seven days after surgery, cervical inspection is performed. Image exams will be performed as
      clinically indicated in the postoperative period. Clinical evaluation with pelvic
      examination will be performed every week for 4 weeks, then every months for 6 months and
      after that every 3 months for 2 years. Complications form will be filled in all clinical
      evaluations. Every 3 months, quality of life protocols will be applied. Abdominal and pelvic
      Magnetic resonance will be performed 1, 6 and 12 months after the surgery. Transvaginal
      ultrasound will be performed 2, 4 and 6 months after the surgery. Hormonal evaluation will
      be performed every 3 months. Tumor follow-up will be performed according to the institution
      protocols. It is recommend to the patients to wait for 1 year before trying pregnancy.

      Reports concerning safety will be presented every 6 months to the local Ethics Committee. No
      uterine necrosis is expected and in case of 2 uterine necrosis, the study will be stoped. Up
      to two local recurrences in the study period are accepted, but in case of a third
      recurrence, the study will be stoped. All complication will be reviewed by the local board
      and the study will be under permanent evaluation. Every 6 months the local board will
      provide a report allowing the study to continue or not.
