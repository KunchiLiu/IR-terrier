      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, parallel-group, single dose study. This
      study will enroll up to 24 subjects and will include 2 hepatic impaired subject groups and
      one group of control subjects with normal hepatic function.

      This study will enroll up to 24 subjects and will include 2 hepatic impaired subject groups
      and one group of control subjects with normal hepatic function.

      Approximately four subjects with mild hepatic impairment will be enrolled first (Group 1).
      To ensure subject safety, following dosing of these first four subjects, a safety meeting
      will take place to review the safety data prior to dosing additional subjects. After safety
      and pharmacokinetic (PK) results from the first four subjects have been reviewed, an
      additional four subjects with mild hepatic impairment (remainder of Group 1) will be
      enrolled concurrently with the moderated hepatic impairment group (Group 2). Thereafter,
      matched subjects with normal hepatic function (Group 3) will be enrolled.

      All subjects will participate in one treatment period and will receive a single dose of
      lasmiditan in the fasting state.
