    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, nonrandomized, absorption, metabolism, and excretion study
      of [14C]-lasmiditan administered as a 200-mg (approximately 100 µCi) oral solution to 8
      healthy male and female subjects, following at least a 10 hour fast from food to assess the
      pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, and routes and extent of elimination of a single oral
      dose of 200 mg (approximately 100 µCi) [14C] lasmiditan in healthy male and female subjects.

         11. participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an
             investigational study drug occurred within 5 half-lives (if known) or 30 days prior
             to Check-in, whichever is longer;

         15. donation of whole blood from 56 days prior to Screening through Discharge, inclusive,
             or of plasma from 30 days prior to Screening through Discharge, inclusive;

         16. receipt of blood products within 2 months prior to Check-in;

         17. subject is at imminent risk of suicide (positive response to question 4 or 5 on the
             baseline C-SSRS) or had a suicide attempt within 6 months prior to the Screening
             visit;

         18. any acute or chronic condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator (or
             designee), would limit the subject's ability to complete or participate in this

         19. any other unspecified reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator (or designee)
