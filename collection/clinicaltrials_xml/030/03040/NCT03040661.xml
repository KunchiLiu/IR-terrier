  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo ablation for AF typically have 2 sheaths placed in each groin,
      including a large sheath when the Cryo Balloon is used for pulmonary vein isolation. During
      the procedure, heparin is administered to maintain a target ACT &gt; 300 seconds. At the
      conclusion of the procedure, the venous sheaths are removed and hemostasis is obtained.
      There are at least 2 ways of obtaining hemostasis after venous access. In the manual
      hemostasis approach, an ACT is checked and protamine is administered. The ACT is rechecked
      20&quot; later, and if &lt; 220 msec, the sheaths are pulled and hemostasis is achieved with manual
      pressure (Manual Hemostasis Group). Another approach is to place a Figure of 8 suture around
      the sheaths in each groin to achieve hemostasis as the sheaths are removed, and therefore
      obviate the need for assessment of the ACT, protamine administration, and manual pressure
      (Figure of 8 Group).
