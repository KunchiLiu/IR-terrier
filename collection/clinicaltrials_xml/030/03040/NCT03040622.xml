    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate thrombogenicity in patients undergoing left atrial appendage
      closure using the WATCHMAN device. Parameters of thrombosis and platelet function, as well
      as other bio-markers, will be measure before, during, and after WATCHMAN implantation at
      several follow up visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject indicated and scheduled for WATCHMAN device implantation at IHVI.

          -  Subject may be of either sex and of any race, and must be &gt;18 years of age.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to give appropriate informed consent.

          -  The subject is able to read and has signed and dated the informed consent document
             including authorization permitting release of personal health information approved by
             the investigator's Institutional Review Board (IRB).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Subjects with contraindications for WATCHMAN device implantation Intracardiac thrombus
        is visualized by echocardiographic imaging An atrial septal defect repair or closure
        device or a patent foramen ovale repair or closure device is present The LAA anatomy will
        not accommodate a device Any of the customary contraindications for other percutaneous
        catheterization procedures (e.g., patient size too small to accommodate TEE probe or
        required catheters) or conditions (e.g., active infection, bleeding disorder) are present.

        There are contraindications to the use of warfarin, aspirin, or clopidogrel The patient
        has a known hypersensitivity to any portion of the device material or the individual
        components such that the use of the WATCHMAN Device is contraindicated

          -  Concurrent participation in any investigational study.

          -  Subject likely to not be available to complete all protocol-required study visits or
             procedures, to the best of the subject's and investigator's knowledge

          -  History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition, or
             disease other than those outlined above that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent, would pose a
             risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures, or
             completion.
