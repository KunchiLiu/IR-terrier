      This is a randomized phase II study assessing the activity of docetaxel combined with
      nivolumab compared to docetaxel alone in metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects who recently progressed on single-agent nivolumab.

      Upon registration, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment with
      docetaxel alone or docetaxel in combination with nivolumab, and stratified according to
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-1 vs 2.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Eligible subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with either:

      Arm A: docetaxel 75 mg/meters squared (mg/m2) plus nivolumab 360 mg IV every 21 days

      Arm B: docetaxel alone 75 mg/m2 every 21 days

      For both treatment arms, 21 days equals 1 cycle of therapy and subjects will be eligible to
      continue treatment until progressive disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      v1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or unacceptable toxicity.

      The following screening labs to demonstrate adequate organ function must be performed within
      30 days prior to registration:

      Hematological:

        -  White Blood Cell (WBC) ≥ 2 k/mm3

        -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3

        -  Platelets &gt;100k

        -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40 cc/min

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin 1.5 ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN)

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 1.5 × ULN

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 1.5 × ULN

      Coagulation:

        -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) or Activated Partial
           Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤ 2 × ULN

      (Note: use of vitamin K antagonist is not allowed)

        this study:

          -  Written informed consent and the American Health Insurance Portability and
             Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) authorization for release of personal health
             information prior to registration. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the
             informed consent or obtained separately.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-2 within 30 days
             prior to registration.

          -  Histological or cytological confirmed non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 within 30 days prior to registration.

          -  A subject with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their
             treatment for brain metastasis at least 4 weeks prior to study registration, have
             been off of corticosteroids for ≥ 2 weeks, and are asymptomatic.

          -  Subjects must have had clinical benefit while on single agent nivolumab defined as at
             least a 3 month PFS, and now have progression.

          -  Most recent therapy must have been treatment with single agent Nivolumab. Subjects
             must have experienced disease progression during or after single agent Nivolumab
             therapy.

          -  Most recent Nivolumab infusion must be completed at least 6 weeks of randomization.
             The subject must have recovered from all reversible acute toxic effects (other than
             alopecia) to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline.

          -  MANDATORY archival tumor tissue (prior to treatment with single agent Nivolumab) must
             be identified prior to registration and obtained during the screening period.
             Confirmation of acquisition should occur prior to C1D1 treatment. Unavailability of
             tissue will render the subject ineligible for study. Biopsy should be excisional,
             incisional or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is insufficient. Sample requirement
             is FFPE block + 1 H&amp;E stained slide or 25 unstained slides + 1 H&amp;E stained slide.

          -  MANDATORY biopsy after registration and prior to C1D1 treatment: Primary tumor or a
             metastatic lesion must be amenable to biopsy after registration and prior to C1D1
             treatment for PD-L1 status and other correlative studies. Biopsy should be
             excisional, incisional or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is insufficient.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 14 days prior to registration. These women must also have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within
             24 hours prior to the start of Nivolumab then every 6 weeks thereafter. NOTE: Women
             are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have
             undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is
             post-menopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a
             woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In
             addition, women under the age of 62 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating
             hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be willing to abstain from heterosexual activity
             or use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception from the time of informed
             consent until 5 months after treatment discontinuation. The two contraception methods
             can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal method.
             Women cannot breast feed from the time of informed consent to 5 months after last
             dose of study treatment.

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving Nivolumab and who are sexually
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7
             months after the last dose of investigational product.

          -  As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject
             to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:

          -  Prior treatment with docetaxel.

          -  Previous autoimmune complication from nivolumab requiring discontinuation of therapy
             or treatment with steroids (ongoing treatment with more than 10 mg of prednisone or
             steroid equivalent daily, excluding inhaled or topical steroids).

          -  Previous discontinuation from Nivolumab due to an adverse event.

          -  Prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L-2, anti-CD-137, or anti-CTLA-4
             antibody (including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting
             T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways). Exception: nivolumab.

          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that would impair
             the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while
             the mother is being treated on study).

          -  Known additional malignancy that is active and/or progressive requiring treatment;
             exceptions include basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical or
             bladder cancer, or other cancer for which the subject has been disease-free for at
             least five years.

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects with brain metastases are
             eligible if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) evidence of progression for [lowest minimum is 4 weeks or more] after treatment
             is complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration.
             There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic
             corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to
             study drug administration.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to registration.

          -  Subjects whose tumors express EGFR mutations on exons 19 and 21, ALK rearrangement,
             or ROS1 rearrangement who still have other FDA approved targeted agents available for
             treatment.

          -  Subjects with an active or recent history of a known or suspected autoimmune disease
             or recent history of a syndrome that required systemic
             corticosteroids/immunosuppressive medications EXCEPT for syndromes which would not be
             expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger. (Subjects with vitiligo,
             autoimmune thyroiditis, or type I diabetes mellitus are permitted to enroll.)

          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab, drugs with a
             predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution in subjects treated with
             nivolumab-containing regimen.

          -  Subjects should be excluded if they are positive test for hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating
             acute or chronic infection.

          -  Subjects should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          -  History of allergy to study drug components.
