      Acceptability and tolerance of a new food product in adults and children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acceptability and tolerance testing will be conducted in 10 healthy male adult volunteers
      and 10 (40 - 60 years of age), and in children (9-13 years of age). All participants will be
      asked to consume 50g of a test product every day for 2 weeks for the adult volunteers, while
      the children will be asked to consume the same product every day for one week. The
      participants will record amount of daily intake, and will be given an entry and exit
      surveys. These surveys will include the assessment of potential gastrointestinal changes
      with daily product intake, and will include questions on how they liked the product.
      Acceptability will be measured as the number of servings and portion of serving completed
      each day over the trial period.

      In adults only, fasting blood samples and a spot urine will be collected towards preliminary
      work on potential changes in the metabolome and lipidome with the inclusion of the test
      product within the habitual diet.
