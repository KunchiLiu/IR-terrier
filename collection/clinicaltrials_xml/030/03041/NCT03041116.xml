      This study will investigate whether fosmetpantotenate (RE-024), a phosphopantothenate
      replacement therapy, is safe and effective in treating patients with Pantothenate
      Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a diagnosis of PKAN as indicated by confirmed mutations in the
             pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) gene.

          2. The patient is male or female aged 6 to 65 years, inclusive.

          3. The patient has a score of &gt;6 on the PKAN-specific activities of daily living measure
             (PKAN-ADL)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has required regular or intermittent invasive ventilatory support to
             maintain vital signs within 24 weeks prior to randomization.

          2. The patient has had a deep brain stimulation (DBS) device implanted within 6 months
             prior to screening.

          3. The patient has taken deferiprone within 30 days prior to screening.

          4. The patient is unable to maintain stable doses of allowed concomitant medications for
             the first 24 weeks of the study.
