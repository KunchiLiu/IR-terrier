  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect on leukocyte and
      plasma Iduronate 2-Sulfatase (IDS) enzyme activity of ascending doses of SB-913. SB-913 is
      an intravenously delivered Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) Therapeutic for genome editing. It
      inserts a correct copy of the IDS gene into the Albumin locus in hepatocytes with the goal
      of lifelong therapeutic production of the IDS enzyme.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to provide long term expression of IDS and improve the
      current clinical outcome of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in subjects with MPS II, a
      recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from mutations in the gene encoding IDS.
      SB-913 is a therapeutic for ZFN-mediated genome editing which will be delivered by
      adeno-associated virus (AAV)-derived vectors. SB-913 is intended to function by placement of
      the corrective copy of IDS transgene into the genome of the subject's own hepatocytes, under
      the control of the highly expressed endogenous albumin locus, and is expected to provide
      permanent, liver-specific expression of Iduronate 2-Sulfatase for the lifetime of an MPS II
      patient.
