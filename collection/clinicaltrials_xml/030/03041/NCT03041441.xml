  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the intracranial pressure (ICP, the pressure in
      your head) in subjects with intracranial hypotension (a condition caused by leakage of the
      fluid that surrounds your brain and spine) using non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) techniques, and to determine whether changes in estimated ICP are seen after treatment
      of this condition.
