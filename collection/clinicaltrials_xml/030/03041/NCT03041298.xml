    <textblock>
      Guerbet conducted a non-interventional post-marketing surveillance study on its Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agent Dotarem (gadoteric acid/gadoterate meglumine) from
      September 2011 to December 2013. The aim of this study, which was conducted in accordance
      with section 67, paragraph 6 of the German drug regulation, Arzneimittelgesetz, was to
      generate additional data on the diagnostic efficacy, reliability and safety of Dotarem in
      Magnetic Resonance (MR) mammography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic efficacy was assessed on the basis of image quality (5-stage scale from
      &quot;excellent&quot; to &quot;very poor&quot;), diagnosis and cytology test result. Safety was assessed on the
      basis of the frequency and seriousness of adverse drug reactions observed following the
      injection of Dotarem.
