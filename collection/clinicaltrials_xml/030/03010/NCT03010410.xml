  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with immunosenescence and impaired host defense mechanisms, contributing
      to influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Preliminary data demonstrate that the platelet
      transcriptome is markedly different between healthy subjects and influenza patients.
      Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM) family members are among the transcripts
      significantly increased in platelets during influenza and expression of IFITM-3 is impaired
      in elderly subjects, a pattern associated with increased mortality. This study will build on
      these data and investigate if aging influences the expression of platelet IFITM family
      members in patients with influenza and sepsis.

      This study will prospectively determine if aging alters the induction of (IFITMs) in
      platelets from hospitalized influenza and sepsis patients. The study will also determine if
      diminished expression of IFITM family members correlates with an increased risk of adverse
      outcomes in older influenza and sepsis patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥18 years old at the time of enrollment

          -  Meet one of the following three main criteria:

        A. INFLUENZA (AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUS) PATIENTS:

        Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a primary microbiologic diagnosis
        of influenza (any strain) or other routinely clinically identified respiratory viruses
        within 1 week of symptom onset. Influenza or other respiratory virus will be diagnosed
        using an RT-PCR viral panel on a respiratory tract specimen, as is currently standard of
        care on patients admitted to the ICUs at IMC with respiratory symptoms.

        OR

        B. SEPSIS PATIENTS:

        Sepsis patients must have

          1. Suspected or confirmed infection

             AND

          2. Organ dysfunction as defined by a SOFA &gt;= 2 above baseline (if no baseline data
             available, SOFA assumed to be 0)

        OR

        C. SEPTIC SHOCK PATIENTS:

        AFTER INFUSION OF 20ML/KG CRYSTALLOID OR EQUIVALENT, Septic shock patients must have

          1. Suspected or confirmed infection

             AND

             immune deficiency, agammaglobulinemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, leukocyte adhesion
             defects, IgA deficiency, etc.)

          -  Have neutropenia (&lt;1,000/mm3)

          -  Have received immunosuppressant medications within the previous 30 days (e.g.,
