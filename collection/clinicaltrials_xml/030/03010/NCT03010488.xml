  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous data suggest some depressed patients act as if their internal biological clock is
      out of sync with the outside world and re-aligning their clock with the timing of sunlight
      lessens their depressed mood and accompanying depressive symptoms. This &quot;chronotherapy&quot; may
      produce remission during the first week of treatment while causing minimal problems. This
      study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of chronotherapy by comparing two protocols for
      inducing sleep phase advance. Which chronotherapy condition a participant will receive will
      be determined randomly (i.e., by chance, essentially a computerized flip of a coin). Prior
      to determination of which protocol a patient will follow, each patient will declare their
      desired sleep time (for example, 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.). All patients will be assigned specific
      times to sleep and sit in front of bight lights wearing clear or amber goggles. Assigned
      sleep times will differ between groups using different strategies to shift the timing of
      their sleep from their ideal sleep time as determined by their MEQ score to their desired
      sleep time. All participants will be rated daily by telephone for the first week following
      randomization, and then weekly for an additional five weeks. Whenever possible, weekly
      visits will be in person, although telephone visits will be allowed. All participants will
      be rated at baseline, 1 week and 6 weeks by an Independent Evaluator blind to treatment
      assignment (as well as the nature of the treatment and if it has occurred or not). After the
      six week post-randomization evaluation, all participants will be offered six months of
      continued treatment and be rated monthly. Treatment during this six month period may consist
      of Chronotherapy or conventional antidepressants as the patient and doctor determine.
      Standard ratings of depression, over-all illness and functioning will be obtained. Change in
      the symptom measures will determine treatment efficacy. Analysis of saliva melatonin levels,
      sleep logs and activity monitor data will measure the timing of the biological clock and
      whether it has been shifted by the treatment. Measures of functioning will determine whether
      functioning improves coincident with, independent of, or subsequent to mood improvement.
