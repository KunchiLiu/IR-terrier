  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcer represents a frequent clinical condition in patient with spinal cord injury
      or after prolonged Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay. Osteomyelitis constitutes a severe
      complication with a poorly known management, and is associated with a high rate of relapse,
      leading to a high-burden in hospital bed-days, financial cost, surgical intervention,
      antibiotic use, morbidity and mortality, and nursing care. In our reference center for bone
      and joint infection management, the medical and surgical strategies are systematically
      discussed during pluridisciplinary meetings. Most patients benefit from a two-stage surgical
      strategy (debridement with initiation of vacuum-assisted closure therapy until
      reconstruction using muscular flap) with prolonged antimicrobial therapy. In this context,
      our study aims to evaluate this complex approach and to determine risk factors of treatment
      failure in order to improve patient management, focusing on optimization of empirical
      antimicrobial therapy after each surgical stage, delay between the two surgical stage, and
      duration of antimicrobial therapy.
