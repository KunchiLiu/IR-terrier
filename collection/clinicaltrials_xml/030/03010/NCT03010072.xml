  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, open-label, controlled, randomized, cross-over study
      in 34 prevalent end-stage renal disease patients on chronic hemodialysis treatment with
      hyperphosphatemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive low-dose (250mg/d) PA-21
      followed by high-dose (2000mg/d) PA-21 (sequence A-B) or to receive high-dose PA21 followed
      by low-dose PA21 (sequence B-A) with washout-phases in between. An open label design with a
      sub-therapeutic dose of PA21 as control treatment was chosen because creating a convincing
      placebo for PA21 is not feasible.

      The study will start with two study visits on the 2nd and 3rd dialysis session of the week ,
      where dialysis patients are still treated with standard of care to establish baseline values
      (duration: 0.5 weeks). Next will be an initial run-in wash-out phase, where all phosphate
      binders taken by the patient as standard of care treatment will be discontinued and no
      phosphate binders will be introduced. Consequently, there will be a PA21 treatment (high
      dose/low dose) phase, followed by a wash-out phase, followed by another PA21 treatment (high
      dose/low dose) phase, followed by a final wash-out phase. Each study phase, including
      wash-out phases as well as low-dose and high-dose treatment phases will be 14 days of
      duration. Patients will be followed up to 10.5 weeks after randomization until the last
      study visit of the final wash-out phase.
