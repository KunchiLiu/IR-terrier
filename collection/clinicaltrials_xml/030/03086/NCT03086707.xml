  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to evaluate the nasal mucociliary clearance (NMC) by determining the
      value obtained for saccharin transit time (STT) test over the course of 12 hours following a
      single cigarette use in smokers, to compare it relative to never smokers, and to examine the
      relationship between plasma nicotine levels and STT value in smokers and never smokers.
      Safety will also be monitored during the study.

      The planned maximum study duration for a single study participant from Screening through
      completion of study will be 33 days.

    <measure>Saccharin transit time at t0, start of product use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Before performing the test, each subject will spend approximately 15 minutes acclimatizing to the environment of the clinic. A 1-2 mm particle of saccharin will be placed under direct vision, approximately 1 cm behind the anterior end of the inferior turbinate. The position of the subject's head should be flexed approximately 10° by visual assessment.
The saccharin transit time will be determined as the elapsed time in minutes and seconds from placement of the saccharin until the time the subject perceives a sweet taste.</description>

               -  eCO levels &gt;10 parts per million (ppm).

               -  No plans to quit smoking in the next 3 months.

          -  Never smokers:

                  cigarettes in the past 3 years.

               -  A negative urine cotinine test (&lt;200 ng/mL).

               -  eCO levels ≤ 5 ppm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As per the Investigator's judgment, the subject cannot participate in the study for

             interfere with the procedures for upper or lower airway function. This could include,
             but is not limited to, nasal/septum deviations, or nasal polyps or nasal allergies.
