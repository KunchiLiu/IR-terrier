      This proposed pilot study of a Tai Chi intervention among older adults with multisite pain
      is a direct extension of the investigators' current work examining attentional demands of
      chronic pain in the older population. The main purpose of this randomized controlled trial
      is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week Tai Chi program for older adults
      with chronic multisite pain and a history of falling. The investigators will examine the
      effects of Tai Chi on pain characteristics, cognitive function, cognitively-mediated
      mobility, and levels of pain-related biomarkers in community-dwelling older adults with
      multisite pain and at least one fall in the past year (65 years and older, N=30 for Tai Chi
      group and N=30 for mild exercise control group). The specific aims for this R21
      developmental grant application are: 1) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a
      12-week randomized controlled Tai Chi program in preparation for a larger trial in
      community-residing older adults. Specifically, the investigators will: 1A) Evaluate the
      feasibility of recruitment and engagement of older adults who have chronic multisite pain in
      a 12-week Tai Chi intervention; 1B) Determine the optimal Tai Chi/exercise protocol and data
      collection protocol for planning a larger trial; 1C) Assess the adherence of randomized
      participants to their assigned treatment; 1D) Obtain information on differences in outcome
      measures and variations to be used for power analysis in a larger trial. 2) To examine the
      efficacy of Tai Chi on pain characteristics, pain-related biomarkers, cognitive function and
      cognitively-mediated mobility. Specifically, the investigators will: 2A) Determine the
      effects of Tai Chi on measures of pain severity and pain interference; 2B) Determine the
      effects of Tai Chi on performance in tests of attention and executive function; 2C)
      Determine the effects of Tai Chi on performance in complex mobility tasks (dual task gait
      measures); 2D) Determine the effects of Tai Chi on levels of C-reactive protein (CRP),
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and beta endorphin (β-endorphin).

      Accumulating evidence supports that more pain, whether measured by number of pain sites or
      pain severity, is associated with poorer cognitive function and mobility, and fall risk in
      older persons. The attentional burden of pain may be a factor in the high rate of falls
      among older persons who have chronic multisite pain. Tai Chi which holistically integrates
      physical and cognitive functions offers the possibility not only of alleviating pain but
      also improving attention and mobility in the many older adults who have chronic multisite
      pain. This proposed pilot study of a Tai Chi intervention among older adults with multisite
      pain is a direct extension of the investigators' current work examining attentional demands
      of chronic pain in the older population. The main purpose of this randomized controlled
      trial is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week Tai Chi program for older
      adults with chronic multisite pain and a history of falling. The investigators will examine
      the effects of Tai Chi on pain characteristics, cognitive function, cognitively-mediated
      mobility, and levels of pain-related biomarkers in community-dwelling older adults with
      multisite pain and at least one fall in the past year (65 years and older, N=30 for Tai Chi
      group and N=30 for mild exercise control group). The specific aims for this R21
      developmental grant application are: 1) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a
      12-week randomized controlled Tai Chi program in preparation for a larger trial in
      community-residing older adults. Specifically, the investigators will: 1A) Evaluate the
      feasibility of recruitment and engagement of older adults who have chronic multisite pain in
      a 12-week Tai Chi intervention; 1B) Determine the optimal Tai Chi/exercise protocol and data
      collection protocol for planning a larger trial; 1C) Assess the adherence of randomized
      participants to their assigned treatment; 1D) Obtain information on differences in outcome
      measures and variations to be used for power analysis in a larger trial. 2) To examine the
      efficacy of Tai Chi on pain characteristics, pain-related biomarkers, cognitive function and
      cognitively-mediated mobility. Specifically, the investigators will: 2A) Determine the

      measures); 2D) Determine the effects of Tai Chi on levels of C-reactive protein (CRP),
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and beta endorphin (β-endorphin).
      This study will provide novel insights into the effects of a non-invasive behavioral
      intervention, Tai Chi, on chronic multisite pain and the associated cognitive-motor
      functions in older adults. The results of this exploratory study will provide critical pilot
      data that will guide and inform a larger randomized controlled trial designed to establish
      the clinical significance of Tai Chi on chronic multisite pain in older adults and to
      investigate the mechanisms by which Tai Chi may improve chronic pain and pain-related
      cognitive-motor functions using brain imaging and human genetic approaches.
