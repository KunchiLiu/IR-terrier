    <description>Safety of repeated CED of nal-IRI following standard of care focal radiotherapy will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events, scheduled laboratory assessments, vital sign measurements, and physical examinations for subjects who receive the vaccination. The severity of toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0. Adverse events and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (meeting Grade 3, 4, or 5 criteria according to CTCAE) will be summarized by maximum intensity and relationship to study drug(s). Grade 1 and 2 adverse events will be summarized if related to study therapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed DIPG who have completed focal radiotherapy are
             eligible. Patients with disseminated disease are not eligible, and MRI of the spine

             date of the completion of radiotherapy.

          -  Prior Chemotherapy: No prior experimental chemotherapy is allowed. If a subject
             received chemotherapy during radiation, the subject needs to be discussed with the
             study chair(s). The use of temolzolomide is allowed at standard pediatric dosing
             during radiation therapy. All other therapies need to be discussed with the study
             chair.

          -  Prior Radiation: Patients must have received prior treatment with focal radiotherapy
             as part of initial treatment for DIPG and had their last dose at least 28 days prior
             to and no later than 42 days from the first CED treatment with liposomal-irinotecan.

          -  Age ≥ 3 and &lt; 39 years of age.

          -  Karnofsky ≥ 50 for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky ≥ 50 for patients 16 years
             of age and younger. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are
             up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the
             performance score.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks measured from the date of completion of
             radiotherapy.

          -  Corticosteroids: Patients who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or
             decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to registration.

             excluded; the assessment of mass effect should be made by the study chair and study
