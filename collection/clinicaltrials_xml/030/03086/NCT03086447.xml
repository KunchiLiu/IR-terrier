  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-masked, 5-visit, bilateral dispensing, parallel group study to
      demonstrate that the investigational contact lens meets the design requirements related to
      corneal staining, lens fit, visual acuity and rotational performance as well as subjective
      comfort and handling. Subjects will wear the contact lenses for a total of 28-36 days.

    <measure>Monocular distance visual acuity 20/40 or better</measure>
    <time_frame>28-36 days</time_frame>
    <description>Distance time controlled LogMAR Visual Acuity will be carried out binocularly with high luminance and high contrast, at 4m using an ETDRS chart. The average Visual Acuity (LogMAR) will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contact lens related corneal staining</measure>
    <time_frame>28-36 days</time_frame>
    <description>Contact lens related corneal staining will be assessed via slit lamp throughout the study. Corneal staining will be graded using a 5-level scale; 0=no staining, 1=trace, 2=mild, 3=moderate and 4=severe. Observed corneal staining collected during planned and unscheduled visits will be dichotomized whether the corneal staining is 'grade 2 or lower' or 'Grade 3 or higher'.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens fitting acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>28-36 days</time_frame>
    <description>Lens fit characteristics will be assessed via slit lamp in terms of lens position, movement and tightness. Each lens fit collected at fitting will be judged as being either 'acceptable' or 'unacceptable' based on the static and dynamic fit characteristic.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute Rotation</measure>
    <time_frame>28-36 days</time_frame>
    <description>Lens rotation will be assessed via slit lamp with beam that can be rotated. The rotational error (assume shortest distance) and direction (base towards the nose or based towards temple]) will be calculated. Absolute rotation will be dichotomized whether rotation was '&gt; 10-degree' or 'worse' upon 15-minute post insertion at fitting.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stability with blink</measure>
    <time_frame>28-36 days</time_frame>
    <description>Rotational stability with blink will be assessed via slit lamp with beam that can be rotated. The stability of the scribe mark rotational position during a series of normal (unforced) blinks will be observed. Observed rotational stability with blink will be dichotomized whether stability was '&gt; 5-degree' or 'worse' at fitting.</description>

    <measure>Monocular distance visual acuity 20/20 or better</measure>
    <time_frame>28-36 days</time_frame>
    <description>Distance time controlled LogMAR Visual Acuity will be carried out binocularly with high luminance and high contrast, at 4m using an ETDRS chart. The average Visual Acuity (LogMAR) will be reported</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective CLUE comfort score and Subjective CLUE handling score</measure>
    <time_frame>28-36 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective CLUE comfort and handling score will be assessed using the Contact Lens User ExperienceTM (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. A 5 point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% shift in the distribution of scores for population of soft disposable contact lens wearers.</description>
