  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Japanese, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study. This is the first study
      to assess the safety and tolerability as well as explore the pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and antitumor activity of rovalpituzumab tesirine in Japanese participants
      with advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
