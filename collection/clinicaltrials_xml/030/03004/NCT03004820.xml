  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-labeled and phase II futility study. Application of Remote
      ischemic conditioning (RIC) as an adjunctive therapy to medication were involved in the
      study. The study is to test whether RIC is effective in preventing ischemic evens after a
      minor ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack within 3 months and to explore the safety
      and compliance of chronic RIC. Medication strategy is based on physician's best judgement.

      This is a single-arm, open-labeled and phase II futility study. Application of Remote
      ischemic conditioning (RIC) as an adjunctive therapy to medication were involved in the
      study. RIC consisted of five cycles of 5-min inflation (200 mmHg) and 5-min deflation of
      cuff on bilateral upper limbs twice a day. The study is to test whether RIC is effective in
      preventing ischemic evens after a minor ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack within 3
      months and to explore the safety and compliance of chronic RIC. Medication strategy is based
      on physician's best judgement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Eighteen years old or older of any gender or race;

          2. Diagnosed with a non-cardiogenic MIS/TIA within 14 days; MIS is defined by an
             ischemic stroke of score of 3 or less on the NIHSS at the time of inclusion, TIA is
             defined as neurologic deficit attributed to focal brain ischemia, with symptoms
             resolution within 24 h of symptom onset, Symptom onset is defined by the &quot;last see
             normal&quot; principle;

          3. Stable vital signs, normal cardiac, hepatic and renal functions;

          4. Able to consent by himself/herself or by legally authorized representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of hemorrhage or other pathology, such as vascular malformation, tumor,
             abscess or other non-vascular diseases, based on brain CT or MRI;

          2. Modified Rankin Scale score &gt; 2 at inclusion;

          3. Received iv. recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) therapy or
             interventional treatment for the current event;

          4. Contradiction for aspirin or clopidogrel (known allergy, severe asthma or heart
             failure et al.) ;

          5. Clear indication for anticoagulation therapy ( cardiac source of embolus);

          7. Any hemorrhagic transformation;

          8. Gastrointestinal bleed or major surgery within 3 months of symptoms onset;

          9. Stroke or TIA induced by interventional therapy or surgery;

         10. Any upper extremity soft tissue, vascular injury or peripheral blood vessel disease
             which may contraindicate RIC;

         11. Systolic blood pressure greater than 200 mmHg after medication;

         12. Planned revascularization (any angioplasty or vascular surgery) within the next 3
             months ；

         13. Scheduled for surgery or interventional treatment requiring RIC cessation within next
             3 months;

         14. Severe noncardiovascular comorbidity with life expectancy &lt; 3 months;

         15. Pregnancy;

         16. Currently receiving an investigational drug or device by other studies.
