    <textblock>
      LQD is a multicentre randomised clinical trial comparing the clinical and cost effectiveness
      of lithium versus quetiapine when used as add-on therapies to antidepressant medication for
      patients with treatment resistant depression. The Lithium versus Quetiapine in Depression
      (LQD) study will assess patients over 12 months to establish which (if any) treatment is
      more likely to improve TRD over a long duration of time. Professor Anthony Cleare is the
      Chief Investigator and recruitment is due to start in November 2016. Recruitment will begin
      in London, followed by additional sites in Newcastle and Oxford in early 2017.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 12 month parallel group, multi-centre, patient randomised, pragmatic, open label trial
      is comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the decision to prescribe lithium versus
      quetiapine add-on treatment to antidepressant medication. There will be two parallel groups:
      1) Quetiapine add-on to existing antidepressant medication; 2) Lithium add-on to existing
      antidepressant medication. 276 patients will be randomised 1:1 at baseline to the decision
      to prescribe either lithium or quetiapine, and treatment will then be undertaken by
      clinicians on a real world basis. The acute phase of treatment (8 weeks post-randomisation)
      will be conducted by trial clinicians with a decision as to then continue treatment as per
      standard care thereafter. All patients, regardless of their treatment status, will be
      followed up in the trial for one year. This is a superiority design whereby we hypothesise
      that quetiapine will be superior to lithium in terms of time to treatment discontinuation
      and average symptom burden (QID-SR) over 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Under the care of a GP and/or adult mental health services

          2. Current episode of depression meeting DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder
             (MDD) - single or recurrent episode 3.17-item HAM-D score ≥ 14 - this cut-off
             reflects a pragmatic minimum severity of depression as also chosen in comparable
             studies such as STAR*D (Rush et al 2006, Trivedi et al 2006)

        4.Any gender and aged 18 years or over 5.Meet criteria for treatment resistant depression
        (Fekadu et al., 2009a; Cleare et al., 2015): current episode has not responded to at least
        two antidepressants given for at least 6 weeks at minimum therapeutic dose defined as
        fluoxetine ≥20mg/day, paroxetine ≥20mg/day, sertraline ≥50mg/day, citalopram ≥20mg/day,
        escitalopram ≥10mg/day, venlafaxine ≥75mg/day, duloxetine ≥60 mg/day, mirtazapine
        ≥30mg/day, tricyclic antidepressant ≥125mg/day, and dosage as guided by the national
        Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines or BNF for any other antidepressant. Please note, relapse
        whilst on an antidepressant also counts as a failed treatment trial 6.Current
        antidepressant treatment has remained unchanged for ≥6 weeks 7.Provision of written,
        informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder (defined as meeting DSM-5 criteria for bipolar 1 or
             bipolar 2) on the MINI 7.0 (as recommended treatments are different for bipolar
             depression)

          2. Diagnosis of current psychosis (as recommended treatments are different for current
             psychosis - antidepressants plus antipsychotics is the first-line treatment
             recommendation (NiCE, 2009; Cleare et al., 2015)

          3. Use of lithium or quetiapine during current episode

          4. Ongoing use of another atypical antipsychotic (discontinuation will be required
             before study entry i.e. any time prior to randomisation)

          5. Known contraindication to use of either lithium or quetiapine: known hypersensitivity
             of lithium or quetiapine or any of their excipients; severe renal insufficiency /
             impairment; untreated hypothyroidism; severe cardiac disease / insufficiency; low
             sodium levels e.g. dehydrated patients or those on low sodium diets; Addison's
             disease; Brugada syndrome or family history of Brugada syndrome; the rare hereditary
             inborn errors of metabolism galactosaemia, the Lapp lactase deficiency or
             glucose-galactose malabsorption; concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 3A4
             inhibitors; or previously diagnosed QT prolongation.

          6. We will not recruit any individual who is currently participating in a clinical trial
             of an investigational medical product (CTIMP).

          7. Insufficient degree of comprehension or attention to be able to engage in trial
             procedures.

          8. We will exclude women who are pregnant, actively trying for pregnancy, or currently
             breastfeeding. This will be based on verbal report of the subject. Otherwise the
             management will be as appropriate according to standard clinical practice within the
             context of a pragmatic, open trial, for example adequate contraceptive precautions
             decided on the clinical judgement of the prescriber.
