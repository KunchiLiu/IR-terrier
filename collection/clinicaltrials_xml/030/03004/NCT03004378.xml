      This study will be the first to evaluate whether the short- and long-term use of activity
      tracking devices improve short- and long-term weight loss in adolescents. The investigators
      will be the first to establish whether weight loss translates into a change in
      obesity-related biomarkers associated with adolescent obesity. In addition, the
      investigators will be the first to report outcomes after the implementation of activity
      tracking devices in conjunction with an intense adolescent weight loss program.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has provided informed consent in a manner approved by the IRB and is willing
             and able to comply with the trial procedures.

          2. At least 12 and younger than 18 years of age at the time of consent.

          3. BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex group or BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would place the
             subject at increased risk for participation.

          2. Use of an investigational agent in the 30 days prior to signing informed consent

          3. History of prior non-compliance or the presence or history of psychiatric condition
             (including drug or alcohol addiction) that would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             make it difficult for the subject to comply with the study procedures or follow the
             investigators instructions.

          4. Females who are pregnant or lactating

          5. Subjects taking medications that can potentially cause weight gain

          6. Subjects unable to participate in the comprehensive weight loss program due to
             pre-existing conditions (paralysis, heart failure, severe autism or mental
             retardation, psychosis, etc.)

          7. Prisoners
