  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate markers, mechanisms and define general predictors for
      immunological health by comparing influenza vaccine responses in monozygotic and dizygotic
      twins.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to study the immune response to different influenza vaccines much
      more broadly and deeply across different age groups and with different vaccine modalities
      and to probe the influence of genetics on these responses using monozygotic and dizygotic
      twins. The investigators plan to compare various immunological responses, identify
      age-specific biomarkers or clusters of markers, quantify the frequency of influenza-specific
      T-cells pre- and post-vaccination, and determine the effective breadth of T-cell repertoire
      to an influenza vaccine within an individual as a function of age and to what degree this is
      genetically determined.

      Twin Groups A-E will receive a single administration of the 2010-2011 formulation of
      seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). Group F, elderly participants, will
      be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of inactivated vaccine, either the usual dose
      or the high-dose TIV. Blood samples to conduct the assays described will be taken at
      pre-immunization, Days 7-10 and 28 post-immunization.

          1. Otherwise healthy, ambulatory children or adults, ages 8-17 years (identical twin
             pairs), 18-30 years (identical or fraternal twin pairs), 40-59 years (identical or
             fraternal twin pairs) or 70-100 years (identical twin pairs).

          2. Willing to complete the informed consent process.
