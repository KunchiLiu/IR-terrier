      This is a Phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of intravesical BCG plus
      ALT-803 in patients with BCG unresponsive high grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
      (NMIBC). All patients treated in the study will receive via a urinary catheter in the
      bladder, BCG plus ALT-803 weekly for 6 consecutive weeks (induction). Patients without
      disease progression at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12 are eligible for continued BCG+ALT-803
      treatment (maintenance). The study duration is 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients 18 years of age or older

          -  Histologic confirmation of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer of the transitional
             cell carcinoma high-risk subtype

          -  Absence of resectable disease after transurethral resection (TURBT) procedures
             (residual carcinoma in situ (CIS) acceptable; patients with T1 tumors must undergo
             repeat resection and biopsy must include muscularis propria that is negative for
             tumor cells)

          -  BCG-unresponsive disease as defined as: (a) Persistent high-grade disease or
             recurrence within 6 months of receiving at least two courses of intravesical BCG (at
             least five of six induction doses and at least two of three maintenance doses); or
             (b) T1 high-grade disease at the first evaluation following induction BCG alone (at
             least 5 of six induction doses)

          -  Histologically confirmed presence of CIS

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Voluntary written informed consent and HIPAA authorization and agree to comply with
             all protocol-specified procedures and follow-up evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrence &gt; 1 year after last BCG instillation

          -  Current evidence of muscle invasive disease

          -  Life expectancy &lt;5 years

          -  Any of the following clinical laboratory values at the time of enrollment: (1)
             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;800/µL or (2) Platelets &lt; 50,000/µL

          -  Liver function abnormalities as indicated by ongoing hepatic enzyme elevation (AST or
             ALT) &gt;2 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Renal insufficiency as indicated by a creatinine level &gt;3 times ULN

          -  Evidence of muscle-invasive bladder cancer or regional and/or distant metastasis

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure or other clinical
             signs of severe cardiac dysfunction

          -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), severe/unstable angina pectoris, or
             myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry

          -  History or evidence of uncontrollable central nervous system (CNS) disease

          -  Active systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy. All prior
             infections must have resolved following optimal therapy

          -  Concurrent febrile illness, active urinary tract infection, active tuberculosis, a
             history of hypotension or anaphylactic reactions

          -  Ongoing chronic systemic steroid therapy required (&gt;10 mg oral prednisone daily or
             equivalent)

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing. Female patients of childbearing potential must
             have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use adequate contraception for the
             duration of the trial.

          -  Concurrent use of other investigational agents

          -  Other illness or condition, including laboratory abnormalities, which in the opinion
             of the investigator would exclude the patient from participating in this study. This
             includes, but is not limited to, serious medical conditions or psychiatric illness
             likely to interfere with participation in the study.
