    <description>The Bioabsorbable Pulmonary Valved Conduit bio-absorbable, polymer-based medical device.
The PV conduit is used in patients for correction or reconstruction of the Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT), in patients less than 22 years with any of the following congenital heart malformations:
Tetralogy of Fallot
Truncus Arteriosus
Pulmonary Atresia
Transposition of Great Arteries with Ventricular Septal Defect
Pulmonary Stenosis in combination with other defects in congenital heart defect (CHD) syndromes
The PV Conduit can be used for the replacement of previously implanted, but dysfunctional, pulmonary homografts or valved conduits.</description>
