  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate markers, mechanisms and define general predictors for
      immunological health by comparing influenza vaccine responses in monozygotic and dizygotic
      twins.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to study the immune response to different influenza vaccines much
      more broadly and deeply across different age groups and with different vaccine modalities
      and to probe the influence of genetics on these responses using monozygotic and dizygotic
      twins. The investigators plan to compare various immunological responses, identify
      age-specific biomarkers or clusters of markers, quantify the frequency of influenza-specific
      T-cells pre- and post-vaccination, and determine the effective breadth of T-cell repertoire
      to an influenza vaccine within an individual as a function of age and to what degree this is
      genetically determined.

      Twin Groups B-E will receive a single administration of seasonal trivalent inactivated
      influenza vaccine (TIV). Group F, elderly participants, will be randomly assigned to receive
      a single dose of inactivated vaccine, either the usual dose or the high-dose TIV. Blood
      samples to conduct the assays described will be taken at pre-immunization, Days 7-10 and 28
      post-immunization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Otherwise healthy, ambulatory adults, ages 18-30 years (identical or fraternal twin
             pairs), 40-64 years (identical or fraternal twin pairs) or 65-100 years (identical
             twin pairs).

          2. Willing to complete the informed consent process.

          3. Availability for follow-up for the planned duration of the study at least 28 days
             after immunization.

          4. Acceptable medical history and vital signs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             clinically significant liver disease, diabetes mellitus treated with insulin,
             moderate to severe renal disease or any other chronic disorder which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, might jeopardize volunteer safety or compliance with the
             protocol.

          8. Blood pressure &gt;150 systolic or &gt; 95 diastolic at Visit 1

             by the investigator.

         12. Malignancy, other than squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer (includes solid tumors
             such as breast cancer or prostate cancer with recurrence in the past year, and any

             agents such as aspirin (except aspirin up to 325 mg.day), Plavix, or Aggrenox must be
             reviewed by investigator to determine if this would affect the volunteer's safety.

             comply with the study protocol.
