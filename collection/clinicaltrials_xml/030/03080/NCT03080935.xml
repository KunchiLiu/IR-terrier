      This is a multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study designed to assess the extended
      long-term safety of evolocumab in subjects who have completed the FOURIER trial (Study
      20110118). Approximately 1600 subjects will be enrolled in this study. This study will
      continue for 260 weeks (approximately 5 years).

      This is a multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study designed to assess the extended
      long-term safety of evolocumab in subjects who have completed the FOURIER trial (Study
      20110118). FOURIER is a randomized placebo-controlled study of evolocumab, in patients with
      clinically evident atherosclerotic CVD on stable effective statin therapy. Subjects at sites
      participating in FOURIER OLE (Study 20160250) who are eligible and have signed the FOURIER
      OLE informed consent will be enrolled after completion of FOURIER.

      The FOURIER OLE study requires laboratory assessments at day 1, week 12, and thereafter
      approximately every 6 months from day 1; the corresponding blood samples will be processed
      using a central laboratory.

      Upon enrollment in FOURIER OLE study, subjects will receive evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks
      (Q2W) or 420 mg monthly (QM) according to their preference. Frequency and corresponding dose
      of administration can be changed at any scheduled time point where evolocumab is supplied to
      the subject, provided the appropriate supply is available. It is recommended that subjects
      continue the same background lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), including statin, as taken during
      FOURIER.

      This study will continue for 260 weeks (approximately 5 years). Subjects ending
      administration of evolocumab should continue study assessments until the end of study. All
      subjects will be followed and complete procedures/assessments from enrollment through the
      date of study termination unless the subject has withdrawn consent, irrespective of whether
      the subject is continuing to receive treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific
             activities/procedures.

          -  Subject had completed FOURIER (Study 20110118) while still receiving assigned
             Investigational Product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Permanent discontinuation of Investigational Product during FOURIER for any reason
             including an adverse event or serious adverse event.

          -  Currently receiving treatment in another investigational device or drug study, or
             less than 4 weeks since ending treatment on another investigational device or drug
             study(ies). Other investigational procedures while participating in this study are
             excluded.

          -  Subject likely to not be available to complete all protocol-required study visits or
             procedures, and/or to comply with all required study procedures to the best of the

             procedures or completion.

          -  Subject has known sensitivity to any of the active substances or excipients (eg,
             carboxymethylcellulose) to be administered during dosing.
