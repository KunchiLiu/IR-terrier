    <textblock>
      In tuberculosis patients, salivary concentrations will be compared to plasma/serum
      concentrations of several anti-tuberculosis drugs. If salivary concentrations correctly
      represent blood concentrations, this non-invasive sampling of saliva could be used for TDM
      of the tested drugs.

    <textblock>
      TDM (Therapeutic Drug Monitoring) with blood samples is already part of the treatment of
      some tuberculosis (TB) patients to reduce development of drug resistance and toxic drug
      concentrations. Performing TDM with saliva instead of plasma or serum could reduce the
      burden of blood sampling. This study examines if this non-invasive sampling of saliva could
      be used for TDM of several anti-TB drugs.

      The study is an observational cohort study with adult tuberculosis patients as subjects. The
      drugs that are studied are isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin,
      amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, ethionamide, prothionamide, cycloserine, terizidone,
      linezolid, clofazimine, bedaquiline, delamanid, p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS),
      imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, ertapenem, amoxicillin-clavulanate and thioacetazone.

      Saliva samples will be taken simultaneously with blood samples for standard TDM.
      Serum/plasma and saliva drug concentrations will be determined with a validated LC-MS/MS
      (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) method. The correlation and linearity
      between saliva and plasma/serum concentrations will be tested. The saliva-plasma or serum
      ratio based on area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) is calculated for the
      investigated anti-TB drugs. Also pharmacokinetic parameters in serum/plasma and saliva will
      be calculated and compared to provide a complete image of pharmacokinetics of the anti-TB
      drugs in saliva.
