    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized investigator blinded study of 40 men age 20-60 (inclusive) with
      symptoms of mild-moderate PFB based on Investigator Global Assessment (IGA). Subjects will
      be divided into two groups: the Control group of 20 subjects and the Experimental group of
      20 Subjects. Subjects will be seen at Screening/Baseline, and 6 weeks.

      All subjects will use their normal razors and shave products during the six week study. The
      Experimental group of subjects will also be given the study product Pre-Shave Gel and
      Cleansing Brush.

      This will be a randomized investigator blinded study of up to 40 men age 20-60 (inclusive)
      with symptoms of mild-moderate PFB based on Investigator Global Assessment (IGA). Subjects
      will be divided into two groups: the Control group of 20 subjects and the Experimental group
      of 20 Subjects. Subjects will be seen at Screening/Baseline, and 6 weeks.

      All subjects will use their normal razors and shave products during the six week study. The
      Experimental group of subjects will also be given the study product Pre-Shave Gel and
      Cleansing Brush. The study gel and brush will be used prior to their normal shave
      routine.Quantitative lesion counts will be done by trained clinicians at each visit.
      Efficacy assessments include Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scoring
