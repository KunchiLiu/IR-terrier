  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the safety of continued therapy with oral
      treprostinil in subjects who have completed Study TDE-HF-301. This study will provide
      long-term, open-label data regarding the effect of continued long-term oral treprostinil
      therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with heart failure with
      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Subject visits will occur at Baseline, Weeks 6, 12, 18,
      24, and every 12 weeks thereafter until either oral treprostinil becomes commercially
      available to treat PH associated with HFpEF or the study is discontinued by the Sponsor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject participated in Study TDE-HF-301, remained on study drug, was compliant
             with study procedures and assessments during Study TDE-HF-301, and completed through
             Week 24 of that study.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  The subject is pregnant or lactating.

          -  The subject was prematurely discontinued from Study TDE-HF-301 for any reason.

          -  The subject developed a concurrent illness or condition during Study TDE HF 301,
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would represent a risk to the subject's
             overall health if they enrolled in this study.
