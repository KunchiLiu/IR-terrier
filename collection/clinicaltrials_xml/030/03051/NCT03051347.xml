      This is designated to validate patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures in itch-specific
      pediatric skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, and examine the ability of a modified
      stigma instrument to assess the severity and type of stigma experienced in atopic dermatitis
      and other potentially stigmatizing conditions.

      This study involves a series of research and development projects targeted at two of the
      most common chronic diseases affecting children: asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD, or
      eczema). The Investigators propose to directly validate patient-reported outcomes (PRO)
      measures in a large cohort of itch-specific pediatric skin conditions, with a primary focus
      on AD. The Investigators propose to examine the ability of PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information Systems) instruments to detect meaningful and clinically significant
      change in disease status, as well as to create a pediatric itch item pool and PRO model for
      signs and symptoms of skin disease. The Investigators will also examine the ability of a
      modified Neuro-QOL stigma instrument to assess the severity and type of stigma experienced
      in AD and across various dermatologic or other potentially stigmatizing conditions. Lurie
      Children's Hospital will only be involved in the AD and stigma portions of this project

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Affected children must have moderate to severe AD or another skin condition that
             causes itch, experience itch, understand English, and be able to complete an
             English-based survey

          -  Any child with a potentially disfiguring skin condition or change in appearance
             related to disease/intervention will be considered eligible. Parents of children with
             such conditions will also be asked to participate. Children and parents must also
             understand English and be able to complete an English-based survey
