      Each patient will participate for up to 62 weeks, which includes a Screening Period,
      followed by a Baseline Visit and open-label treatment for 1 year with a safety Follow-up 4
      weeks after the last treatment.

        -  Screening Period: up to 6 weeks.

        -  Open-Label Treatment Period: 52 weeks (1 year)
