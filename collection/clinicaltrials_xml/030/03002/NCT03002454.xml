  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A non-fission sourced, solvent generator produced 99mTc intravenous injection, as 99mTc
      -MDP, is to be used as a bone scan diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for assessment of bone
      pathology using the same oncologic indications as nuclear reactor sourced 99mTc, as
      99mTc-MDP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be a comparison of diagnostic and imaging equivalency of 99mTc
      Pertechnetate intravenous injection (labeled with commercial MDP kits) produced by a
      non-fission sourced/solvent generator and a nuclear reactor/column sourced generator. Each
      oncologic participant acts as their own control to reduce error variance.

      Condition Intervention Phase Oncologic indication for which a bone scan would normally be
      indicated. Participant having recently had a bone scan using Technetium (99mTc) Medronate
      Injection USP labeled with 99mTc derived from fission-sourced 99Mo. Drug: Technetium (99mTc)
      Medronate Injection USP labeled with 99mTc derived from neutron-activation-produced 99Mo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Oncology out-patients in whom an acceptable quality standard-of-care Technetium
             (99mTc) Medronate bone scan has been ordered or obtained within the last 28 days.

          -  If female of child-bearing potential is outside of the window of 10 days since the
             last menstrual period, a negative serum pregnancy test is required.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Oncology out-patients in whom an acceptable quality standard-of-care Technetium
             (99mTc) Medronate bone scan has been ordered or obtained within the last 28 days.

          -  If female of child-bearing potential is outside of the window of 10 days since the
             last menstrual period, a negative serum pregnancy test is required.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Identified interval events which have occurred after the standard of care bone scan
             but prior to the administration of non-fission sourced Technetium (99mTc) Medronate
             which could influence or change bone scan uptake (e.g. skeletal trauma, orthopedic
             surgery, bone infection, or interval therapy (i.e. radiation therapy, non-maintenance
             chemotherapy). -
