          3. Sustained platelet count ≤50,000/µL and/or sustained Hgb ≤8 g/dL, related to the
             nature of the graft.

          4. Stable donor cell chimerism.

          5. If the subject had allogeneic HCT for a malignant disease, the subject should have
             complete donor chimerism.

          6. ANC ≥1,000/mm3 at the time of screening.

          7. General performance status evaluated by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-2 scale.

          8. Signed written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of active malignancy at the time of HCT or at any time since the HCT.

          2. Other known etiology of the thrombocytopenia (such as infection, medication, etc.).

          3. Other known etiology of the anemia (such as blood loss, iron deficiency, etc.).

          4. Current active infection requiring systemic treatment.

          5. Acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) Grade III or IV, or severe chronic GvHD at the
             time of screening.

          6. Treatment with cytokines, including thrombopoietin, erythropoietin, granulocyte
             colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor
             (GM-CSF) in the last 4 weeks prior to treatment, or currently planned for the
             subject.

          7. Subject has received prophylactic treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI)
             within 6 months prior to treatment, or any other cell therapy within 3 months prior
             to treatment.

          8. History of malignancy (other than the disease that required the HCT) within 5 years
             prior to screening.

          9. History of significant transfusion reaction.

         10. Known allergies to any of the following: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), human serum
             albumin, bovine serum albumin, gentamicin, or antihistamine.

         11. History of allergic/hypersensitivity reaction to any substance having required
             hospitalization and/or treatment with intra-venous steroids/epinephrine.

         12. Medical history of human immunodeficiency virus or syphilis infection.

         13. Known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection at the time of screening.

         14. A pregnant or lactating woman or a woman who plans to become pregnant during the
             study.

         15. Serum Creatinine level &gt;2.5 mg/dL.

         16. Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (alanine aminotransferase), serum oxaloacetic
             pyruvic transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase) &gt;2.5 x upper limit of normal range.

         17. International normalized ration (INR) &gt;2 or subjects who are on oral anticoagulant
             therapy with INR &gt;2 unless anticoagulation treatment can be safely
             interrupted/discontinued around each investigational product (IP) treatment.

         18. Severe or uncontrolled/unstable cardiac, pulmonary, or renal disease, including
             myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within 3 months prior to treatment.

         19. History of solid organ transplantation.
