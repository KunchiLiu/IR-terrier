    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study are to determine if the Internet is a feasible and
      acceptable delivery method for cognitive-behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) in adults
      with asthma and comorbid insomnia; and to identify the need for asthma-related content using
      qualitative research methods (individual telephone interviews) that may be critical to the
      success of an Internet-based intervention in asthma patient populations.

    <description>Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi) is a self-guided, automated, interactive, and tailored web-based program modeled on the primary tenets of cognitive-behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I): sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, and relapse prevention. Intervention content is allocated out over time through 6 &quot;Cores.&quot; Users obtain access to a new Core based on a time and event-based schedule (e.g., 7 days after completion of previous Core). SHUTi uses online sleep diaries to track progress and to tailor treatment (e.g., assign a sleep restriction window).</description>
