        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of stage III (unresectable) or stage IV melanoma
             with at least 1 lesion that is measurable by RECIST 1.1 criteria and accessible for
             biopsies

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1

          -  Adequate hepatic function

          -  Adequate renal function

          -  Adequate bone marrow function

          -  Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

          -  Provide signed informed consent

          -  Able to understand and complete study-related questionnaires

          -  Anticipated life expectancy &gt;12 week

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk
             for immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

          -  Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the programmed death-1/ programmed
             death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1 pathway)

          -  Prior treatment with other immune modulating anti-cancer agents, except for remote
             treatment (&gt;6 months) in adjuvant setting.

          -  Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active.

          -  Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within
             4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria will apply
