  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to gauge the patients' level of comfort and anxiety for sequential cataract
      surgeries to assess if the second experience of cataract surgery differs from the initial
      experience.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient is scheduled to undergo two sequential cataract extractions under topical
      anesthesia with local anesthetic eye drops and minimal sedation- one on each eye. The
      surgeon, basic surgical procedure, anesthetic technique, and approximate length of procedure
      are reasonably similar and the patients act as their own control. Subjects in the study will
      answer very brief questions regarding anxiety and comfort about their surgery before and
      after each procedure, and on the day after their second surgery.

        Patients will be identified by their status presenting for surgery with one specific
        surgeon (A.T.) at the Eye and Ear Center at Gowdy Fields. Access will be through the
        preoperative anesthesia assessment performed by the attending anesthesiologist.
