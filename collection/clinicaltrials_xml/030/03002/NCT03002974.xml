  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how anakinra relieves pain for patients with acute
      gout that cannot take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine. The
      patients will be divided in different treatment groups to compare anakinra to the available
      drug triamcinolone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to treatment at their first gout flare in the study. The first
      treatment period will be followed by an extension period during which the patients will
      receive the same treatment for any subsequent flares within 52 weeks of randomization. Each
      new flare treated will initiate a new series of study visits and assessments according to
      specified schedule of events. Only if a patient experience a new flare after Day 15 of the
      latest flare they can start a new treatment period. The comparison of primary interest is
      between anakinra (100 mg and 200 mg combined) and 40 mg triamcinolone, and as a secondary
      objective the 2 different doses of anakinra will be evaluated as well as assessment for
      subsequent flares.
