  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most used airway management strategies are different types of supraglottic airway
      devices (SAD) for transurethral resection of bladder and ureteroscopy in urological surgery
      . Classical laryngeal mask airway (LMA-C) and I-Gel SADs are being used already. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of a new type of SAD the Baska Mask®
      with I-gel and LMA-C regarding their insertion times, durations, perioperative complications
      and effects on hemodynamic parameters, peak airway pressures (Paw) and airway plato
      pressures in urological surgery as well.

      The most used airway management strategies are different types of supraglottic airway
      devices (SAD) for transurethral resection of bladder and ureteroscopy in urological surgery
      . Classical laryngeal mask airway (LMA-C) and I-Gel SADs are being used already. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of a new type of SAD the Baska Mask®
      with I-gel and LMA-C regarding their insertion times, durations, perioperative complications
      and effects on hemodynamic parameters, peak airway pressures (Paw) and airway plato
      pressures in urological surgery as well.

      The main suggestion about the Baska Mask® is that it's the most appropriate airway device
      with high Paws. In high Paws, higher air leaks may occur from the sides of cuff and this
      causes hypoventilation. So the main aim of this study is to evaluate and compare effects of
      three types -I-gel, ,the Baska Mask® LMA-C- of SADs regarding their effects on Paw, Airway
      plato pressures, Tidal volume, air leak volumes.

      The secondary aim was to observe and compare their effects on hemodynamic
      parameters,insertion times, ease of insertion and perioperative complications.
