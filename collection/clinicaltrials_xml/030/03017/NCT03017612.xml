      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Raindrop Near
      Vision Inlay implanted in bilateral pseudophakes with presbyopia for improvement of near and
      intermediate vision. The ReVision Optics corneal inlay is a 2.0-mm, 30-micron inlay made of
      a hydrogel material, implanted under a lasik flap. Subjects must require reading add from
      +1.50 D to +2.50 D. Subjects must have a preoperative manifest refraction spherical
      equivalent of -0.50 to +1.00 D with no more than 0.75 D of refractive cylinder. The Raindrop
      Near Vision Inlay will be implanted in the non-dominant eye.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presbyopia is a natural outcome of pseudophakic subjects with monofocal or toric intraocular
      lenses. Treatment of pseudophakic presbyopia generally consists of reading glasses, contact
      lenses, or monovision LASIK, which allows the patient to see near objects. All these options
      suffer limitations from the patient perspective. For example, reading glasses can easily be
      lost or not conveniently available. Multifocal contact lenses suffer from visual symptoms
      and instability due to potential rotation and movement of the contact lenses on the surface
      of the cornea. And, successful monovision is generally limited to patients with a history of
      successful use of contact lenses for monovision, and even in these eyes, monovision is
      associated with a substantial decrease in stereo acuity and contrast sensitivity.

      ReVision Optics has developed the Raindrop Near Vision Inlay for the correction of near and
      intermediate vision. The inlay is the same refractive index as the human cornea. The inlay
      is placed in the non-dominant eye, centered over the pupil after a corneal flap (LASIK) has
      been made. The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay is expected to provide low induction of visual
      symptoms and improvement of near and intermediate vision in emmetropic subjects with
      presbyopia. This technology may also demonstrate potential clinical utility in bilateral
      pseudophakic subjects.
