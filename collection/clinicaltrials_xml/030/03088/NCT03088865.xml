  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implementation of the initial specimen diversion technique, in which the first milliliter of
      the venipuncture sample is not injected into the culture bottle, led to a significant
      reduction in blood culture contamination rates. This technique is based on the assumption
      that the skin plug aspirated during venipuncture is a major source of contaminating
      bacteria. One such diversion method is aspirating the first blood volume into a blood
      collection tube. It has, however, been suggested that regular blood collection tubes carry
      contaminants from the tube's stopper into the blood cultures drawn afterwards, thereby
      increasing contamination rates. The aim of this trial is to examine the effect of aspirating
      the first blood volume into a regular blood collection tube on blood culture contamination
      rate.
