  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase 3 comparative study to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of irinotecan liposome injection compared to topotecan (IV) in patients with small
      cell lung cancer who have progressed on or after platinum-based first-line therapy.

      The study will be conducted in two parts:

      1a. dose determination of irinotecan liposome injection

      1b. preliminary safety and efficacy

      2. a randomized, efficacy study of irinotecan liposome injection versus topotecan

      The study will be conducted in two parts:

      Part 1 (1a and 1b):

      Part 1a: Open-label dose finding study of irinotecan liposome injection . Approximately 12
      patients will be enrolled

      Part 1a Objectives:

        -  Describe the safety and tolerability of irinotecan liposome injection monotherapy
           administered every 2 weeks

        -  Determine the irinotecan liposome injection monotherapy dose for Part 1b and Part 2 of
           this study

      Part 1b:

      Open-label parallel study of irinotecan liposome injection and IV topotecan. Approximately
      50 patients will be enrolled

      Part 1b Objectives:

      Describe the following for the treatment arms (irinotecan liposome injection and IV
      topotecan):

        -  Progression free survival rate at 12 weeks

        -  Objective response rate (ORR)

        -  Progression free survival (PFS)

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Safety profile

      Part 2:

      A randomized, efficacy study of irinotecan liposome injection versus IV topotecan.

      Approximately 420 patients will be enrolled in part 2.
