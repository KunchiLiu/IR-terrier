             NSCLC with stage IIIB or stage IV disease who received no prior systemic treatment
             for recurrent or metastatic NSCLC

          2. Archival or newly obtained formalin-fixed tumor tissue from a metastatic/recurrent
             site, which has not previously been irradiated

          3. Tumor cells expressing PD L1 above a specific percentage of tumor cells by IHC
             performed by the central laboratory

          4. At least 1 radiographically measureable lesion per RECIST 1.1

         16. Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks prior to first dose

         17. Documented allergic or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to antibody
             treatments

         18. Known allergy to doxycycline or other tetracycline antibiotics

         19. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with participation
