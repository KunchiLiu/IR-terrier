        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:

             NSCLC with stage IIIB or stage IV disease who received no prior systemic treatment
             for recurrent or metastatic NSCLC

          2. Archival or newly obtained formalin-fixed tumor tissue from a metastatic/recurrent
             site, which has not previously been irradiated

          3. Tumor cells expressing PD L1 above a specific percentage of tumor cells by IHC
             performed by the central laboratory

          4. At least 1 radiographically measureable lesion per RECIST 1.1

         16. Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks prior to first dose

         17. Documented allergic or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to antibody
             treatments

         18. Known allergy to doxycycline or other tetracycline antibiotics
