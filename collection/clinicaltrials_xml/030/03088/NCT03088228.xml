      Background: To evaluate the association between maternal periodontal status and
      preeclampsia, as well as the correlation of these two disorders with maternal gingival
      crevicular fluid levels of interleukin (IL)-6, interleukin-35 (IL-35) and interleukin-37
      (IL-37). The investigators also investigated their relation to the severity of preeclampsia.

      Methods: Twenty-nine healthy pregnant, 30 mild preeclamptic and 23 severe preeclamptic women
      were recruited to the study. All of the periodontological measurements and gingival
      crevicular fluid samples were obtained in the first day of puerperium during
      hospitalization. The obstetric and neonatal outcomes of the patients were retrieved from the
      medical records.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study population included 92 postpartum women aged between 18 and 45 years who
             were delivered at our referral obstetric center between 25 and 40 weeks of gestation.
             The patients were divided into three groups as, healthy controls, mild and severe
             preeclamptic postpartum women.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with accompanying diseases, multiple gestations, and congenital
             abnormalities were excluded from the study.
