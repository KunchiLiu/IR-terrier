    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to prove non-inferiority of thermal ablation compared to hepatic
      resection in patients with at least one resectable and ablatable colorectal liver metastases
      (≤3cm) and no extrahepatic disease.

      Study design:

      COLLISION is a single-blind prospective multi-center phase-III randomized controlled trial.
      We hypothesize that thermal ablation is non-inferior to surgery for the selected patient
      groups in terms of the primary objective (overall survival). The Cox proportional hazards
      model (1-sided; non-inferiority or superiority) is used for sample size calculations. Given
      the superior safety profile we consider a hazard ratio of 1.3 to represent the upper limit
      of non-inferiority (non-inferiority margin). An HR of 1.3 corresponds to a 56.5% chance of
      the ablated patients to die first ((P = HR/(1 + HR) = 1.3/(1 + 1.3) = 0.565 (56.5%)). With 3
      years of patient accrual and five years of follow-up we will have reached 60% of events
      (death) in approximately 6.5 years (overall probability of event, pE =0.6). The calculated
      sample size therefore is 599 (NS).To account for a 10% drop-out ratio (NDO=69) prior to
      randomization and a 3% loss to follow-up (NLTFU=18) after randomization we need to include
      687 patients (NI). A total number of 618 patients will be randomized (NR) into one of two
      arms: arm A will undergo surgical resection (n=309) and arm B thermal ablation (n=309) for
      appointed target lesions.

      Study population:

      Patients with ≥1 resectable and ablatable CRLM (≤3cm), no extrahepatic disease, a good
      performance status (WHO 0-2) and a low-risk clinical risk score (CRS 0-2) are considered
      eligible. Supplementary resections for resectable lesions &gt;3cm and thermal ablations for
      unresectable CRLM ≤3cm are allowed with a maximum number of CRLM of 10.

      Intervention:

      Eligible patients will be stratified into low-, intermediate- and high disease burden after
      assessment by an expert panel. The panel, consisting of at least two diagnostic
      radiologists, two interventional radiologists and two hepatobiliary and/or oncological
      surgeons, will appoint lesions that are resectable and ablatable as target lesions,
      resectable and unablatable lesions as unablatable lesions and ablatable but unresectable
      lesions as unresectable lesions. All unablatable lesions should be resectable and all
      unresectable lesions should be ≤3cm and ablatable.

      With the exception of patients that are suitable for laparoscopic resection or percutaneous
      ablation (low disease burden), eligibility needs to be reconfirmed during the surgical
      procedure. Hereafter patients will be randomized to undergo surgical resection of the target
      lesions (allowing thermal ablation for additional unresectable lesions) or thermal ablation
      (allowing resection for additional unablatable lesions). Patients will remain unaware of the
      appointed treatment arm and the actual treatment of their target lesions (single-blind).
      Postprocedural care will be identical between the two groups with the exemption that hepatic
      recurrences (either local site recurrence or new lesions) suitable for both resection and
      ablation will again be treated with the technique used to treat the initial target
      lesion(s). Conferring to national guidelines follow-up will include contrast-enhanced (ce)
      CT scans, 18F-FDG-PET-CT scans, laboratory tests including tumor markers (CEA) and quality
      of life questionnaires. Patients with recurrences that are considered unsuitable for
      additional focal therapy will be re-referred to their medical oncologist to assess
      additional systemic chemotherapy. In the event of chemotherapeutic down-staging hereafter,
      focal therapy can be reconsidered.
