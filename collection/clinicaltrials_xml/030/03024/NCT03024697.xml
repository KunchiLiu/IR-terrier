    <textblock>
      In this proposed study, the investigators are looking to conduct a prospective, randomised,
      double-blind, non-inferiority trial, to study single-shot pectoral plane (PECs) blocks
      versus continuous local anaesthetic infusion analgesia versus a combination of PECs blocks
      and local anaesthetic infusion analgesia, when it comes to providing analgesia for most
      forms of breast surgery.

      Breast surgery is common, and the optimal form of analgesia is currently unknown. Techniques
      involving local anaesthetic, such as pectoral plane (PECs) blocks and infusion pumps, are
      growing in popularity, as they reduce the amount of opioid medications used. Opioids are
      associated with nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, drowsiness and constipation, and as
      such, opioid-sparing analgesic regimens postoperatively are becoming more common. These
      regimens will typically involve paracetamol, a NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug),
      and a local anaesthetic technique.

      Pectoral plane blocks involve a once-off injection of local anaesthetic at two locations
      within the chest wall, typically done after the patient undergoes general anaesthesia, but
      before the commencement of surgery. Local anaesthetic infusion pumps involve the insertion
      of a catheter into the wound at the end of surgery, before the patient emerges from general
      anaesthesia, that constantly emit local anaesthetic over a defined period of time. Each
      technique is considered extremely safe, and is considered acceptable as a form of pain
      relief in patients undergoing breast surgery.

      There are no published works comparing pectoral plane blocks with local anaesthetic infusion
      pump analgesia, and the investigators see a gap in the knowledge base that can be addressed.
      This study will allow efficacy, safety and cost of the three techniques to be compared. The
      investigators feel the study design is robust, and statistical analysis based on previously
      published works in the area of postoperative analgesia has allowed the study to be powered
      appropriately.

      Patients undergoing breast surgery are a vulnerable group, and this is recognised via the
      provision of a comprehensive Patient Information Leaflet and a commitment to respecting the
      process of Informed Consent. The investigators also recognise this is a stressful period in
      a woman's life, and the study will be conducted in a sensitive and compassionate manner.

      The study has been designed to be prospective, randomised, and double-blinded. The
      anaesthetic will be standardised in relation to analgesic and anti-emetic agents
      administered, in order to minimise variables. Chronic post-surgical pain is a growing area
      of research, and the follow-up telephone interview at 3-months will allow investigation of
      this.

      A Data Record Form will be utilised for data collection, which will subsequently be analysed
      statistically. Data will be handled sensitively, securely, and by the minimum number of
      researchers. A plan is in place for destruction of data at an appropriate time.

      While there will be no direct benefit to participants, including monetary considerations,
      this research study will add to the knowledge-base surrounding analgesia for breast surgery.

      Title; Single-shot pectoral plane(PECs) block versus continuous local anaesthetic infusion
      analgesia or both PECs block and local anaesthetic infusion after breast surgery: A
      randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial.

      Background &amp; Rationale; Pectoral Plane blocks (PECs) blocks I and II for chest wall
      anaesthesia and analgesia have recently been described and seem to be gaining in popularity.
      PECs blocks provide superior analgesia compared with placebo, and therefore reduce the need
      for opioid analgesia and related side-effects such as postoperative nausea and vomiting.
      However, there is a dearth of evidence based research for their efficacy, safety and cost
      compared with other effective, established chest wall analgesic techniques, such as
      paravertebral and local anaesthetic (LA) infusion pump analgesia. Therefore, the
      investigators propose a prospective, randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial to
      compare single shot PECs block versus continuous local anaesthetic pump analgesia versus
      combined PECs block and local anaesthetic pump analgesia.

      Objectives &amp; Endpoints; Primary End-Point: Area under curve of NRS (numerical rating score)
      pain score versus time, where NRS (on moving: sitting up in bed) are recorded at the
      following time points after surgery: 1 hr, 2-4 hr, 6-8 hr, 10-14 hr 20-24 hr.

      Secondary end-points: Opioid consumption ovr 24 hr; Postoperative nausea, postoperative
      vomiting, sedation score, postural hypotension, estimated cost per patient. Chronic
      persistent breast pain at 3 months by telephone interview using Short Form McGill
      questionnaire.

      Inclusion &amp; Exclusion criteria - Covered in another section

      Methodology - Covered in another section

      Treatment of Study Subjects; Apart from the described interventions, no changes will be made
      to routine care for patients attending the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH)
      for breast surgery

      Safety Reporting; As each described intervention is a recognised technique for the provision
      of analgesia for patients undergoing breast surgery, no additional safety reporting measures
      will need to be put in place. Standard reporting of issues includes informing the
      supervising anaesthetist of pump malfunction, NRS pain score &gt;4, signs of local anaesthetic
      toxicity and derangement of normal physiological parameters.

      Proposed Statistical Analysis; Taking a NRS difference at any time point of 2 as being
      clinically important, studies based on opioid analgesia after breast surgery indicate a
      standard deviation (SD) of 2.5 as a reasonable median SD among NRS values in the early
      postoperative period. Therefore, taking a Type I error of 0.05 and a Type II error of 0.1,
      n=17 patients each group would be required to demonstrate this difference with 90% power. To
      allow for logistical difficulties in patient follow up, we propose to enrol n=20 patients in
      each arm of the study. Data will be inspected for distribution. Normally distributed data
      will be compared using unpaired independent sample t-test; non-parametric data will be
      compared using Mann Whitney or Kruskal Wallis test as appropriate.

      Data Handling:

      Data will be accessible by researchers only. Hard copy data will be recorded via means of a
      Data Record Form, which will subsequently be transferred to electronic format. Data will be
      coded in order to allow for double-blinding, and for patients to have the opportunity to
      withdraw consent to participate at any stage. The key to re-identify the data will be held
      by a secure third-party, and will not be released until all data analysis has been
      completed. Electronic data will be coded and stored in encrypted form on a password
      protected hospital computer, which is located in a locked office. Hard copy data will be
      coded and stored in a secure folder in a locked filing cabinet, which is located in a locked
      office. Data will not leave the site of origin at any stage.

      Retention of Essential Documents; Coded data will be retained for the purposes of oral
      presentation and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. It will be retained for a period of
      time necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, after which point it will
      be destroyed. Data is strictly confidential, and will not be shared with third parties.
