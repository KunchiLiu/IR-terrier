  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of BonoFill-II
      as an autologous bone-regenerating graft in the reconstruction of deficient bone in two
      clinical indications:

        1. Long bone extra-articular comminuted fracture

        2. Large bone defect or gap incapable of self-regeneration
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Primary Endpoint:

      To establish that the transplantation of BonoFill-II into bone defect/gap is safe under the
      following conditions:

        -  No treatment-related appearance of heterotrophic bone ossification

        -  No excessive bone formation at the transplantation sites

        -  No abnormalities in the treated sites

      Secondary Endpoint:

      To establish that the transplantation of BonoFill-II into bone defect/gap is effective under
      the following conditions:

        1. Long bone extraarticular comminuted fracture:

           - Enhancement of fracture healing is considerably faster than the common time period
           known for these clinical conditions in at least two thirds of the treated subjects.

        2. Large bone defect or gap incapable of self-regeneration:

             -  A newly formed bone tissue is generated within the bone gap which re-establishes
                bone continuity in at least two thirds of the treated subjects.
