  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators goal was to study the effect of high flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) on
      the rate of post-operative pulmonary complications in thoracic surgical patients. The
      Investigators hypothesis is that prophylactic HFNC oxygen, as compared to standard oxygen
      treatment, will reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, improve
      post-operative pulmonary function, and reduce ICU and hospital length of stay.

    <description>The primary outcome &quot;post-operative pulmonary complication&quot; is defined as present if any one of the following criteria are met:
SpO2 &lt; 90% with FiO2 ≥ 50%
Dyspnea at rest
Respiratory rate &gt; 25 breaths/min
Active use of accessory respiratory muscles
PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 200
Escalation of therapy to non-invasive ventilation
Re-intubation
Occurrence of hospital-acquired pneumonia
Re-admission to the ICU</description>

    <description>The intervention group received HHFNC O2 at a set flow of 40L/min. FiO2 was titrated by respiratory therapists to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90%. The HHFNC O2 apparatus included: 1) Air-Oxygen blender - capable of delivering 21-100% FiO2 at flow rates up to 60L/min, 2) Heated Humidifier - providing active heating and humidification to the delivered air-O2 blend, 3) Nasal cannula - larger diameter, slightly elongated nasal cannula with single limb connection to humidifier</description>
