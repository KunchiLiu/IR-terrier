      In addition to axillary lymph node (ALN), internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) chain is also
      the first-echelon nodal drainage site for metastasis and it provides important prognostic
      information in breast cancer patients. However, decision about local treatment of IMLN is
      still being made based on ALN status. The 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network
      Guidelines recommend internal mammary lymph node irradiation for patients with more than 4
      positive ALNs (category 1), and strongly consider irradiation for patients with 1 to 3
      positive ALNs (category 2A). Therefore, there will be patients in positive ALN subgroup who
      just face complications of an unnecessary radiation to IMLN and there will be patients in
      negative ALN subgroup who do not receive adjuvant radiation therapy they really need. Thus,
      these inclusion criteria of National Comprehensive Cancer Network might lead to
      over-treatment and under-treatment. Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB)
      provides a less invasive method of assessing the IMLN than surgical dissection. However, low
      visualization rate of IM-SLN has been a restriction of IM-SLNB. A modified radiotracer
      injection technique was established in our previous study. This technique could
      significantly improve the IM-SLN detection rate. The investigators have validated the
      accurate of the hypothesis and the modified radiotracer injection technique in the previous
      study.

      Recently, the investigators propose that if IM-SLN is the only metastatic lymph node and
      there would be no positive node else in IMLN chain, the radiotherapy and its associated
      complications could be avoided in these patients. On the other hand, if there is the
      presence of metastatic non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) in IMLN chain after IM-SLNB, it is
      important to predict the risk of IM-NSLN metastasis in IM-SLN positive patients. As there is
      currently no such model, a predictive model for IM-SLN positive patients to avoid
      radiotherapy is needed in this situation. Therefore, a new study will be conducted to verify
      the issues above.

      In the current study, all the participants (18~70 years of age) would have the preoperative
      pathology of invasive breast cancer and positive fine-needle aspiration result in their
      clinical or ultrasonic suspicious axillary lymph node. 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid was
      injected into the parenchyma under the ultrasound guidance 3 to 18 hours before surgery. Two
      syringes of 9.25 to 18.5MBq 99mTc-labeled sulfur colloid in 0.5 to 0.7mL volume were
      injected at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions 0.5 to 1.0 cm from areola (about 2.0~4.0 cm from
      the nipple). IM-SLNB was performed in all participants with IMSLN visualized on preoperative
      lymphoscintigraphy and/or detected by the intra-operative gamma probe. All hotspots in the
      internal mammary basin were harvested and intra-operative identification of the IM-SLN was
      based on gamma probe detection. The IM-SLN was sectioned along the long axis into two blocks
      and all blocks were tested by the frozen section and the touch imprint cytology
      intra-operatively. Those participants with positive intra-operative results received IMLN
      dissection. Finally, all the IM-SLN blocks and IM-NSLN dissected were assessed
      post-operatively by H&amp;E and Cytokeratin 19 stained immunohistochemistry. The conclusion
      would be drawn through the results mentioned above.
