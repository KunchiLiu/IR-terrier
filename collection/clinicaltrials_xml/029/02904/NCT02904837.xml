    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative nervous system disease that causes,
      among other changes, movement disorders that lead to loss of motor skills, especially in
      gait. The use of mental practice (MP) as a method for the acquisition and improvement of
      motor skills is well evidenced in the literature for healthy individuals and stroke
      patients, but there is still insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of this method in
      PD gait improvement. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of MP combined
      with physical practice(PP) for gait training guided by cognitive strategies in patients with
      PD.

      Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative nervous system disease
      that causes, among other changes, movement disorders that lead to loss of motor skills,
      especially in gait. The use of mental practice (MP) as a method for the acquisition and
      improvement of motor skills is well evidenced in the literature for healthy individuals and
      stroke patients. However, there is still insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of this
      method in PD gait improvement, as there is limited availability in MP training protocols
      literature for this purpose for this population.

      Objectives: To verify the efficiency and to evaluate the effects of a protocol based on
      mental practice combined with physical practice for gait training guided by cognitive
      strategies in patients with PD.

      Design: Parallel prospective, single blind, randomized clinical trial.

      Setting: Brazilian Parkinson Association.

      Participants: Seventy-five patients with PD in stages 2-3 of disease evolution according to
      Hoehn and Yahr Classification.

      Interventions: The Mental Practice training (MPT) consisted of ten gait training sessions,
      twice a week, for five weeks, using mental practice training associated with physical
      practice guided by cognitive strategies; the Physical Practice training (PPT) consisted of
      similar gait training as MPT, guided by cognitive strategies, but without mental practice.
      The Control training (CT) consisted of similar gait training as PPT, but without the support
      of any compensatory strategy.

      Primary outcome measure: Gait performance scored by the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) and
      Six-minute Walk Test (6MWT).

      Secondary outcome measure: Gait performance in terms of spatial-temporal variables (speed,
      cadence, step length).

      Randomization: Participants were randomized by ClinStat software into one of three groups:
      Mental Practice Group (MPG), which performed the MPT; Physical Practice Group (PPG), which
      performed the PPT; and Control Group (CG), which performed the CT.

      Statistical analysis: Gait performance in DGI, 6MWT and spatial-temporal variables before
      and after 10 training sessions, and after 30 and 60 days subsequent to the end of training
      were compared for MPG, PPG and CG using Repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA).

    <description>The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) was developed as a clinical tool to assess gait, balance and fall risk. It evaluates not only usual steady-state walking, but also walking during more challenging tasks. Eight functional walking tests are performed by the subject and marked out of three according to the lowest category which applies. Twenty-four is the total individual score possible. Scores of nineteen or less have been related to increase incidence of falls.</description>

    <measure>Six-minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>up tp 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test (6MWT) provides information regarding functional capacity, response to therapy and prognosis across a range of chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. The 6MWT measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The individual is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway. A distance less than 350 m is associated with increased mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure and pulmonary arterial hypertension.</description>

    <measure>Gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed is a quick, inexpensive, reliable measure of functional capacity with well-documented predictive value for major health-related outcomes. The individual is instructed to walk (in a preferred walking speed) a set time of 1 minute. Distance is measured while the individual walks the set time. The distance covered is divided by the time of 1 minute.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait cadence</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cadence is a walking rate, measured by the number of steps a person takes per minute. The natural cadence is about 120 steps/minute. To measure it, the individual is instructed to walk (in a preferred walking speed) a set time of 1 minute. The number of steps taken during this time is measured by a pedometer ou researcher's counting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Step length</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Step length is the distance between the heel strike of one foot and the heel strike of the opposite foot as a person walks. It s influenced by many factors, including gender and bone length. To measure it, the individual is instructed to walk (in a preferred walking speed) a set time of 1 minute. Distance and number of steps are measured while the individual walks the set time. Step lenght is calculated by dividing the total distance by the number of steps taken.</description>
