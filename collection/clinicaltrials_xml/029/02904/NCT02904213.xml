      The trial is a bridging Study to evaluate safety of pentavalent vaccine ComBe Five (Liquid)
      made in India, in healthy Vietnamese children aged from 8 - 10 weeks as a 3-dose series,
      interval for each dose is 4 weeks. 330 subjects will be enrolled in Binh Luc and Ly Nhan
      district, Ha Nam province. These subjects will be received 3 doses (0.5ml/dose) ComBe Five
      (Liquid), the first dose will be administered at 8-10 weeks of age.

      The frequency, rate and severity of immediate adverse events within 30 minutes after
      vaccination, solicited and unsolicited AE within 28 days after vaccination, the frequency
      and rate of SAE within 28 days after the first vaccination will be recorded as evidences for
      ComBeFive (Liquid) safety assessment. The subjects to be included from this trial would be
      representative of the population of Vietnam.

      The protocol has been reviewed and approved by Vietnam Military Medical University IRB and
