  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect and compare information on how and when adolescent
      heart transplant recipients take their prescribed medication. The investigators want to find
      out if regular use of 'an app' on cell phones, called the Teen Pocket PATH (TPP), can help
      adolescents take their medication according to their prescribed dosing schedule. This may
      then help reduce complications of transplant, such as rejection. The investigators also want
      to find out if how adolescent heart transplant recipients take their medications affects the
      development of antibodies in their blood. Antibodies are small proteins in the blood that
      may develop after heart transplantation, and which can sometimes damage a new heart.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Enrolled (consented) prior to hospital discharge from heart transplantation or within
             one month after discharge, but not later than 3 months post-transplantation;

          2. English as primary language or fluent in English;

          3. Informed consent and assent obtained;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Positive donor-specific cytotoxicity requiring different immunosuppressive regimen
             from standard care;

          2. Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or
             comply with study protocol;

          3. Re-transplant or multi-organ transplant recipient;

          4. Condition or characteristic which in the opinion of the investigator makes the
             participant unlikely to complete at least one year of follow-up;

          5. Current participation in other research studies that would, or might, interfere with
             the scientific integrity or safety of current study (e.g. by interference with
             immunosuppression management guidelines and study end-points).
