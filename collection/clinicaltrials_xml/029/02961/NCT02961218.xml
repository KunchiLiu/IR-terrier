        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects ages 12-20 years of age (both inclusive) diagnosed with
             sickle cell anemia (HbSS) or sickle beta0 thalassemia (documented by family studies,
             or analysis of either hemoglobin or DNA).

          -  Patient's written informed consent from those ≥18 years of age must be obtained
             before any assessment is performed. Parent or legal guardian's written informed
             consent and child's assent, if appropriate, are required before any assessment is
             performed for patients &lt; 18 years of age.

          -  Detectable baseline of background or episodic pain measured by daily e-diary over 1
             to 2 weeks during screening period as defined below: Average daily pain score ≥ 1 cm
             without analgesic use over a period of at least 7 days and/or, At least one episode
             of pain requiring analgesic use during a period of up to 14 days.

          -  History of ≥3 vaso-occlusive pain episodes in the past year, as defined as pain with
             no other, non-sickle cell identifiable cause that requires analgesia and interferes
             with activities of daily living for more than 2h.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of known hypersensitivity to canakinumab.

          -  Ongoing or treatment with the past 2 years with red blood cell transfusion therapy,
             or have evidence of iron overload requiring chelation therapy.

          -  Transcranial Doppler ultrasound in the past year demonstrating velocity in middle or
             anterior cerebral or internal carotid artery y ≥200 cm/sec.

          -  Administration of any other blood products within 3 weeks of screening visit.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
