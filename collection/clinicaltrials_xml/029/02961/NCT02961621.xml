  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergency call centers across the country are preparing for the Next Generation 911 (NG911)
      initiative, which will allow citizens to place 9-1-1 &quot;calls&quot; using digital technologies such
      as text messaging, email, Skype or instant messaging, and will expand emergency information
      sources to also include streaming video, photo uploads, and automatic crash notifications.
      The impact of these new information and communication technologies on those tasked with
      using them in time-sensitive emergency situations is unknown. Our study is designed to
      address the following hypotheses: 1) We hypothesize that NG911 implementation will have a
      significant effect on telecommunicator stress levels and 2) A resiliency training tailored
      to the needs of telecommunicators will mitigate the impact on NG911 implementation on stress
      levels. We will test these hypotheses through the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: Measure levels of stress, job satisfaction and job performance among 9-1-1
      telecommunicators before and after the NG911 implementation.

      Aim 2: Develop and test the efficacy of an evidence-based resiliency training and worker
      support intervention to improve psychological well-being and job performance of 9-1-1
      telecommunicators.

      Aim 3: Build an ABM tool of 9-1-1 call centers to improve 9-1-1 telecommunicator workforce
      training and smooth transitions to future call center innovations.
