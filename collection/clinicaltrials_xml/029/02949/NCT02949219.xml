  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with small
      bowel adenocarcinoma that has spread to other places in the body or that cannot be removed
      by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether pembrolizumab administered to small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA)
      patients demonstrates antitumor activity as measured by the confirmed response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess survival endpoints (overall survival [OS], progression free survival [PFS]),
      including stratified analysis by tumor site.

      II. To assess whether pembrolizumab is safe in SBA patients by assessing adverse events.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether PD-L1 expression, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC), or
      microsatellite instability (MSI) status is associated with the response rate overall.

      II. To determine if Bim levels in tumor-reactive CD11ahighPD-1+CD8+ peripheral blood T cells
      can objectively monitor responses to pembrolizumab and to determine if excessive release of
      soluble B7-H1 (soluble [s]PD-L1) by the tumor leads to Bim upregulation and treatment
      resistance in SBA.

      III. To determine if other tissue-based factors, such as total mutational burden, correlate
      with response to pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months, and then every
      6 months for up to 5 years.

These correlations will be done using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical data and Kaplan-Meier methods (including the log-rank test) for the survival endpoints. Univariate Cox regression models will also be done to assess for marker effects on survival endpoints. Descriptive statistics and graphical methods will be used to summarize the data as well. All these analyses will be done overall and by MMR/MSI status. The following protein biomarkers will be assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tumor samples obtained at baseline: 1) MMR (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2), 2) PDL1 staining, and 3) Lymphocyte-specific markers (CD4, CD8, Bim, etc.)</description>
