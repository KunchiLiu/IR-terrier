      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide treatment of
      children with short bowel syndrome (SBS) who completed the TED-C13-003 study over a
      long-term period. It will evaluate how these children fared after the TED-C13-003 study
      ended. This study will also offer teduglutide treatment to eligible subjects, regardless of
      treatment received in TED-C13-003.
