    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the use of lung ultrasound compared to chest x-ray to
      diagnose pneumonia in Nepal. Given the ease, portability, and relative ease of teaching
      ultrasound, this would be potential technology available for many clinicians throughout
      Nepal to use for adult and pediatric patients presenting with suspected pneumonia. This
      would be especially useful in remote areas where clinicians have limited access to x-rays.
      Despite its utility, use of ultrasound to diagnose pneumonia in resource-limited settings
      like Nepal has not yet been studied. Therefore, this study is designed as a prospective,
      clinical diagnostic study to evaluate patients presenting with suspected pneumonia using
      diagnostic imaging of beside ultrasound compared with chest x-ray using computed tomography
      as the gold standard for diagnosis of pneumonia.

      Study Design: A prospective, convenience sample of participants presenting with suspected
      pneumonia when trained ultrasound investigator is present in the Patan Hospital Emergency
      Department will be performed in Patan, Nepal. This study will be done in partnership with
      Patan Hospital Emergency Department and with the approval of Nepal Health Research Council
      and Patan Hospital's ethical review committee.

      Study Setting: Located in the Kathmandu valley, Patan Hospital is a large urban hospital
      with 35-bed Emergency Department that sees approximately 32,000 patients per year.

      Study Protocol:

      Prior to the enrolling patients, investigators in the Emergency Department will save lung
      ultrasound exams and interpret the exams. These exams will then be independently reviewed by
      an ultrasonographer to ensure adequate skill in lung ultrasonography. A kappa analysis of
      these scans will be performed. If kappa &lt;0.6, we will review lung ultrasound with these
      investigators and repeat above evaluation until kappa of 0.6 is achieved.

      For participants meeting inclusion criteria, consent will be obtained from the participant.
      Consent will include explanation of use of bedside ultrasound and chest CT scan for
      diagnosis of their condition. This consent will also include explanation of risks and
      benefits in Nepali. These examinations will be provided free of charge to the participant.

      The investigator will record patient demographics, symptoms, lung exam findings, and
      pre-test probability of pneumonia (low, intermediate, high) on the data form.

      After initial clinical evaluation, a bedside lung ultrasound will be performed. A Sonosite M
      Turbo (Fujifilm Sonosite, Inc.) ultrasound machine will be used. The ultrasound examination
      will include ten views, two anterior views, two lateral views (one including the
      costophrenic angle), and one posterior view on both chest walls. The investigator will then
      record findings and diagnosis on the data entry form along with their post-test probability
      of pneumonia (low, intermediate, high).

      Participants will get a chest x-ray as a part of the standard evaluation. These readings
      will be recorded on the data sheet. Participants will then undergo a chest computed
      tomography (CT), as the diagnostic standard to evaluate for pneumonia. The chest x-ray and
      chest CT will be read by a radiologist. The radiologist will be blinded to the results of
      the previous studies. The reading and diagnosis according to CT will be recorded on the data
      form.

      Statistical Analysis

      The performance of ultrasound for diagnosis of pneumonia will be expressed as sensitivity,
      specificity, and likelihood ratios. Since the sensitivity of ultrasound is estimated around
      90%, in order to detect a 20% difference based on a CXR sensitivity of 70%, 62 patients will
      be needed. McNemar's test will be used to evaluate any statistical difference in sensitivity
      between CXR and US.
