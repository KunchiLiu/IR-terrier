  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dallas 2K is a 5-year natural history, longitudinal, prospective study of a cohort of
      2,000 participants that will help uncover the socio-demographic, lifestyle, clinical,
      psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to anti-depressant treatment
      response: remission, recurrence, relapse and individual outcomes in depressive disorders.
      Hence, the expected duration of this study is 10 years in length. Since this is an
      observational study, investigators will explore a comprehensive panel of carefully selected
      participant specific parameters: socio-demographic (age, ethnicity, economic); lifestyle
      (physical activity, substance use); clinical (medical history, anxious depression, early
      life trauma), biological (biomarkers in blood, saliva, urine), behavioral (cognitive,
      emotional), neurophysiological (EEG), and neuroimaging (structural, functional brain
      circuitry) with the goal to develop the most robust predictive models of treatment response
      and of depression outcomes. There is no medication or non-medication treatment or
      intervention provided by this study.

      Subjects will have elevated symptomatology of nonpsychotic chronic or recurrent depressive
      disorder and will be currently receiving or will be prescribed standard of care medication
      or non-medication based treatments by their providers/clinicians. The study cohort will
      reflect the wide range of patients seen in typical primary or psychiatric care settings, and
      may include unipolar or bipolar disorders and dysthymia (a more chronic form of depression).
      The cohort will be broadly representative of and generalizable to the US general population
      as a whole.

      Participants will be recruited from the UT Southwestern Depression Cohort, a registry of
      volunteers who have consented to learn more about participation in depression-related
      research studies -(IRB STU: 092015-049). Participants external to the Depression Cohort will
      first be consented and enrolled in the Depression Cohort before being consented and enrolled
      in the Dallas 2K study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, natural history, non-treatment, longitudinal cohort study.
      Participants will be receiving standard of care treatment for depression and other
      comorbidities from their treating clinician and will be allowed to continue such treatments
      in this study. There are no experimental study procedures, other than methods used for data
      capture (questionnaires, blood collection, EEG and MRI). Participants will be expected to
      visit study site (s) for repeated collection of data (assessments, biospecimens, and imaging
      procedures), up to 4 times a year for 5 years. A reduced battery of tests is allowable if
      subject is not able or willing to complete the full battery after the baseline visit.

      2000 research participants will be enrolled and followed over an eight-year period (each
      participant will be followed for 5-years) with collection of clinical and depression
      measurement assessments, measurement of vital signs, collection of biospecimens for
      biochemical and genetic analyses, electroencephalogram (EEG) with behavioral assessments,
      and neuroimaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Skin punch biopsy will be performed
      in a sub-set of the research cohort, defined as demonstrating a heritable phenotype of
      depression. Stool sample will be performed in a sub-set of the research cohort, defined as
      demonstrating a heritable phenotype of depression.

      Participants will complete PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), a brief self-administered
      measure of depression severity, and PS (Psychosis Screening) questionnaire, as part of
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, respectively. Participants will then complete all required
      computer-assisted self-rating and clinician-administered instruments. The self-rating
      instruments are expected to take approximately 2.5 hours using an iPad or laptop computer,
      and will collect detailed socio-demographic, life habits, family and medical history, and
      depression severity and treatment history. After completing the questionnaires, the research
      personnel will measure the subject's blood pressure, height, waist and hip circumference and
      weight. The subject will then provide blood, saliva and urine samples (morning blood draw
      appointments will be offered whenever participants agree to fast before blood draws but
      non-fasting blood will also be collected, when not possible to obtain fasting blood).

      For study assessments, specimen collection; and EEG and behavioral phenotyping, Dallas 2K
      study participants will require a 5-hour study visit to UT Southwestern. Participants will
      be given the option to split their visit into two if that is more convenient, and visit 2
      will be used to perform EEG and behavioral assessments. Participants choosing the initial
      visit at an MDN clinician's office will complete screening, assessments and biospecimen
      collection at the MDN office but will require a 3-hour visit to UT Southwestern clinics for
      EEG and behavioral assessments.

      MRI will be performed during a separate 2-hour visit to UT Southwestern MRI facility.

      Schedule of study visits, procedures and duration Study Procedure Duration

      A Assessments and Questionnaires 3 hours B EEG and Behavioral Phenotyping 3 hours C
      Neuroimaging 2 hours D Sub-Study only: Skin punch biopsy 30 minutes E Sub-Study only: Stool
      Sample 15 minutes

      Studies A and B can be combined into a single 5-hour visit when occurring at UT
      Southwestern.

      EEG and behavioral phenotyping and Neuroimaging will be performed at 6-month intervals.

      For participants in the sub-study, skin punch biopsy, Study D will be performed during any
      one of the other visits, depending on participants' convenience.

      For participants in the sub-study stool sample, study E will be performed up to 4 visits per
      year for no more than 2 years.

      Study A will then be repeated at 3-month intervals for up to 4 times a year, during
      follow-up study visits.

      Phlebotomy Procedures Blood samples will be collected from participants by trained
      phlebotomists, who will draw the sample using standard venipuncture procedures, through a
      single venipuncture using a small gauge needle. Universal precautions will be observed by
      the phlebotomists during all draws. The sample collection tubes, priority and volume
      collected are indicated in the protocol. Each tube will be labeled and packaged for
      processing and storage.

      Electrophysiology (EEG) Procedures: Participants will undergo electrophysiology measures at
      baseline and at 6-month intervals. Procedures for each of these measures are outlined below.
      Detailed EEG procedures will be described in the EEG and Behavioral Tasks Procedures Manual,
      respectively. The EEG markers in this study can be divided into three groups. Participants
      will first undergo resting EEG. Resting EEG is measured during four, 2 minute periods, half
      the time with the participants' eyes open, and the other half with the participants' eyes
      closed. The second EEG measure will specifically localize theta activity using a technique
      called Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Finally, participants will have
      head-phones placed, and will be presented with 1000 Hz tones at 5 different intensity
      levels. The loudness dependency of auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) will be measured during
      this time. The total time estimate for completion of the EEG collection at each visit is
      approximately 2 hours. The EEG workgroup will ensure that adequate training, standardization
      of measures, and validation of equipment is maintained for data consistencies and quality
      control purposes.

      Behavioral Phenotyping: The investigators will administer five distinct tasks to
      participants, to assess four domains: 1) psychomotor slowing, 2) cognitive control, 3)
      working memory, and 4) reward responsiveness. To assess these domains, the investigators
      plan to administer the following tasks: psychomotor slowing, Choice RT task (~5 min) and
      word fluency task (~5 min); cognitive control, the Flanker task (~10 min); working memory,
      the A not B task (~10 min); and reward responsiveness, the Probabilistic Reward task (~10
      min). This task measures the subject's ability to modify behavior in response to rewards. On
      each trial, the subject sees a cartoon face with a short or long mouth. The task is to
      indicate whether a short or long mouth was presented by pressing one of two buttons.
      Critically, the size difference between the short and long mouths is very small, and correct
      responses of one type (e.g., short mouth) are followed by monetary rewards three times more
      frequently than correct responses of the other type (e.g., long mouth). The primary
      dependent measure is response bias: the degree to which the subject preferentially chooses
      the response that is more frequently rewarded (in this example, short mouth vs. long mouth).
      Other dependent measures include RT and a measure of the subject's ability to discriminate
      between the mouth sizes (28). All tasks will be presented using Eprime software, under
      standardized procedures across sites. The Behavioral Phenotyping workgroup will ensure that
      quality control is maintained and that adequate training and standardization of measures is
      obtained prior to study related activities commencing. The total time the investigators
      estimate for completion of behavioral tasks at each study visit is about 1 hour.

      Neuroimaging: Eligible participants will undergo neuroimaging at baseline and at 6-month
      intervals. Neuroimaging includes both functional MRI and structural acquisitions. A brief
      description of procedures for each of these is outlined below; detailed descriptions will be
      in the Neuroimaging Procedures Manual. In total, the investigators estimate that
      approximately 90 minutes will be spent in the scanner per visit. In addition, research
      personnel will spend about 30 minutes preparing participants. Neuroimaging will be performed
      at baseline (study entry) and at 6-month intervals, for a total of 10 total neuroimaging
      sessions for the study duration.

      The collection of socio-demographics, lifestyle, clinical and other health-related
      information obtained through self-report questionnaires and clinician interviews will
      complement the physical, biological, EEG and neuroimaging measurements collected at study
      visits. The information obtained will form a database that allows a wide range of research
      questions, both anticipated and unforeseen, to be addressed in the future.

      Some questionnaires will be given to participant parents as required for minors. Additional
      assessments completed with minors will be done with study staff to assist with any questions
      or difficulty with the assessments.
