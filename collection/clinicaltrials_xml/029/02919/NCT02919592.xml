  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect additional post-approval clinical data on the
      long-term performance of MemoryShape and MemoryGel Breast Implants, as indicated for primary
      or revisional breast augmentation and primary or revisional breast reconstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The post-approval study will include 2218 women receiving MemoryShape or MemoryGel Breast
      Implants. Four cohorts will be included: primary augmentation, revision-augmentation,
      primary reconstruction, and revision-reconstruction. For the purpose of assessing
      rheumatological and neurological signs and symptoms, a control group of 300 women will be
      selected from the participating investigators' practices, who are undergoing an aesthetic
      surgery other than breast implant surgery. Breast implant patients and the concurrent
      control group patients will be followed for 10 years. Baseline and operative data will be
      collected at the beginning of the study, and follow-up data will be collected annually for
      10 years through online questionnaires.
