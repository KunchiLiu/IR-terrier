    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Prospective Clinical Evaluation of the FilmArray Lower Respiratory Tract
      Infection (LRTI) Panel BioFire Study #DX-SDY-024947 is to collect data in support of the
      proposal to the FDA to support the classification of the LRTI panel as an in vitro
      diagnostic device for the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections. The study will
      enroll up to 1500 specimens across at least 3 study sites of sputum and bronchoalveolar
      lavage (BAL) specimens that are left over as excess from routine clinical care.
      Additionally, the study will collect residual whole blood or blood fractionation to evaluate
      the utility of procalcitonin (PCT) as an additional test to diagnose lower respiratory
      infection when it is available. Enrolled sputum and BAL specimens will be run on the
      FilmArray LRTI panel. If residual whole blood or blood fractionation is available it will be
      sent to BioFire Diagnostics, LLC where they will perform PCT testing. All specimens will be
      excess from routine standard of care testing.

        The study population will include any patient's who had a BAL or sputum collected and sent
        to the clinical microbiology laboratory for routine diagnostic testing excluding any
        patients with cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Specimen is residual lower respiratory specimen (sputum, endotracheal aspirate, BAL,
             or mini-BAL) that was submitted under clinician order for standard of care

          2. Specimen has not been centrifuged

          3. Specimen has not been pretreated

          4. Specimen has at least 1.5 ml of residual volume

          5. Specimen was collected from a subject not already enrolled in the study

          6. Specimen is fresh (stored at 4C, not frozen) and was enrolled with 24 hours of
             collection

        Inclusion criteria for whole blood or blood fraction specimens (enrolled when available):

          1. PCT testing was not performed as part of routine care for the subject on a blood
             fraction specimen that was collected within 12 hours of LRT specimens collection

          2. Specimen is residual whole blood (heparinized) or blood fraction (e.g. plasma or
             serum) matched to a subject whose LRT specimen was enrolled in the study

          3. Specimen was collected within 12 hours of the time that the LRT specimen was
             collected from the subject

          4. Blood fraction (plasma or serum) is at least 0.25 mL of volume after fractionation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Specimen was centrifuged, pre-treated, or is less than 1.5 mL

          2. Specimen was collected from a subject known to have cystic fibrosis

          3. Specimens was collected from a subject known to have tuberculosis

          4. Specimen was collected from a subject that was previously enrolled in the study

          5. Specimen has been stored for longer than 24 hours, or was frozen, or stored at room
             temperature for longer than 4 hours

        Exclusion criteria for whole blood or blood fraction specimens:

          1. PCT testing was performed as part of routine clinical care on a blood fraction

          2. Specimen was not collected within 12 hours of corresponding LRT specimen

          3. Blood fraction (plasma or serum) is less than 0.25 mL of volume after fractionation
