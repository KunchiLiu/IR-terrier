      Currently, hypothetical models of understanding Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures (PNES)
      involve emotional dysregulation.

      The hypothesis of a disorder of emotional experience is mainly based on behavioral data and
      disturbance of autonomic responses in response to images in emotional content (Mignot et al
      2015, in submission; Bakvis et al 2013). Various imaging studies have identified brain
      structures belonging to the limbic system in particular that seem functionally impaired in
      this population. These functional connectivity abnormalities are correlated with
      dissociation scores in PNES patients (Van der Kruijs et al 2012 and 2014).

      Investigators propose to specifically study the brain activity of PNES patients during tasks
      emotional content to identify the mechanisms involved in this emotional dysregulation. This
      work is essential to understanding the mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic
      strategies
