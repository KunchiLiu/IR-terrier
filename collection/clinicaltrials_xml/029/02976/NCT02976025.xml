      This study evaluates the impact of a longitudinal remote consultation (LRC) implementation
      strategy for collaborative care depression treatment among perinatal women receiving care
      from federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). All participating FQHCs will receive
      training in collaborative care. Cluster randomization will be used to assign the addition of
      LRC to select FQHCs. Differences in implementation success, clinical outcomes, and costs
      will be compared after a 12 month implementation period and 13-21 month sustainment period.

      Depression is a common and serious disorder among pregnant women but few from low income
      groups receive effective treatment. The highly evidence based collaborative care (CC) model
      for depression has been shown to work for women in pregnancy but has not been widely
      implemented in this population. The proposed study targets improving dissemination of the
      evidence based CC treatment model for pregnant and postpartum women with depression, a
      common disorder of the perinatal period (pregnancy and the first year following birth).
      Longitudinal remote consultation (LRC) is an implementation strategy that has been have
      shown to improve fidelity to evidence-based practices and patient outcomes for mental health
      innovations. We believe LRC can be used with equal benefit for complex interventions such as
      CC.

      The purpose of this study is to compare two implementation strategies for Collaborative Care
      depression treatment: 1) standard implementation and 2) standard implementation +
      Longitudinal Remote Consultation (LRC). This research is being done in order to assess
      implementation and patient outcomes in sites receiving a standard implementation approach
      with and without LRC. The results of the proposed study will provide information on the
      benefits and relative value of ongoing consultation, such as LRC, for implementation of
      complex interventions like collaborative care.

      The proposed study will involve twenty federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) providing
      prenatal care and which are part of the national OCHIN Network. All sites will receive a
      standard implementation approach. After pre-implementation training ten of the sites will be
      randomly selected to receive LRC. Implementation and clinical outcomes as well as costs will
      be compared between the study conditions after a 12 month implementation period and a 13-21
      month sustainment period. The results of the proposed study will provide critical
      generalizable knowledge regarding the benefits of ongoing consultation for implementation of
      complex interventions like collaborative care.

    <description>For a cost-benefit analysis, we will use of the Cost of Implementing New Strategies (COINS) method to assess costs in the two conditions. This methodology takes advantage of the SIC-CC instrument as a costing template to map the use of resources and associated costs to these to study conditions. Costs associated with implementation in each of these conditions will be carried out for all 20 health centers included in the study.</description>
