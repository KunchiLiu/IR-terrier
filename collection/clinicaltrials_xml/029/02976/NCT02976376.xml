  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to investigate whether a smart technology intervention can improve clinical and
      cost-effectiveness of one-year follow-up in patients who suffered from acute myocardial
      infarction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Rationale: Smart technology could improve quality of care in patients after acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI) with either ST or non-ST elevation.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to measure the effect of a smart technology
      intervention on patients after AMI.

      Study design: The design of the study is a single-center, open randomized-controlled trial.
      Study population: The study population consists of patients who have been discharged from
      the ward of the cardiology department of the Leiden University Medical Center after primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for either ST or non-ST elevation myocardial
      infarction.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to either &quot;The Box&quot; or regular follow-up. Patients
      who have been randomized to The Box will receive a box containing a smartphone compatible
      electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor, a weight scale, an activity tracker and a blood pressure
      monitor. If patients are randomized to The Box, two of the four outpatient clinic visits
      will be replaced by an e-consult, in which a patient does not have to go to the hospital,
      but talks with his or her doctor or nurse practitioner via a secured video connection.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint of the study will be the percentage of
      patients with controlled blood pressure in both groups.

    <description>After randomization, patients in the intervention group will receive a box (&quot;The Box&quot;) with all the devices described above. Instructions about the installation and usage of the devices will be given. Patients will be asked to measure their weight and blood pressure once a day. Furthermore, patients will be asked to record an ECG using the AliveCor once a day. Moreover, they are asked to record an ECG in case of any complaints of possible cardiac origin, as judged by the patient. All data will be automatically transferred to the Leiden University Medical Center. Lastly, two of the four outpatient clinical visits will be done via a video connection. The content of the interview will be comparable to the content of a regular outpatient clinic visit.</description>
