  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a novel type of peripheral nerve block that
      involves innervations of the anterolateral abdominal wall derived from T6-L1.It provides
      adequate post-operative pain relieve following the various abdominal surgeries.
      Theoretically, TAP block may replace the need for epidural analgesia after abdominal
      operations. The oblique subcostal approach of the TAP (OSTAP) block, which was deÂ¬scribed by
      (Hebbard et al, 2010) , has been reported to provide analgesia to the entire anterior
      abdomen.

      The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) technique, originally described by (Rafi, 2001)
      involves injection of local anaesthetic in the plane between the internal oblique and
      transversus abdominis muscle layers, with the aim of anaesthetising the intercostal nerves
      supplying the abdominal wall. Initially, the block used surface landmarks of the triangle of
      Petit (latissimus dorsi posteriorly, external oblique superiorly, iliac crest inferiorly)
      and a double fascial 'pop' (loss of resistance) to guide placement of the local anaesthetic
      (Rafi, 2001) More recently, ultrasonography has been used to guide the delivery of the
      injectate into the appropriate plane, thereby increasing the accuracy of the technique
      (Bonnet et al, 2009, Carney et al ,2008, McDonnel et al,2008 ,Milan et al ,2011, Niraj et
      al, 2011). However, in some reports the safety of TAP blocks has been raised. . (Jankovic et
      al, 2008) There have also been reports of liver injury caused by needle damage.(Farooq et
      al,2008, Lancaster et al,2010) Theoretical concerns have also been discussed regarding the
      risk of femoral nerve palsy.( Walker et al , 2010, Rosario, et al 1997). Landmark techniques
      and utrasonography guided placement of TAP blocks may also be more difficult in obese
      patients needs experience and may be not available in certain areas.

      Recently, surgically administered TAP blocks have been described, allowing a more accurate
      placement (Owen et al, 2014, Araco et al 2010, Bharti et al 2011).
