      Aim: To compare the effects of a specific application of Mindfulness vs. Treatment-asusual
      control group in patients with bowel disease. Design: randomized controlled trial. Setting:
      Outpatient setting. Population: patients who attended bimonthly check up.

      Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal condition with a
      relapsing disease course. Managing the relapsing nature of the disease causes daily stress
      for IBD patients. Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based
      psychological program designed to help manage depressive and stress symptoms.

      Aim: To compare the effects of a specific application of Mindfulness vs. Treatment-as usual
      control group in patients with bowel disease.

      Outcome measures: quality of life, inflammatory and stress markers. Design: randomized
      controlled trial. Setting: Outpatient setting. Population: patients who attended bimonthly
      check up.

    <description>Mindfulness-based therapy has been used effectively to treat a variety of physical and psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. Recently, several lines of research have explored the potential for mindfulness-therapy in treating somatization disorders, including fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome. Mindfulness-based therapies (MBT) are a clinical application involving the key element of nonjudgmental acceptance of physical pain or psychological distress, thereby reducing the tendency to ruminate over and catastrophise these experiences.
In the present study, we propose a mindfulness intervention of 12 months, with sessions either personalized or online.</description>
