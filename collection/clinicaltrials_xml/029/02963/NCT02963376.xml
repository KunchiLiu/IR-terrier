  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and is the leading cause of
      long term disability. Distinct geographic disparities in stroke mortality, with highest
      rates in the southeast United States including Arkansas, are known as the &quot;stroke belt.&quot;
      There the average stroke mortality is ≈20% to 40% higher than the rest of the nation. Stroke
      is the leading cause of serious long-term disability. Between 2012 and 2030, disability and
      medical costs related to stroke are projected to triple, from $71.6 billion to $184.1
      billion, with the majority of the projected increase in costs arising from those 65 to 79
      years of age.

      There are two main forms of stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic. An ischemic stroke occurs in
      85% of cases and is caused by cerebral vessel occlusion, obstructing blood flow to a portion
      of the brain. Currently, the only approved therapies for acute ischemic stroke are IV tissue
      plasminogen activator (tPA), a thrombolytic agent that clears the thrombus within the blood
      vessel, or intra-arterial catheter thrombectomy. Despite the availability of therapy, it
      reaches only approximately 7% of ischemic stroke victims in the United States5. Delay beyond
      the effective time window for therapy is a common reason for failure.

      To reduce the devastating impact of stroke on individuals and society, the investigators
      continue to seek ways to improve functional recovery and limit ischemic damage in stroke
      patients. The potential neuroprotective agent, dodecafluoropentane emulsion (DDFPe) has
      recently shown strong positive effects in pre-clinical animal models of acute ischemic
      stroke6-11. Other perfluorocarbons have been tested in humans as potential neuroprotectants
      and blood substitutes yet none have been successful.
