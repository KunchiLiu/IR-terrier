             hypercholesterolemia by genetic confirmation or a clinical diagnosis based on a
             history of an untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration
             &gt;500 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) [13 millimoles/liter (mmol/L)] together with either

             study participation.

          -  Fasting central lab LDL-C concentration &gt;130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) and triglyceride

             ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30% or any cardiac arrhythmia within past 3 months
             that is not controlled by medication.

          -  Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),
             coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or stroke within 3 months of enrollment.

             anti-hypertensive therapy.

          -  Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, that is, glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &gt;10.0%
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 ml/minute/1.73 meters^2.

          -  Active liver disease defined as any known current infectious, neoplastic, or
             metabolic pathology of the liver or unexplained alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST), elevation &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN),
             at screening confirmed by a repeat measurement at least 1 week apart.

          -  Creatine kinase (CK) &gt;5 times ULN without a known cause.

          -  Other serious comorbid disease in which the life expectancy of the participant is

             other serious illnesses).

          -  Any history of malignant disease, with the exception of treated basal-cell carcinoma
             occurring &gt;5 years before screening.

             and intrauterine device) for the entire duration of the study. Exemptions from this
             criterion are as follows:

               3. Unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions, and
                  study-related restrictions (for example, uncooperative attitude, inability to
                  return for follow-up visits, and improbability of completing the study).

               4. Have any medical or surgical condition that in the opinion of the investigator
                  would put the participant at increased risk from participating in the study.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition that in the judgment of the Investigator, might
             interfere with the pharmacokinetics, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the
             study drug (if applicable).

          -  Treatment with other investigational medicinal products or devices within 30 days or
             5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the administration of the study
             drug/device or planned use of investigational medicinal products or devices.
