      SMSC will inform the design and implementation of culturally informed, community-based
      lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention in AI men in our partner communities and
      elsewhere, as well as in men of other minority groups who experience a heavy burden of
      diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      American Indian (AI) males experience profound health disparities compared to their
      counterparts in all other U.S. racial and ethnic groups. AI men have the highest
      age-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes (~18%) among U.S. men, while non-Hispanic White
      men have the lowest (~7%). In recent decades, AIs have seen a disproportionate increase in
      diabetes-related complications and mortality compared to all other groups, such that
      age-adjusted diabetes death rates in AI men are now almost twice those in White men.

      Several large randomized, con trolled trials in non-AIs confirm that type 2 diabetes can be
      prevented or delayed by interventions that promote healthy lifestyles, but little empirical
      data exist on interventions to prevent diabetes in AI men. In the clinic-based U.S. Diabetes
      Prevention Program (DPP), only 55 out of 3,234 participants were AI men. Similarly, in the
      diabetes prevention programs in Native communities, participation by AI males is low,
      ranging from 33% to 74%. Many explanations have been posited for the low participation rates
      among men of all races in lifestyle interventions. Recruiting AI men in clinic-based
      programs is difficult because they tend to seek clinical care less often than women. AI
      men's perceptions of normative health behaviors and gender roles may also discourage
      participation, particularly in mixed-gender groups. Therefore, an urgent need exists for
      diabetes risk reduction programs tailored to the unique values and habits of AI men, with a
      particular focus on recruitment and retention
