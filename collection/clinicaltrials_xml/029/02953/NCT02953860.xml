      A phase 2 study to evaluate the tolerability and clinical activity of adding enzalutamide to
      fulvestrant treatment in women with advanced breast cancer that are ER and/or PR positive
      and Her2 normal.

      This is a single arm, non-randomized, open-label phase 2 study designed to evaluate the
      tolerability and clinical activity of adding enzalutamide to fulvestrant treatment in women
      with advanced breast cancer that are ER and/or PR-positive and Her2 normal. In this study
      500 mg of Fulvestrant will be given IM on days 1, 15, 28, then every 4 weeks as per standard
      of care (SOC) and 160mg of Enzalutamide will be, in conjunction with Fulvestrant, PO daily.

    <measure>Clinical benefit rate of the combination of enzalutamide/ fulvestrant</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the clinical benefit rate (complete and partial response plus stable disease for 24 weeks) of the combination of enzalutamide/fulvestrant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Androgen receptor (AR) expression in breast tissue in the tumor biopsies of each patient</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient biopsies will be obtained pretreatment, during treatment, and at the time of tumor progression to determine the AR expression and signaling in the breast tissue. The degree of AR expression in the nucleus will be reported by immunohistochemistry (IHC) strength of staining (0-3+) and % nuclei stained and the relationship between tumor response and degree of AR expression and/or AR signaling will be examined</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the first day of enzalutamide treatment (Study Day 1) until documented disease progression or death on study, whichever occurs first.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AR signaling in breast cancer tissue in the tumor biopsies</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To obtain serial biopsies of breast cancer pretreatment, during treatment and at time of tumor progression in order to determine the extent of AR expression and signaling in breast tissue, to evaluate the effect of enzalutamide on the tumor, and to evaluate the relationship of these effects on clinical outcomes.</description>
