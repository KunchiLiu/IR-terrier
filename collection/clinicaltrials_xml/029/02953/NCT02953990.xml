  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide information about the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      effects of a biobehavioral self-management approach for perinatal depressive symptoms. This
      line of research will contribute to the body of knowledge about adjunctive therapies for
      depressive symptoms in pregnancy, a serious problem which contributes to poor maternal-child
      outcomes. Ultimately, this will contribute to the development and implementation of
      theoretically driven depression prevention/ resiliency building interventions and
      measurement of appropriate biobehavioral outcomes to determine the effectiveness of
      interventions.

      The investigators longitudinal mixed-methods study will use a one-group repeated measures
      intervention design coupled with qualitative methods to provide a comprehensive view of the
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the MOMS intervention.
      Semi-structured interviews, recruitment and retention numbers, and participant logs will be
      used to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of the intervention (Specific Aim 1).
      Recently collected archival comparison group data from an existing study will be used to
      contribute to explorations of preliminary effects of the intervention by comparing
      longitudinal psychobehavioral data, birth weight data, and genome-wide and gene-specific
      DNAm data (Specific Aims 2 and 3).
