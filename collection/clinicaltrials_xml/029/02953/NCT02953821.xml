  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) will be randomized to receive Acthar
      or placebo. Active treatment will continue for 24 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed at
      multiple timepoints using the SLE Responder Index (SRI), SLEDAI-2K, BILAG, PGA, CLASI and 28
      Joint Count

      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study. Following a screening period
      of up to 28 days, subjects with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) including moderate
      to severe rash and/or arthritis despite corticosteroid therapy will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive 1 mL (80 Units [U]) of Acthar or matching placebo. During Weeks 1 to 4, 1
      mL (80 U) of Acthar or volume matched placebo will be administered subcutaneously (SC) every
      other day. For the remainder of the study (Weeks 5 to 24), Acthar 1 mL (80 U) or volume
      matched placebo will be administered SC 2x/week.
