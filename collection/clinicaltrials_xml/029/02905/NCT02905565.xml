  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on to standard-of-care
      study with a primary objective to assess the safety of NBP treatment in patients with mild
      to moderate acute ischemic stroke. The secondary objectives include determination of PK
      profile and exploratory evaluation for the efficacy of NBP treatment in stroke patients.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Males or females aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years

          2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urine HCG pregnancy test
             at Screening and be practicing a medically acceptable method of contraception with an
             annual failure rate of less than 1% until the completion of the trial or 60 days
             after discontinuation of study treatment. Women are considered not childbearing if
             they are &gt; 1 year postmenopausal or surgically sterile (ie, hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy tubal ligation). Examples of approved
             contraception are oral progestogen, oral combined contraceptives with estrogen and
             progesterone, Depo injections, transdermally delivered contraceptives, IUD, vaginal
             ring, diaphragm with spermicide or condom, and condom with spermicide; bilateral
             tubal ligation. Vasectomy of a male partner along with a second method of approved
             contraception or abstinence as long as the subject agrees not to engage in sexual
             activity throughout the duration of trial

          3. A clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate cortical or subcortical AIS

          4. Able to swallow the softgel capsules as assessed by a swallowing evaluation

          5. Completes screening procedures such that study treatment is first administered within
             12 hours of stroke onset. The stroke onset time will be defined as the last time when
             the individual did not experience current acute stroke symptoms

          6. A standard NIHSS score of 6 to 20 and/or an age-adjusted NIHSS score of 19 to 30,
             inclusive (calculated as [age in years/5] + standard NIHSS score)

          7. Fully conscious during the screening process (slight drowsiness is acceptable)
             corresponding to a Level of Consciousness score on the NIHSS assessment of 0 to 1

          8. Functionally independent, as defined by a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 1
             before their present illness as determined by the subject or provided by a
             representative if the subject is unable to participate at the time of study entry
             (determined by retrospective assessment by the Investigator)

          9. Capable of understanding and has signed, in writing, the ICF; if the subject is not
             capable of this at the time of enrollment, an authorized representative must provide
             written informed consent and the subject will provide it when capable

         10. Agrees to comply with protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:

          1. Female subjects who are pregnant, lactating/breast-feeding, or plan to become
             pregnant within the next 3 months

          2. Suspected diagnosis other than cortical or subcortical AIS that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, may have caused the present symptoms

          3. Rapidly improving or resolving symptoms, suggesting a possible transient ischemic
             attack (TIA) rather than a qualifying stroke

          4. Signs of hemorrhage or other cause of acute stroke symptoms (other than early
             ischemic findings) on cranial imaging at Screening

          5. History of intracranial hemorrhage

          6. Seizure at onset of stroke

          7. Treated (or is expected to be treated) during this hospitalization with medications
             for cerebral edema due to stroke (eg, glycerol or mannitol)

          8. A previous clinical diagnosis of stroke will exclude the subject (however, the
             individual with a previously undiagnosed stroke evidenced on screening CT or MRI may
             be enrolled provided it does not affect neurological and functional assessments based
             in the opinion of the Investigator)

          9. Treated or plan to be treated with tPA (or other acute thrombolytics) or endovascular
             therapy; however, anticoagulants used at approved doses are permissible

         10. Uncontrolled severe hypertension defined as a systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 220 mm Hg or
             diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg

         11. Treatment with intensive antihypertensive therapy, such as intravenous (IV) sodium
             nitroprusside (Nipride®) and/or more than 30 mg of IV labetalol, between the onset of
             the AIS and the randomization to study treatment

         12. SBP &lt; 100 mm Hg, temperature &gt; 38.0º C, or heart rate &lt; 40 beats/minute or &gt; 120
             beats/minute at Screening or prior to randomization

         13. A glucose level of &lt; 50 mg/dL at Screening

         14. An international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 1.5 if not being treated with anticoagulant
             therapy, or an INR ≥ 3.5 if being treated with an acceptable anticoagulant therapy

         15. A serum ALT or AST level &gt; 1.5 × ULN, or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 ULN (except in setting of
             known Gilbert's disease) at Screening

         16. Clinically significant renal dysfunction (including serum creatinine level &gt; 2.0
             mg/dL or 177 μmol/L) at Screening

         17. A hemoglobin level &lt; 11 g/dL at Screening

         18. Current or within the last 6 months prior to Screening, New York Heart Association
             Class III/IV heart failure, severe uncorrected valve disease, known or suspected
             infective/vegetative endocarditis, ventricular tachycardia, or torsade de pointes;

         19. Corrected QT &gt; 450 ms for male subjects or &gt; 470 ms for female subjects at Screening
             or Baseline (average of 3 tracings) ECGs

         20. Current diagnosis of cancer or is being treated or has received any treatments for
             cancer within the last 5 years (except basal cell carcinoma)

         21. Known life expectancy &lt; 6 months (for any reason)

         22. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to celery or soybeans

         23. Received treatment with any other investigational drug within 30 days before Day 1,
             was previously treated with NBP, or is currently participating in another clinical
             study

         24. History of alcohol or drug dependence, or is known to have abused alcohol (eg, been
             intoxicated) within the last 24 hours or confirmed drug abuse at Screening
