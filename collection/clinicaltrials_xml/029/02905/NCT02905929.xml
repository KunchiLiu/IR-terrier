      Project 2 of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) American Heart Association (AHA)
      Women's Health Program will assess 3-month changes in sitting time, standing time, physical
      activity and blood pressure in a randomized control trial. This 2-arm randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) will occur in the community with post menopausal Latina women (N=250) who spend
      at least 8 hrs/day sitting and have increased risk for cardiovascular disease through high
      BMI and borderline hypertension. Women will be identified through the San Ysidro Health
      Clinic and assessed at the South Bay Latino Research Center.

      Project 2 will address the following aims:

        1. Investigate the 3 month effect of the intervention to impact the primary behavioral
           outcomes of sitting, standing and stepping time assessed objectively by a thigh worn
           inclinometer (ActivPAL) in Latinas at risk for heart disease.

        2. Investigate the 3 month effect of the intervention to impact the secondary health
           outcomes of blood pressure, depressive symptoms, and anthropometrics.

        3. Explore the psychosocial &amp; environmental mediators &amp; moderators of changes in sitting
           time.

    <description>The 'reduce sitting' intervention group will receive three in-person health education sessions followed by five counseling phone calls. Participants will wear a thigh worn inclinometer for the first 3 weeks of the intervention. At each in-person health education session participants will receive feedback from the ActivPAL showing periods throughout the day where participants have been sitting. In addition to the three initial in-person counseling sessions using the ActivPAL feedback, participants will receive phone calls from the health educator biweekly to help overcome barriers, to work on self-monitoring and planning skills, and to prepare relapse prevention. Tools to help prompt standing will also be provided.</description>
