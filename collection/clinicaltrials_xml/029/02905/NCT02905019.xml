  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of adjuvanted R21 alone and
      in combination with viral-vectored vaccine regimen (constituting adjuvanted R21 + ChAd63 and
      MVA encoding ME-TRAP) against malaria sporozoite challenge in healthy malaria-naive
      volunteers.

      Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited in London, Oxford and Southampton, England.

      All vaccinations will be administered intramuscularly. Each volunteer will receive either
      three or five vaccinations in total, depending on the group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Groups 1-3 consist of volunteers receiving either R21 alone or R21 + ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP
      followed by CHMI by sporozoite challenge (mosquito bite) at week 12.

      Groups 4 and 5 are infectivity-control groups for the sporozoite challenge procedures: these
      volunteers will not be vaccinated.

      Group 4 will undergo sporozoite challenge at the same time as Group 1-3 volunteers. Group 5
      volunteers will be used as infectivity controls if any volunteers from Groups 1-3 are
      rechallenged 5 - 7 months after the initial CHMI.

      Following are the vaccine schedules:

      Group 1 vaccinations- in week 0,4 and 8 Group 2 vaccinations- in week 0,4 and 8 Group 3
      vaccinations- in week 0,4 and 8 in addition to viral-vectored vaccines in week 1 and 9.

      A total of 12 volunteers will be recruited to each vaccine group.

      After the sporozoite challenge, volunteers will be treated with the topical anti-histamine
      (as a treatment for local inflammatory response) and malaria infection treated with oral
      Riamet (artemether-lumefantrine).
