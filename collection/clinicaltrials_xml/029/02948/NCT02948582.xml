  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assessed the safety and ability of an orally inhaled medicine [i.e.,
      Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution = GIS] to improve airflow in the lungs when delivered
      using an eFlow nebulizer in 42 patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
      Each patient randomly received several, single doses of GIS, or placebo, separated by
      approximately 1 to 2 weeks. After the dose was given, lung airflow was measured over 24
      hours and blood was collected to measure how much GIS was in the bloodstream. The study was
      conducted to find the once-a- day GIS dose that produced the highest improvement in lung
      airflow using the eFlow nebulizer.
