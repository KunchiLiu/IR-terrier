      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in children 6 to &lt;12 years of age with uncontrolled
      persistent asthma.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate in children 6 to &lt;12 years of age with uncontrolled persistent asthma:

        -  The safety and tolerability of dupilumab.

        -  The effect of dupilumab in improving patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

        -  The dupilumab systemic exposure and incidence of anti-drug antibodies.

        -  To explore the association between dupilumab treatment and pediatric immune responses
           to vaccines: any vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and/or seasonal
           trivalent/quadrivalent influenza vaccine.

      The total study duration per patient will be up to 69 weeks, consisting of a screening
      period of 3-5 weeks, a randomized treatment period of 52 weeks and a post-treatment period

        Inclusion criteria :

        Children 6 to &lt;12 years of age, with a physician diagnosis of persistent asthma for ≥12
        months prior to Screening, based on clinical history and examination, pulmonary function
        parameters according to Global initiative for asthma (GINA) 2015 Guidelines and the
        following criteria:

          -  Existing background therapy of medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with second
             controller medication (ie, long-acting β2 agonist [LABA], leukotriene receptor
             antagonist [LTRA], long acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA], or methylxanthines) or
             high-dose ICS alone or high dose ICS with second controller, for at least 3 months
             with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to Screening Visit 1.

          -  Pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≤95% of predicted
             normal or pre-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio &lt;0.85 at
             Screening and Baseline Visits.

          -  Reversibility of at least 10% in FEV1 after the administration of
             albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol reliever medication before
             randomization. Documented reversibility or positive airway hyperresponsiveness to
             methacholine within 12 months prior to Screening V1 is considered acceptable.

          -  Must have experienced within 1 year prior to Screening Visit 1 any of the following
             events:

               -  Treatment with a systemic corticosteroid (SCS, oral or parenteral), as
                  prescribed by a healthcare professional for worsening asthma at least once or,

               -  Hospitalization or emergency room visit for worsening asthma.

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled asthma, with at least one of the following criteria during
             the 4 (±1) weeks Screening Period:

               -  Asthma Control Questionnaire-Interviewer Administered (ACQ-IA) ACQ-5 score ≥1.5
                  on at least one day of the Screening Period.

               -  Use of reliever medication (ie, albuterol/salbutamol or
                  levalbuterol/levosalbutamol), other than as a preventive for exercise induced
                  bronchospasm, on 3 or more days per week, in at least one week during the
                  Screening Period.

               -  Sleep awakening due to asthma symptoms requiring use of reliever medication at
                  least once during the Screening Period.

               -  Asthma symptoms 3 or more days per week in at least one week during the
                  Screening Period.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients &lt;6 or ≥12 years of age.

          -  Patients with &lt;16 kg bodyweight.

          -  Any other chronic lung disease (cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, etc)
             which may impair lung function.

          -  A subject with any history of life threatening asthma (ie, extreme exacerbation that
             requires intubation).

          -  Co-morbid disease that might interfere with the evaluation of investigational
             medicinal product (IMP).
