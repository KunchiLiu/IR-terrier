  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a three-arm, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial based in
      primary care. Participating Primary Care Providers (PCPs) will be randomized to usual care
      or one of two intervention arms. The first intervention will evaluate the efficacy of an
      automated CDSS that utilizes the electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate triple marker
      test ordering, guideline implementation and BP management, compared with usual care, among
      patients with previous documentation of eGFRcreat &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2. The second intervention
      goes a step further, and it will evaluate whether a CDSS plus a pharmacist-led CKD
      management program (CDSS PLUS) can improve BP management and patient CKD and NSAID toxicity
      knowledge among the patients with newly confirmed higher-risk CKD (eGFRcreat-cys (&lt;45) or
      eGFR (45-59) + ACR ≥30), compared with CDSS alone. The primary clinical outcome is BP level,
      with secondary outcomes related to processes of care and patient knowledge.

      Setting:

      The investigators will conduct this study within the three General Internal Medicine (GIM)
      practices at UCSF. These include general internal medicine faculty physicians and residents
      who practice primary care in 10 clinical teams. This trial is specifically designed to work
      within the framework of the existing infrastructure of these practices.

      Duration of Intervention Period:

      12 months with total follow-up period of 18 months

      Randomization:

      The unit for randomization will be the PCP; there are 44 faculty physicians, 3 nurse
      practitioners (NPs) and 66 residents practicing in 10 clinical teams.

      Training and Pre-Trial Preparation:

      Prior to the beginning of this trial, all eligible PCPs at the UCSF GIM practice will have
      the opportunity for education on the Kidney Disease - Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
      guidelines in the form of a Grand Rounds. All clinical providers will be informed of this
      trial by the PI via email at which time they will have the opportunity to opt-out. PCP
      randomization will be performed by the study coordinator using an automated procedure. The
      PCPs randomized to the intervention will have the option to view a training video designed
      by study PIs and IT experts on the automated CKD CDSS.

      Blinding:

      The analysts will remain blinded throughout the trial and data analyses.

      Intervention Details (CKD CDSS):

      The CKD CDSS has been developed by the study PIs and IT experts, and refined using physician
      feedback. While the tool will be automated as much as possible using the electronic medical
      record, physician decision making will be required at all diagnostic or treatment steps in
      the CDSS. At the time the patient is enrolled, using the EHR, investigators will record the
      date of the next scheduled appointment with the PCP. If the patient has a scheduled visit
      within 90 days, the PCP will receive an initial in basket message 14 days before the
      scheduled visit. The purpose of this initial message is to alert the PCP that a patient is
      eligible for the CDSS and to facilitate ordering of tests prior to the study visit. At this
      point, the CDSS will offer the PCP three options: A) order the 3 tests, B) postpone, C)
      don't ask again. If the PCP chooses C, a menu of options will appear to select the reason
      why they are opting out. These include the exclusion criteria and &quot;I do not deem this
      testing to be appropriate for this patient&quot;. If the patient is scheduled for an appointment
      &gt;90 days in the future, the PCP will receive a similar message when the patient is
      identified as meeting enrollment criteria, followed by a subsequent message 14 days prior to
      the visit, as above.

      The CDSS will allow a &quot;second-chance&quot; for test ordering if the order is not placed prior to
      the encounter, by engaging the medical assistant (MA). In GIM practice, the MA triages
      patients, obtaining vital signs and reviews due/overdue health care maintenance for that
      patient, and the MA is able to &quot;pend&quot; orders for the physician to consider and sign during
      the visit. In the case that the PCP has not yet ordered creatinine, cystatin C or ACR for an
      eligible patient, those orders will appear as health care maintenance &quot;to-do's&quot; for the MA
      to &quot;pend&quot;. Study staff will check intervention PCP schedules on a monthly basis for upcoming
      appointments for eligible patients who were not previously scheduled. Once the tests are
      ordered, patients will proceed to the laboratory as they normally would in clinical
      practice. Patients will be alerted to pending labs via telephone call by the team MA (usual
      practice). Patients with a cell phone will receive an additional reminder via secure text
      message (newly available at UCSF).

      Once the lab has performed the tests, results will appear in the physician's electronic
      inbox in the Results folder (where the PCP usually expects them). An additional customized
      result note will be sent to the PCP for each patient, flagged under CKD-action required
      folder, (see Figure 3) which includes recommended action items. These results will include a
      calculated eGFR by creatinine, cystatin C and combined creat-cys using CKD Epi equations.

      For determination of CKD stage, the investigators will use the combined equation, as it has
      been shown to be the best estimate of measured glomerular filtration rate.

      For each suggested action item, PCP signature will be required. Links to the KDIGO heat-map
      will be available. The note will include a reminder to educate the patient on CKD status and
      NSAID avoidance. A .dot phrase (a pre-populated phrase or template that appears when
      preceded by a 'dot' in any documentation area in Epic) to use in the assessment and plan
      section of the note and patient information section of the after visit summary will be
      available for PCPs to document patient education.

      CDSS PLUS:

      The rationale for this third arm is based on the evidence that clinical pharmacists and
      nurses have been shown to be more effective than physicians alone at achieving BP control in
      other settings. However, this requires much higher cost that an electronic CDSS alone and
      requires patients to attend many more extra appointments. Thus it is important to quantify
      the added benefit of a clinical pharmacist program, as well as expenditures, feasibility and
      acceptability, in order to identify the most effective and feasible interventions. Upon
      receipt of the referral from the PCP, the pharmacist will schedule a series of appointments
      aimed at BP control, initiation or up-titration of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) /
      angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy in those with albuminuria, assessment of
      medication risk and adherence, and education. At each visit, the pharmacist will measure and
      record three seated BP readings per guidelines, and will perform medication inventory.
      Management will follow a previously designed algorithm that follows established guidelines
      for management of high BP in persons with CKD. The goal is to achieve BP &lt;140/90 mmHg and to
      use an ACE/ARB in those with albuminuria unless contraindicated. An option to a goal of
      &lt;120/80 mmHg will also be available if requested by the PCP or if the results of the SPRINT
      study change guidelines. The intervention will last for 12 months. Initially, pharmacist
      follow-up visits will be every six weeks, and once a patient's BP is controlled in two or
      more consecutive visits, follow-up will be spaced out to every 12 weeks. At the end of 12
      months, the pharmacist will no longer follow patients. To verify the fidelity of the
      intervention, the pharmacist will present several randomly chosen cases to the nephrologist
      involved in algorithm design (Dr. Peralta). The pharmacists will use previously used and
      tested CKD education (NKDEP) and NSAID education materials.

BP measures from the clinical record will be ascertained in no more than quarterly intervals in the primary care setting to avoid bias by ascertainment. Investigators will also consider the dichotomous clinical outcome &quot;achieved sustained BP control&quot;, defined as BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg in ≥ two consecutive visits during the trial.</description>
