  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of 5-0 prolene during repair of
      linear cutaneous surgery wounds improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure with 5-0
      fast absorbing gut (both SOC).

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of 5-0 prolene during repair of
      linear cutaneous surgery wounds improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure with 5-0
      fast absorbing gut (both SOC). The investigators will use a split wound model, where half of
      the wound is treated with 5-0 prolene and the other half is repaired with 5-0 fast absorbing
      gut. Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be measured via the physician observer scar
      assessment scale, a validated scar instrument (research procedure). The scar width and
      adverse events will be recorded.
