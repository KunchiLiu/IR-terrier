    <textblock>
      The study primary objective is to assess the concordance of T790M resistance mutation
      testing from hospital-based laboratories with T790M resistance mutation testing from a
      central laboratory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, real world study. 800 patients from 80 different
      hospital sites will have local T790M testing by different molecular testing platforms and
      have central testing by Cobas platform. These two sets of data (local T790M testing and
      central T790M testing) will be analysed and compared to assess the concordance of these
      T790M testing platforms.
