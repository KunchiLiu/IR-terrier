  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center pilot study of a non-myeloablative umbilical cord blood transplant
      for the treatment of a hematological malignancy with a single infusion of T regulatory
      (Treg) given shortly after umbilical cord blood transplantation and supported with ultra-low
      dose (ULD) IL-2 for 4 weeks. The goal of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility and
      safety of giving ULD IL-2 to support in vivo Treg survival and help with the design of
      future larger scale studies.
