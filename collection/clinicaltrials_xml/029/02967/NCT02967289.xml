      The trial is a phase III, multicenter, open-labeled randomized trial comparing the
      association 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) versus
      oxaliplatin, folinic acid, 5FU (mFOLFOX 6) chemotherapy protocols in patients with high-risk
      stage III colon cancer in the adjuvant setting.

      After inclusion and non-inclusion criteria have been fulfilled and the patient consent has
      been obtained, the patient will be included and randomized in the trial.The maximum delay
      allowed between the signature of the consent form by the patient and the randomization in
      the study is 28 days.

      The randomization procedure using minimization method will allocate the treatments
      mFOLFIRINOX or mFOLFOX 6 with a 1:1 ratio, and will be stratified by the following criteria:

        -  Perforation or urgent surgery versus no perforation and no urgent surgery

        -  T1-T3N2 vs T4aN1 versus T4bN1 versus T4N2

        -  Right colon (right of splenic flexure) vs left colon

        -  Country (France vs Canada) Patient eligible and who have signed the informed consent
           will be randomized in one of the two treatments arms and will receive every 14 days
           their treatment for a duration of 12 cycles.

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]</measure>
    <time_frame>2 YEARS after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the study treatment will be assessed on occurrence of Adverse Events (AEs), intake of concomitant treatments, per-treatment arising changes in physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate and body temperature), ECG, and clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, haematology). Safety parameters will be graded based on NCI CTCAE v4.03 classification.
The following parameters will be particularly followed:
The incidence of haematological toxicities (grade 3-4, in particular neutropenia and febrile neutropenia); The incidence of GI toxicities, in particular diarrhea; The incidence of peripheral neuropathy.</description>
