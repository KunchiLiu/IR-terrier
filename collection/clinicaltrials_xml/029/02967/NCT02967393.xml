      This study is designed to note whether a larger safety study using quadrivalent live
      attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) versus quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
      (IIV4)(FLUARIX®), would be feasible in children with persistent asthma. Half of the patients
      in this study will receive the FLUARIX® influenza vaccine, while the other half will receive
      a cell cultured quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV4)(Flucelvax®) being used
      as a surrogate for LAIV4.

    <textblock>
      The association of an increased risk in wheezing following receipt of a live-attenuated
      influenza vaccine in children at least 2 years of age with a prior history of asthma or
      wheeze remains unclear.

      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment
      (CISA) planned to address a data safety gap regarding use of LAIV4 vaccine in children with
      asthma by conducting a 3-site randomized, non-inferiority prospective study. The main goal
      was to compare the safety of LAIV4 versus IIV4 in children 5-11 years with persistent asthma
      during the 2016-2017 influenza season. CDC and the CISA study sites developed a protocol and
      associated materials, and were poised to begin enrollment early during the 2016-2017
      influenza season. However, after the June 22, 2016 Advisory Committee on Immunization
      Practices (ACIP) vote recommending against use of LAIV4 during the 2016-2017 influenza
      season, CDC and study investigators decided to defer implementing a study using LAIV4 during
      the 2016-2017 influenza season. Investigators will reconsider initiating this study during
      the 2017-2018 influenza season if ACIP votes to reinstate LAIV4 use or new data become
      available; ACIP makes recommendations annually.

      The planned LAIV4 study had unique features in its design that previously had not been
      implemented in vaccine safety studies, including: 1) enrolling a substantial proportion of
      children with moderate-severe asthma 2) using digital peak flow meters and 3) collecting
      clinical data through multiple, complementary, measures for 42 days after vaccination. To
      capitalize on progress made during development of the study protocol and associated
      documents and procedures, CISA is proposing to carry out a study at the three sites to
      assess the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling, retaining, and collecting clinical data on
      children 5-11 years with persistent asthma of varied levels of severity in an influenza
      vaccine safety study. Findings from this proposed feasibility study will facilitate
      improving the LAIV4 study in the future if it goes forward through the CISA Project or in
      another venue. In 2016-2017 season, FDA approved a new influenza vaccine for use in persons
      aged 4 years and older, Flucelvax® Quadrivalent (ccIIV4); ACIP incorporated this vaccine
      into its recommendations for the 2016-2017 influenza season. Therefore ccIIV4 will be used
      in place of LAIV4 for this feasibility study. There is no evidence that Flucelvax® increases
      the risk of wheezing in asthmatic children. The feasibility study also offers an opportunity
      to gain some additional descriptive safety data for this new vaccine in asthmatic children.
