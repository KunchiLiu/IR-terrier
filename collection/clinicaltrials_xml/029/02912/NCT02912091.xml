  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at blood sugar levels in pregnant women who have been given a
      glucocorticoid (steroid) medication to enhance fetal lung maturity. The findings will help
      determine the likelihood, predictive value, adverse effects, response of patients diagnosed
      with gestational diabetes and time course of blood sugar elevation following steroids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that maternal glucose levels will be elevated in the first 72
      hours after steroid administration, and that the magnitude of the peak will be predictive of
      a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. This is a retrospective chart review.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Intrauterine pregnancy at 22 weeks to 36 weeks gestation at time of steroid
             administration

          -  Singleton

          -  Patient receiving antenatal corticosteroid course for fetal lung maturity consisting
             of betamethasone or dexamethasone

          -  Age range: 14yo-50yo W-omen without known gestational diabetes and women with
             non-insulin requiring gestational diabetes (A1GDM)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with known gestational diabetes (diagnosed before steroid administration) that
             has required insulin or other medical therapy to control

          -  Women with overt diabetes which predates pregnancy.

          -  Chronic terbutaline therapy or other concurrent chronic beta-adrenergic agonist use

          -  Patients on parenteral or oral corticosteroids for reasons other than to improve
             -fetal lung maturity

          -  Multiple gestation
