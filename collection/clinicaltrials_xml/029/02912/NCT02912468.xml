      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab compared to placebo on a background of mometasone
      furoate nasal spray (MFNS) in reducing nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) severity and
      endoscopic nasal polyp score (NPS) in patients with bilateral nasal polyposis (NP). In
      addition for Japan, reduction in computed tomography (CT) scan opacification of the sinuses
      will be also a co-primary objective.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in improving total symptoms score (TSS).

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in improving sense of smell.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in reducing CT scan opacification of the sinuses
           (Primary objective for Japan).

        -  To evaluate ability of dupilumab in reducing proportion of patients requiring treatment
           with oral corticosteroids or NP surgery.

        -  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on patient reported outcomes and health related
           quality of life outcome by sinonasal outcome test-22 (SNOT-22).

        -  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab in the subgroups of patients with prior surgery and
           co-morbid asthma (including non-steroid antiinflammatory drug [NSAID] exacerbated
           respiratory disease [NERD]).

        -  To evaluate residual effect in follow up.

        -  To evaluate the safety of dupilumab in patients with bilateral NP.

        -  To evaluate functional dupilumab concentrations (systemic exposure) and incidence of
           treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA).

      The total study duration per patient is expected to be up to 52 weeks that will consist of a
      4-week run-in period, 24-week treatment period, and a 24-week posttreatment period.
