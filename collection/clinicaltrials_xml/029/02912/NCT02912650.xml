  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single-center study
      in approximately 560 subjects to determine the overall analgesic efficacy and safety of a
      fixed-dose ibuprofen 250 mg / acetaminophen 500 mg formulation compared to ibuprofen 250 mg
      alone, acetaminophen 650 mg alone, and to placebo. Subjects will be healthy males and
      females aged 18-40 years, inclusive, who are experiencing post-operative pain following
      surgical extraction of 3 or more third molar teeth. Following extraction, subjects must
      experience, within 5 hours, post-surgical pain of at least moderate severity (on a 4-point
      categorical scale), confirmed by a Visual Analog Pain Severity Rating Scale (VAS PSR) of at
      least 50 mm on a 100 mm VAS PSR scale. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive a
      single oral dose of study medication under double-blind conditions and then evaluated on
      site for 12 hours following administration of study medication. Subjects will provide
      self-ratings of pain severity and pain relief at various time points using categorical and
      numerical scales. Additionally, subjects will also evaluate the time to first perceptible
      relief and time to meaningful relief using a double stopwatch method. Finally, at 12 hours,
      subjects will complete a categorical Global Evaluation of the study medication. A review of
      any reported adverse events will also be completed.

      This is a 12-hour, 4-arm, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      single-center study in approximately 560 subjects to determine the overall analgesic
      efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose ibuprofen 250 mg / acetaminophen 500 mg formulation
      (administered as two caplets of 125 mg/250 mg IBU/APAP) compared to ibuprofen 250 mg alone,
      acetaminophen 650 mg alone, and to placebo. Subjects will be healthy males and females aged
      18-40 years, inclusive, otherwise healthy, who are experiencing post-operative pain
      following surgical extraction of 3 or more third molar teeth. Following extraction, subjects
      must experience, within 5 hours, post-surgical pain of at least moderate severity (on a
      4-point categorical scale), confirmed by a Visual Analog Pain Severity Rating Scale (VAS
      PSR) of at least 50 mm on a 100 mm VAS PSR scale. Upon completion of the baseline scales,
      eligible subjects will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of study medication under
      double-blind conditions and then evaluated on site for 12 hours following administration of
      study medication. At 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 hours post
      dose time points, subjects will provide: self-ratings of pain severity using the numerical
      and categorical PSRs; and self-ratings of pain relief at each time point using a categorical
      pain relief rating scale. At 12 hours, subjects will also complete a 6-point categorical
      Global Evaluation of the study medication. Additionally, subjects will also evaluate the
      time to first perceptible relief and time to meaningful relief using a double stopwatch
      method up to 12 hours post-dose or until the time of first rescue medication use, whichever
      is sooner. A review of any reported adverse events will also be completed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients who have undergone surgical extraction of 3 or more third molars, of
             which at least 2 must be a partial or complete bony mandibular impaction.

          -  Subject must have at least moderate pain on the 4-point categorical scale, confirmed
             by at least 50 mm on the 100 mm VAS PSR scale within approximately 5 hours (i.e.,
             less than or equal to 5 hours, 15 minutes) after surgery is completed.

          -  Female subjects are not pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  Informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence or history of any significant hepatic, renal, endocrine, cardiovascular,
             neurological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, hematologic, or metabolic
             disorder determined by the Investigator to place the subject at increased risk,
             including the presence or history within 2 years of screening.

          -  Acute localized dental alveolar infection at the time of surgery that could confound
             the post-surgical evaluation.

          -  Hypersensitivity to ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, or any other NSAID; or to APAP,
             tramadol, other opioids, or to their combinations.
