      This study aims to evaluate the risk of hyperoxia-induced hypercapnia in post-op obese
      cardiac surgery patients. It will compare two oxygenation modes in terms of their effect on
      the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) : manual titration of oxygen
      delivery for a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) target of &gt; 95 % versus automatic
      titration by a closed-loop system for a SpO2 target of 90%. 15 post-op obese cardiac surgery
      patients will be recruited and each will receive both interventions (cross-over design). The
      main outcome will be the PaCO2, which will be compared after each study period. The research
      hypothesis is that the usual SpO2 target of &gt; 95 % is associated with a greater PaCO2
      compared with a lesser SpO2 target of 90%.

      This study aims to evaluate the risk of hyperoxia-induced hypercapnia in post-op obese
      cardiac surgery patients.

      The investigators will compare two oxygenation modes in terms of their effect on PaCO2 : a
      SpO2 target of &gt; 95 % achieved with manual titration (usual practice) and a more
      conservative SpO2 target of 90 % achieved with automatic titration by a closed-loop system
      (FreeO2).

      The choice of a SpO2 target of 90 % is consistent with recent guidelines issued by the
      British Thoracic Society and the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, which both
      recommend a SpO2 target of 88-92 % for morbidly obese patients (BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2).

      FreeO2 is a closed-loop oxygen delivery system which adjusts the oxygen flow according to
      the patient's real-time SpO2 and a target programed by the physician. The system also
      records data on heart rate, respiratory rate and SpO2. Its safety and efficacy have been
      tested in healthy subjects as well as in patients suffering from COPD or acute respiratory
      distress in the emergency room, with promising results.

      The research hypothesis is that the usual SpO2 target of &gt; 95 % is associated with a greater
      PaCO2 compared with a lesser SpO2 target of 90%.

      15 obese patients will be recruited at the Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de
      pneumologie de Québec. A written consent from the patient will be obtained the day before
      the surgery. The protocol has been submitted to and approved by the establishment's ethics
      committee.

      The study will compare the effect of two different oxygenation modes on the patients' PaCO2
      immediately after extubation :

      FreeO2 mode : oxygen delivered by nasal cannula or Venturi mask (if flow &gt; 5L/min during &gt; 5
      minutes), automatically titrated for a SpO2 of 90 +/- 2 %

      Usual mode : oxygen delivered by Venturi mask, manually titrated for a SpO2 superior or
      equal to 95 % (the local protocol is to deliver a post-extubation FiO2 which is 10 %
      superior to the pre-extubation FiO2)

      Patients meeting all of the eligibility criteria will be randomized in the postoperative
      period. After extubation, they will receive oxygen for 30 minutes according to FreeO2 mode
      or the usual mode, depending on randomization. After 30 minutes, a first arterial blood gas
      will be obtained through their arterial cannula. Next, they will be oxygenated according to
      the second oxygenation mode for another 30 minutes, after which a second arterial blood gas
      will be obtained. Each patient will thus act as his own control (cross-over design).

      When patients will be oxygenated according to the usual mode, FreeO2 will be in recording
      mode, but will not be delivering any oxygen.

      The study will last 1h for each patient, and will have to begin within 30 minutes after
      extubation. A member of the research team will be at the patient's bedside for the whole
      data collecting period.

      Complete data collection should be achieved within 12 months.

      Demographic data (age, sex, weight, height and BMI) will be collected upon study entering as
      well as pre-operative room air PCO2 on capillary blood gas, type of surgery (number of
      bypass grafts, extracorporal circulation time), opiates dosage per-op and post-op, and
      pre-op left ventricular ejection fraction and renal function. FreeO2 will be recording
      respiratory rate, heart rate and SpO2 for the whole study duration. The respiratory rate
      will also be recorded manually and on the monitor. When patients will be receiving oxygen
      from FreeO2, the system will record the delivered flow ; with the usual mode, the staff will
      record the delivered FiO2. At the end of each intervention, hemodynamic measures will be
      taken : systolic, diastolic and median arterial blood pressure, systolic, diastolic and
      median pulmonary artery pressure and amine level.
