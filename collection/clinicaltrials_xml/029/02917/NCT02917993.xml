        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable locally advanced (Stage IIIB)
             or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC.

          -  Documented evidence of somatic activating mutation in EGFR (eg, G719X, exon 19
             deletion, L858R, L861Q) in a tumor tissue sample. If a tissue sample is not
             available, then EGFR mutation status may be determined from circulating tumor DNA
             obtained from a blood sample using a validated or approved test kit.

               -  Phase 1: Subjects must have previously received and progressed on or after
                  treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Additional lines of
                  systemic therapy including investigational agents for locally advanced or
                  metastatic NSCLC are allowed.

               -  Phase 2: Subjects must not have received more than 1 prior line of therapy for
                  locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. First-line treatment must include an EGFR
                  TKI, and subjects must have documented disease progression during or following
                  treatment. Subjects with disease that progressed more than 6 months after
                  completion of neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy are
                  eligible if they received an EGFR TKI as first-line treatment for advanced
                  NSCLC.

                    -  Subjects must have evidence of a T790M mutation in tumor tissue or plasma
                       obtained after disease progression during or after treatment with an EGFR
                       TKI.

          -  Radiographically measurable or evaluable disease per RECIST v1.1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects with CNS metastases
             who have completed a course of therapy would be eligible provided that they are
             clinically stable for at least 4 weeks before study entry, defined as follows:

               -  No evidence of new or enlarging CNS metastasis or new neurological symptoms
                  attributable to CNS metastases.

               -  Subjects who are receiving concomitant corticosteroids must be on a stable or
                  decreasing dose for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment and
                  off anticonvulsants for at least 4 weeks before study entry.

          -  Laboratory parameters outside the protocol-defined range.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities found on an ECG.

          -  Clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac disease.

          -  Past history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), drug induced ILD, radiation
             pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active
             ILD.

          -  Current or previous other malignancy within 2 years of study entry, except cured
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, prostate
             intraepithelial neoplasm, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other noninvasive
             malignancy.

          -  Concurrent anticancer therapy (eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery,
             immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or hormonal therapy).

          -  Any previous use of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, osimertinib, or other EGFR-directed
             therapy for T790M-mt NSCLC.
