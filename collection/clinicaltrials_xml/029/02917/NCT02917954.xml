  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canadian and international health care systems require solutions on how to address the needs
      of a relatively small population that take up a large portion of health care resources. In
      Ontario, 10% of the population accounts for 79% of total system costs, with similar trends
      found in other parts of Canada and internationally. Most high-cost users are seniors, older
      adults, with multiple chronic conditions and complex care needs who are living in the
      community. Beyond the cost issues, older adults experiencing multi-morbidity are at
      higher-risk of poor health outcomes and experience lower quality of life as compared to
      individuals experiencing single illness only.

      Since April 2013 the electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) mobile application and
      portal, has undergone a multi-phased, user-centred design evaluation approach to develop a
      tool designed to meet the needs of older adults with complex care needs and their primary
      care providers. The ePRO tool is designed to collect person-centred, person-reported
      indicators to improve care by supporting primary care delivery and enhancing patient
      self-management.

      The ePRO tool includes two features: 1) My Goal Tracker and 2) Health Journal. My Goal
      Tracker allows patients and providers to collaboratively create goal-oriented patient
      care-plans, and helps patients to track outcomes related to their goals using a mobile
      device. The Health Journal allows patients, their caregivers and primary care providers to
      monitor patients' symptoms and outcomes. The ePRO tool was re-evaluated and modified
      following each previous study phase (I-IV). This project marks the final phase of the study
      in which the investigators will conduct a pragmatic trial of the ePRO tool in 22 Family
      Health Teams in Ontario through a cluster randomized control trial with an embedded case
      study. In this evaluation of the tool the investigators will assess outcome, process and
      context measures to identify how the tool affects patients, providers and the system at
      point-of-care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pragmatic trial will take place at 22 FHTs in Ontario utilizing a cluster randomized
      control method with an embedded case study of implementation at four sites. Cluster
      randomization will assign (through number generator or coin flip) each of the 22 FHTs to
      either intervention or control group and their respective participants will be assigned
      accordingly.

      Providers and patients recruited at intervention sites will receive training on how to use
      the ePRO tool prior to the start of the trial. Intervention patients will receive one-on-one
      training with a research assistant; and provider training will occur in a group setting.
      Training will be led by a member of the research team and will take between 30-60 minutes.
      Patients and providers will also be provided with a manual and training video on how to use
      the tool and portal, and patients will be offered refresher training sessions at 3, 6, and 9
      months.

      Following consent, all patients regardless of study arm will complete surveys at baseline, 3
      months, 6 months, 9 months and post study (12 months). Intervention patients will complete
      an additional survey at study closeout to capture tool usability feedback. It is anticipated
      survey completion will take 20-35 minutes at baseline and post study.

      Additionally, intervention patients are requested to attend a minimum of two scheduled
      appointments with their provider during the study. The first (on-boarding) visit will have
      the patient and provider collaboratively discuss and set monitoring protocols for tracking.
      The second (off-boarding) visit, following the 12-month monitoring period, will allow
      patients and providers to privately discuss their experience with the ePRO, before
      participating in their respective focus group or interview. In accordance to earlier study
      phases on-boarding and off-boarding visits typically take 30 minutes. As was the case in the
      usability pilot and exploratory trial, investigators anticipate that patients will have
      additional appointments with their providers during the 12 month period at which point they
      can use the tool to discuss patient progress towards goals. Intervention patients are
      requested to attend 4-5 scheduled appointments with their provider during the study.

      Embedded within the pragmatic trial will be case studies of 4 intervention sites. Provider
      and patient participants at case sites will participate in post-intervention semi-structured
      interviews to capture implementation enablers and barriers. To adequately capture
      organizational level barriers and enablers the investigators will additionally conduct
      semi-structure interviews with organizational leaders (executive directors and/or clinical
      leads). In addition, the investigators will also collect relevant documents from
      intervention sites (i.e. organizational policies regarding the use of mobile applications or
      provider trainings and manuals in using technology as part of usual care).
