      Primary Objective:

      To compare the efficacy of alirocumab with standard of care on coronary atheroma progression
      in patients who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event and are treated with
      atorvastatin or rosuvastatin.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the efficacy of alirocumab with standard of care on absolute change in
           percent atheroma volume (PAV) and normalized total atheroma volume (TAV).

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
           apolipoprotein B (Apo-B), triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
           (non-HDL-C) and Lipoprotein(a)(Lp[a]).

        -  To evaluate the safety of alirocumab including the occurrence of cardiovascular events
           (coronary heart disease [CHD] death, non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI], fatal and
           non-fatal ischemic stroke, unstable angina requiring hospitalization).

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Patients hospitalized for ACS (Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
             [STEMI], Acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], and Unstable
             angina [UA]).

          -  Low density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥100 mg/dL.

          -  Patients who undergo Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) imaging of the coronary arteries
             with at least &gt;50% stenosis angiographically within 1 week after the ACS onset.

          -  Patients aged ≥20 years old at ACS diagnosis.

          -  Negative to serum Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B core antibody, and
             Hepatitis C antibody tests.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients who have been previously treated with at least one dose of any
             anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (anti-PCSK9) monoclonal antibody.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (multiple reading with systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt;180
             mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &gt;110 mmHg) between ACS diagnosis and
             randomization visit.

          -  Known history of hemorrhagic stroke.

          -  Currently under treatment for cancer.

          -  Patients on LDL apheresis.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality identified that in the judgment of the
             Investigator or any sub-Investigator would preclude safe completion of the study or
             constrain endpoints assessment such as major systemic diseases, patients with short
             life expectancy.

          -  Considered by the Investigator or any sub-Investigator as inappropriate for this
             study for any reason, including:

               -  Unable to meet specific protocol requirements, such as scheduled visits;

               -  Investigator or any sub-Investigator, pharmacist, study coordinator, other study
                  staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of the protocol, etc;

               -  Presence of any other conditions (eg, geographic, social, etc.) actual or
                  anticipated, that the Investigator feels would restrict or limit the patient's
                  participation for the duration of the study.

          -  Laboratory findings measured within 2 weeks after the ACS diagnosis (positive serum
             or urine pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential).

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.
