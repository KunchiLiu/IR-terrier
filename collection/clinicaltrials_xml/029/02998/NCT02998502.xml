      The Freespira Breathing System (FBS; www.freespira.com) developed by Palo Alto Health
      Sciences, Inc, is a portable home device , and has been employed in breathing biofeedback in
      adults with panic disorder (PD). The FBS has now received FDA clearance for the treatment of
      PD adults and is currently commercially available and more than 150 therapist have provided
      the service nationally. However, FBS has not yet been tested for efficacy in a pediatric
      populations. Due to its portability, FBS may pose an advantage for use in younger age
      groups, compared to multiple therapy sessions required for cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) or lower acceptability for long-term medication use for adolescent PD.

      In this pilot intervention study, the efficacy of the FBS system in youth will be tested. In
      children adolescents, PD itself is less common than in adults, but when present, PD is
      commonly associated with and/or preceded by other anxiety conditions, including generalized
      anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SoP) and separation anxiety (SAD). Thus, in children
      and adolescents, the breathing biofeedback intervention for panic, should include other
      anxiety disorders.

    <measure>Primary outcome is a score of Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) scale, the anxiety measuring scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Success is defined as a reduction in SCARED score of 25%. A clinically meaningful change in the SCARED score is a decrease in approximately 16 points (1 standard deviation in anxiety published norms) in the total score of the full scale (range 0-82), although for individual patients, a 25% decrease is considered significant clinically. The primary outcome is the SCARED anxiety score at the 8-week assessment. This is in keeping with prior experience with FBS in adults.</description>

    <measure>Clinician's Global Impression scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician's Global Impression (CGI) scale is a three item observer rated scale that measures illness severity, global improvement or change, and therapeutic response. It is rated on a seven point scale with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from one (normal) to seven (around the most severely ill patients). Each component of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score.
This will serve as the measure of overall improvement in the patients symptoms because of the FBS treatment.</description>

    <measure>Child Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Child Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale is a measure of obsessive compulsion disorder symptoms. This scale is designed to rate the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms in children from 6-17 years. In general the ratings depend on the child's and parents report; however the final rating is based on the clinical judgement of the interviewer. The characteristics of each item over the prior week up until; and including, the time of the interview are rated. The child's symptoms are scored using the compulsions checklist and the obsessions checklist as guides. All 19 items are rated but only items 1-10 are used to determine the final score. The total score is the sum of items 1-10; the obsession and compulsion subtotals are the sums of items 1-5 and 6-10, respectively. This will be measured through out the study to see the effectiveness of the treatment.</description>
