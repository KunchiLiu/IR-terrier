    <textblock>
      The study is designed primarily to assess preliminary efficacy and safety of CJM112 in
      patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne and to determine if CJM112 has an
      adequate clinical profile for further clinical development. In addition, sustainability of
      response and dose relationship will be explored.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects aged 18 to 45 years of age included, and otherwise in good
             health as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs and
             laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Body weight between 50 and 120 kg, inclusive at screening.

          -  Papulo-pustular acne vulgaris with between 25 and 100 facial inflammatory lesions
             (papules, pustules and nodules), and presence of non-inflammatory lesions (open and
             closed comedones) in the face at screening and baseline.

          -  No more than 5 facial inflammatory nodules at screening and baseline.

          -  Investigator's Global assessment (IGA) score of at least moderate (3) acne severity
             on the face at screening and baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Appropriate wash out periods are required for investigational drugs, any
             oral/systemic treatment for acne, systemic or lesional injected (for acne)
             corticosteroids or systemic immunomodulators, any systemic hormonal treatments,
             previous treatment with biologics, oral retinoids (in particular isotretinoin) and
             any topical anti-acne treatment.

          -  Use of facial medium depth chemical peels (excluding home regimens) within 3 months
             prior to baseline.

          -  Any live vaccines (this includes nasal-spray flu vaccine) starting from 6 weeks
             before baseline.

          -  Any other forms of acne

          -  Any severe, progressive or uncontrolled medical or psychiatric condition or other
             factors at randomization that in the judgment of the investigator prevents the
             patient from participating in the study.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or allergy to the investigational compound/compound class
             being used in this study.

          -  Active systemic infections (other than common cold) during the 2 weeks prior to
             baseline.

          -  History of severe systemic Candida infections or evidence of Candidiasis in the 2
             weeks prior to baseline.

          -  Evidence of active tuberculosis at screening. All patients will be tested for
             tuberculosis status using a blood test (QuantiFERONÂ®-TB (Tuberculosis) Gold In-Tube).
             Patients with evidence of tuberculosis may enter the trial afteradequate treatment
             has been started according to local regulations.

          -  Patients with known active Crohn's disease

          -  History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western
             blot) test result at screening.

          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C test result at screening

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) laboratory test.

          -  WOCBP, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they
             are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 13 weeks
             after stopping medication.
