      To determine the feasibility of a controlled trial examining the efficacy and safety of
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared with ASA for stroke prevention
      in patients with a high-risk of atrial fibrillation and previous intracerebral hemorrhage.

      The NASPAF-ICH study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, phase II study that will
      assess the feasibility of a controlled trial examining the efficacy and safety of
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared with acetylsalicylic acid
      (ASA) for stroke prevention in patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation and previous
      intracerebral hemorrhage, as well as provide evidence of efficacy and safety for planning of
      a phase III trial. Recruitment will occur at 10 high-volume stroke research centres across
      Canada over 2 years, at which 100 adult patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation (CHADS2
      ≥2) and previous spontaneous or traumatic ICH (intraparenchymal or intraventricular
      hemorrhage while on or off anticoagulation) will be randomly assigned to receive a NOAC
      (particular agent at the discretion of the local investigator) or ASA 81 mg per day.
      Patients will be followed for a mean of 1 year to a common end-study date. The feasibility
      of recruitment will also be tested. The investigators estimate that five patients per year
      per centre can be recruited.
