             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  Subjects must be willing to undergo an incisional or excisional lymph node biopsy of
             accessible adenopathy or provide the most recent, available archived tumor biopsy.

          -  Allogeneic stem cell transplant within the last 6 months, or active graft versus host
             disease following allogeneic transplant, or autologous stem cell transplant within
             the last 3 months.
