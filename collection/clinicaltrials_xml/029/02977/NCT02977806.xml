  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional indirect indicators of iron status, using serum and red blood cell biomarkers,
      are confounded by inflammation from common infections in sub-Saharan Africa, a region with a
      high prevalence of iron deficiency, making the assessment of iron balance and efficiency of
      iron intervention difficult. A new method allowing accurate measurement of long-term oral
      iron absorption and allowing the estimation of iron requirements is highly needed. Such a
      novel method to quantify iron absorption and requirements using isotope dilution
      measurements in children should be validated in the present prospective observational study
      by following-up a group of 49 children given a stable iron isotope in an earlier trial. We
      will request seven blood samples within 2 years (sampling every four months) from the
      participants which will allow us to measure isotopic dilution for estimating total oral iron
      absorption over these 24 months.
