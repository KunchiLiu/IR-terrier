  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized, open-label, effectiveness trial comparing three treatment
      arms for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients with TRD who are currently on ongoing,
      stable and adequate antidepressant therapy (ADT). Adequate ADT is defined as a
      therapeutically sufficient dose for a sufficient treatment period, which would be expected
      to be effective as listed in the MGH Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ).
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three open-label treatment arms: a)
      aripiprazole augmentation, b) rTMS augmentation, and c) switching to venlafaxine XR.

    <description>Patients randomized to this treatment arm will be instructed to continue all permitted psychotropics at their current dose throughout the 8-week trial and initiate adjunctive aripiprazole. The starting dose will be 5mg daily. The dose may be reduced to as low as 2mg for tolerability issues (this will be the lowest dose permitted for continuation in the trial). The dose may be adjusted in 2 or 5mg increments. The minimum time per increment will be 7 days. The maximum dose will be set at 15mg daily. For patients who are not on potent cytochrome 2D6 inhibitors (such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, duloxetine) or on potent cytochrome 3A4 inhibitors (such as fluvoxamine and nefazodone) and who are able to tolerate 15mg daily, the maximum dose can be raised to 20mg daily for efficacy.</description>

    <arm_group_label>rTMS Augmentation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients randomized to this treatment arm will be instructed to continue all permitted psychotropics at their current dose throughout the 8-week trial. We will use clinical TMS stimulators with focal figure-of-eight coils. We will start by measuring the patientÂ´s motor threshold (MT), which is a measure of cortical excitability used to standardize the intensity of stimulation across subjects.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Switching To Venlafaxine XR</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients randomized to this treatment arm will be instructed to continue all permitted psychotropics throughout the 8-week trial, except for their antidepressant(s). They will be instructed to discontinue all antidepressants and initiate venlafaxine that day, as direct switch to serotonergic antidepressants is well tolerated and avoids loss of precious therapeutic time (Montgomery et al., 2014), including to switching to venlafaxine in STAR*D (Rush et al., 2006b). For patients who do not prefer a direct switch, or when clinically indicated otherwise in the opinion of the site investigator, a gradual tapering during the screening period will be permitted as long as a direct switch to venlafaxine is made on the baseline visit from the final antidepressant dose. The starting dose of venlafaxine will be 75mg daily. The dose may be reduced to as low as 37.5mg for tolerability issues (this will be the lowest dose permitted for continuation in the trial).</description>

          4. meet criteria for TRD during the current major depressive episode documented in the
             MGH Antidepressant Treatment History Questionnaire (ATRQ) (Chandler et al., 2010),
