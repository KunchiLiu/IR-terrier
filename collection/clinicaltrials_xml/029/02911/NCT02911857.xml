      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of ACZ885 in this
      extension study. This extension study offers the opportunity for patients who completed
      Epoch 4 of the preceding CACZ885N2301 study to continue to be treated with ACZ885 until
      approval in Japan of the drug in Periodic Fever Syndromes or until development of ACZ885 in
      Periodic Fever Syndromes is suspended.
