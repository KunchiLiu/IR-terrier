    <textblock>
      This study is to test our automated hypoglycemia prevention and treatment device
      (glucagon-only bionic pancreas) in subjects that have undergone post-bariatric surgery that
      are experiencing symptoms of hypoglycemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 21 years or older with a gastric bypass for more than 1 year.

          -  Post-bariatric hypoglycemia with prior episodes of neuroglycopenia, unresponsive to
             dietary intervention (low glycemic index, controlled carbohydrate portions) and trial
             of acarbose therapy at the maximally tolerated dose. Other therapies will not exclude
             a subject as long as the therapy is continued during the study.

             will be allowed if well controlled).

          -  Self-reported frequency of documented hypoglycemia (BG &lt; 60 mg/dl verified by
             capillary blood glucose measurements) of at least 2 times per week.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to provide informed consent.

          -  Unable to comply with study procedures.

          -  Personal or family history of MEN 2A, MEN 2B, neurofibromatosis, or von Hippel-Lindau
             disease.

             normotension) hypertension.

          -  Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness (indicators would include symptoms
             such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and/or any psychiatric hospitalization in
             the last year).

          -  Current alcohol abuse (intake averaging &gt; 3 drinks daily in last 30 days) or
             substance abuse (any use within the last 6 months of controlled substances without a
             prescription).

          -  Unwilling or unable to refrain from drinking more than two drinks in an hour or more
             than four drinks in a day during the trial.

          -  Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might
             be susceptible to RF interference.

          -  History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and
             vomiting.

          -  Unwilling or unable to completely avoid acetaminophen during the study period.
