  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether automated cuff pressure control results in
      a reduction in the proportion of patients developing ventilator associated respiratory
      infections during their stay in intensive care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of tracheal cuff pressure control using
      continuous control via an automated electronic device as compared with intermittent pressure
      control for the prevention of ventilator associated respiratory infection in ICU.

      The study will be conducted at multiple sites in Vietnam. Recruitment will be for 18 months
      at all centers. Patients experiencing any hospital acquired infection whilst at risk of
      Ventilator Associated Respiratory Infections will be evaluated in using a standardised
      investigation protocol to identify cases of VARI and other hospital acquired infections
      (HAI)s. Assessment of VARI will be based on published criteria and carried out by an
      endpoint review committee independent of patient care and blinded to the allocation of the
      patient. Antibiotic use data and duration of stay will be important secondary outcome
      measures.
