  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the length of continuous albuterol administration between
      two different albuterol formulations, BAC containing albuterol versus preservative free
      albuterol.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the length of continuous albuterol
      administration between patients receiving BAC containing albuterol versus preservative free
      albuterol. Secondary objectives include comparison of therapy escalation, asthma scores,
      forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at discharge, length of hospital stay, and
      cost.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be included in the study if they are admitted to the 5th floor of
             Kosair Children's Hospital for the treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation,
             initiated on continuous albuterol inhalation therapy, and are between 5 and 17 years
             of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they are transferred from the 5th floor
             to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), admitted for any indication other than
             acute asthma exacerbation, or removed from the inpatient asthma protocol for any
             given reason.
