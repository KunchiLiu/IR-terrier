  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of protein quality has been identified as the top priority question by the
      Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. However, the current
      available methods do not precisely estimate protein quality, or need invasive procedures.
      The proposed 'dual tracer approach' is a non-invasive method to evaluate protein quality in
      humans.

      The present project characterizes the use of 15N-intrinsically-labelled milk protein as a
      reference-protein for development a non-invasive method that can be used to assess protein
      quality in human subjects

      Rationale: The evaluation of protein quality has been identified as the top priority
      question by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. However, the
      current available methods do not precisely estimate protein quality, or need invasive
      procedures. The proposed 'dual tracer approach' is a non-invasive method to evaluate protein
      quality in humans.

      Objective: The present project characterizes the use of 15N-intrinsically-labelled milk
      protein as a reference-protein for development a non-invasive method that can be used to
      assess protein quality in human subjects. For this purpose, our primary objectives are to
      define the digestive and metabolic behaviour and distribution of the reference
      15N-intrinsically-labelled milk protein compared to the internal standard 13C-spirulina and
      to different amounts of a 2H-labelled test protein (in this case also milk).

      Study design: Randomized cross-over trial with two experimental meals. Study population:
      Healthy male and female, age 18-35y Intervention (if applicable): On two separate test days,
      subjects will receive a semi liquid meal (pudding) divided in 9 portions, (500 Kcal; meal 1:
      35 En% Protein,10 En% fat, 55 En% carbohydrates; meal 2: 25 En% Protein,10 En% fat, 65 En%
      carbohydrates), made of a combination of jelly pudding, water and intrinsically labelled 15N
      and 2H milk protein powder. Furthermore, the meal will contain a trace amount of
      13C-labelled algae protein as an internal standard. Meals will differ in the amount (e.g.
      10g or 25g) of 2H-labelled milk protein.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The ratio of isotopic enrichment (15N/13C and 2H/15N) of
      (total) amino acids of the test meal and the blood plasma as determined by gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: A meal challenge with intrinsically labelled protein and addition of stable
      isotope tracer is frequently used in postprandial studies. Stable isotopes are naturally
      occurring isotopes and are not harmful for subjects, as there is no decay. Furthermore,
      placing venous catheters and blood sampling can occasionally cause a local haematoma or
      bruise and some participants may report pain or discomfort. Subjects have to come to the
      research facility three times, a screening visit of 1 hour, and 2 experimental days of 4
      hours. Subjects will be financially compensated for participation.
