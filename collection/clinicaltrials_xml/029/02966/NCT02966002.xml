  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure (a congenital heart surgery) may develop
      complications many years after their operation. Studies have shown that some of these
      patients develop an ongoing inflammatory state, which may be the cause of these late
      complications. Aspirin is a common over the counter anti-inflammatory medication used for
      many other chronic diseases. This study may help determine if aspirin therapy can limit the
      inflammation seen in Fontan patients and prevent these late complications.
