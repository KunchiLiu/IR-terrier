          -  Participant has therapy-related MDS (t-MDS).

          -  Participant has MDS evolving from a pre-existing myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).

          -  Participant has MDS/MPN including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical
             chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and

          -  Participant has received more than 1 prior therapy.

          -  Participant has received therapy other than azacitidine or decitabine for the
             treatment of MDS.

          -  Participant has received prior therapy with a BH3 mimetic.

          -  Participant has received hematopoietic growth factors, agents intended to improve
             blood counts (e.g., erythropoietin, eltrombopag), or corticosteroids within 14 days
