    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether a large clinical trial testing the effect of
      mild hypoxia preconditioning on neurologic outcome in patients undergoing interventional
      treatment is warranted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic cerebrovascular disease accounts for 70%-80% of all cerebrovascular diseases, the
      mortality rate and disability rate is high. Mild hypoxia preconditioning is currently widely
      used in the high altitude acclimatization, athletes, aerospace, diving and other fields.
      Mild hypoxia preconditioning refers to the body after one or more short, non lethal hypoxia,
      tolerance to subsequent longer or more severe hypoxic damage to the body. The animal model
      of mild hypoxia preconditioning has confirmed that mild hypoxic preconditioning can reduce
      the brain damage, and has a protective effect on the permeability of blood brain barrier,
      which can effectively improve the prognosis of animals with brain injury. The hypothesis of
      this protocol is that mild hypoxia preconditioning could reduces injury induced by
      interventional treatment for ischemic cerebrovascular disease. In this study, patients will
      treated with oxygen inhalation (mild hypoxia or sham preconditioning) ×7 days before surgery
      (Note: In mild hypoxia preconditioning group, the oxygen concentration decreased from 20% to
      18%, and keeping at 18%). The volume (mm3) of new lesions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI, DWI and FLAIR) and serum s-100β protein (s-100β), Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE),
      Erythropietin (EPO), Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor (VEGF), Brain Derived
      Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) concentration will be measured before and at 3, 7 days after
      oxygen inhalation, and at 1,3 and 7days after surgery. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and National
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) in all the cases will be evaluated before and at
      1, 3, 7 days after oxygen inhalation and at 1, 3, 7 days after surgery. Glasgow Outcome
      Score (GOS) will be evaluated at 1, 3, 7 days after surgery.
