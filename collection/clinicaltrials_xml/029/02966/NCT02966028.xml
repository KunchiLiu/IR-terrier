  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the effect of 2 dose levels of SNF472 (300 mg and 600 mg)
      compared to placebo on the progression of absolute change in coronary artery calcium volume
      score over a 12‑month (52 weeks) period in ESRD patients on HD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reducing the progression of cardiovascular calcification (CVC) in HD patients may improve
      the severe burden of CV disease related to the underlying ESRD. As no therapy is currently
      indicated to target CVC, there is a need to investigate the ability of SNF472 to reduce CVC
      progression and, ultimately, to improve CV outcomes in HD patients. This phase 2b
      double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study is designed to assess the effect of
      SNF472 on the progression of CVC as measured by calcium volume and CAC/Agatston scores in
      ESRD patients receiving HD. The study hypothesis is that administration of SNF472 over 52
      weeks can slow the progression of CVC in this patient population compared to placebo.
