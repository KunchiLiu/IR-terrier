    <textblock>
      The Engagement of Patients with Advanced Cancer is an intervention that utilizes
      well-trained lay health coaches to engage patients and their families in goals of care and
      shared decision-making after a diagnosis of advanced cancer. Although lay health workers
      have never been tested in this role, we hypothesize that lay health workers can feasibly
      improve goals of care documentation and help to reduce unwanted healthcare utilization at
      the end of life for Veterans diagnosed with new advanced stages of cancer and those
      diagnosed with recurrent disease.

      VAPAHCS proposes to implement and evaluate several critical elements to be in alignment with
      the VHA's Strategic Goal and priority areas for FY2013. The Engagement of Patients with
      Advanced Cancer project is an innovative program that will strengthen provider-patient
      relationship and facilitate whole person care about matters important to Veterans with
      cancer and important to support network and family. The project is intended to help
      establish Goals of Care Plan with appropriate documentation, develop, deploy, and evaluate a
      model of care for persons with cancer that is intended to improve clinical outcomes and
      experience of care for individuals with advanced cancer who have advanced cancer (stages
      III, IV or recurrent disease). The intervention provides patients with lay health coaches
      who assist patients and their families in discussing goals of care and engage in
      shared-decision making. The goal of the project is to demonstrate that there is improved
      patient experiences, outcomes, and that the program helps to reduce utilization of health
      care resources at the end of life.
