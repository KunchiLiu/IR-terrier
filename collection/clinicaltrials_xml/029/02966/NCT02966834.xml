    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      GSK2330672 administration for the treatment of pruritus (itch) in participants with primary
      biliary cholangitis (PBC). Participants will be treated with either placebo or one of the 4
      dose regimens of GSK2330672 (20 milligram [mg], 90 mg or 180 mg taken once daily or 90 mg
      twice daily). Subjects on GSK2330672 will also receive placebo tablets to maintain blinding.
      The total duration of a subject's participation will be up to 45 days of screening and 24
      weeks of study including follow-up.
