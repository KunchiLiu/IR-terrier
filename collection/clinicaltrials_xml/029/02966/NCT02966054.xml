  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiologic data consistently indicate that colorectal cancer survivors can improve their
      quality-of-life and prognosis by engaging in physical activity. This study aims to build on
      this epidemiologic work and translate the findings to inform and change patient behavior.
      The specific aims are to: (1) Develop a mobile technology physical activity intervention
      among colorectal cancer patients who have completed therapy. (2) Conduct a 3-month pilot
      randomized controlled trial utilizing mobile technology to increase physical activity among
      40 men and women who have completed standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for primary stage I-III
      colorectal cancer at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. Participants
      in the intervention arm will receive a Fitbit® for self-monitoring, interactive text
      messages, and educational print materials; participants in the control arm will receive
      educational print materials at baseline and will be given a Fitbit® after completion of the
      3-mo. follow-up assessment.
