      The objective of the proposed project is to evaluate adverse maternal and fetal outcomes in
      women who are treated and women who are untreated with mood stabilizing medication for
      bipolar disorder during pregnancy, compared to women without bipolar disorder during
      pregnancy.

    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a chronic and episodic mental illnesses characterized by recurrent
      episodes of mania, hypomania, and depression separated by periods of normal mood. Unlike
      normal mood fluctuations, bipolar disorder results in extreme shifts of a person's mood and
      behaviour. In Canada, the estimated lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder is 2.2% and it
      is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. While there no cure for bipolar
      disorder, treatment is available to manage frequent relapses and alleviate mood symptoms.
      The pharmacotherapy regimen consists of mood stabilizers alone or in combination with
      antipsychotic agents and antidepressants. The overarching goal of treatment is to achieve a
      euthymic state and to restore psychosocial functioning and reduce associated mortality and
      morbidity.

      The onset of BD typically occurs during adolescence and early adulthood and
      disproportionately affects women, placing them at risk of experiencing recurrence episodes
      throughout their childbearing years. Women with bipolar disorder are faced with a dilemma
      when making the decision to maintain treatment during pregnancy. Some choose to stop
      treatment to minimize the risk of exposing the fetus to the medications out of concern of
      harm. Alternatively, discontinuing treatment increases the risk of illness recurrences such
      that it may compromise the mother's ability to care for herself and the baby. Prior evidence
      suggests that there is a 70% risk of relapse during pregnancy among women who choose to
      discontinue medication, particularly when stopped abruptly.

      There remains much uncertainty about the effects of using mood-stabilizing treatment for
      bipolar disorder during pregnancy. Studies that have investigated the safety of mood
      stabilizer use during pregnancy have presented inconclusive results.

        Women between the ages of 15 and 40 years who were hospitalized for a singleton
        obstetrical delivery between 2000-2014. Additionally, these women must be covered under
        the provincial drug benefit plan during index pregnancy, which is defined as having filled
        a drug prescription in the period from six months prior to pregnancy to six months after
        delivery. For women who had multiple pregnancies over the study period, we will randonmly
        select one as the index pregnancy.
