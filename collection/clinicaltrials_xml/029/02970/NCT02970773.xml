      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic and -dynamic
      properties of rivaroxaban after oral administration in cervical spinal cord injury (SCI)
      individuals.

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine the steady-state rivaroxaban activity
      in cervical SCI individuals under long-term therapy.

      Primary Objective In-house patients will be informed concerning the study and informed
      consent will be collected.

      During the screening day, in- / exclusion criteria will be assessed and a blood samples will
      be taken for assessing haematology, clinical chemistry and coagulation parameters.
      Furthermore, the evaluation day will be scheduled.

      On the evaluation day, in- / exclusion criteria will be re-assessed. A venous catheter will
      be introduced into a forearm or lower leg of each participant for the collection of blood at
      the specified time points. Skin inspection for subcutaneous bleeding will be performed and
      vital signs will be recorded. A blood sample will be taken for assessing haematology,
      clinical chemistry and coagulation parameters.

      Single administration of oral rivaroxaban in the form of XareltoÂ® 10mg tablets (Bayer
      Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany).

      Rivaroxaban concentrations will be determined from plasma samples taken before, 30min after
      and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours after rivaroxaban administration. Rivaroxaban activity
      will be determined from plasma samples taken before, 30min after and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,
      12, 24 hours after rivaroxaban administration using a factor Xa inhibition test and
      measuring prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

      Skin inspection for subcutaneous bleeding and measurements of vital signs will be performed
      30min and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after rivaroxaban administration.

      Secondary Objective Patients under long-term rivaroxaban therapy will be recruited during
      their annual check-up visit at the Swiss Paraplegic Centre. In- / exclusion criteria will be
      assessed, and the patients will be informed concerning the study and informed consent will
      be collected.

      Blood samples will be taken for assessing haematology, clinical chemistry and coagulation
      parameters, and skin inspection for subcutaneous bleeding and measurements of vital signs
      will be performed.

      A blood sample (4.3ml citrated venous blood) will be taken for assessing the primary and
      secondary outcome parameters.
