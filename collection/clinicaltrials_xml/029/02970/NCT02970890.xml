  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic degenerative muscle disease characterized by cartilage wear,
      causes progressive joint deformity and loss of function leading to the indication of total
      hip arthroplasty (THA), when conservative treatments fail. Surgical trauma leads to pain and
      induces an immune response. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has proven effective in tissue
      repair by modulating the inflammatory process and promoting pain relief. It can therefore be
      part of the treatment. This study aims to analyze the effect of PMBT on inflammation and
      pain of patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty. The study will consist of eighteen
      patients who underwent hip arthroplasty and they will receive phototherapy in a period from
      8 to 12 hours after surgery, they will divide into two groups (n=9 each) placebo and
      effective phototherapy. The patients will be evaluated before and after phototherapy with 9
      diodes, applied to 5 points along the scar (1 laser 905nm, 4 LEDs 875nm and 4 LEDs 640nm,
      40.3J total), by visual analogue scale (VAS) and blood collection for analysis of the levels
      of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8.
