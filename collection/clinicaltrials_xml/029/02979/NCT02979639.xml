  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals'
      HZ/su vaccine on Quality of Life (QoL) in adults ≥ 50 years of age.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the impact of HZ/su vaccination on the QoL and physical functioning
      (PF) in 400 adults ≥ 50 years of age (YOA) via Patient Reported Outcome questionnaires SF-36
      and EQ-5D. In addition to the SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires, further characterization of
      the reactogenicity of the vaccine will be made through diary card data collection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to performance of any study
             specific procedure.

          -  A male or female aged ≥ 50 YOA at the time of consent.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

               -  For this study population, non-childbearing potential is defined as current
                  tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make intramuscular
             (IM) injection unsafe.

          -  Use or planned use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine)
             other than the study vaccine or current participation or planned concurrent
             participation in another clinical study, in which the subject has been or will be
             exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product during the period
             starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine and the study end.

          -  Use or anticipated use of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during
             the period starting 180 days prior to study start and during the whole study period.
             This includes chronic administration of corticosteroids, long-acting immune-modifying
             agents or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy. Inhaled, topical and intra-articular
             corticosteroids are allowed.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting
             from disease or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products in the period starting 90
             days preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the
             study period.

          -  Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine in the period starting 30
             days before the first dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after the last dose of
             study vaccine, or, administration or planned administration of a non-replicating
             vaccine in the period starting 15 days prior to and ending 14 days after either dose
             of study vaccine.

          -  Previous or planned administration of a vaccine against HZ other than the study
             vaccine, during the entire study period.

          -  History of HZ.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

             precautions.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Significant underlying illness requiring medications that might confound the
             evaluation of general/ local AEs, or in the opinion of the investigator, would be
             expected to prevent completion of the study.

          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with
             the evaluations required by the study.
