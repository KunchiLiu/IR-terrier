    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of switching to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) versus continuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (TDF) in virologically suppressed adults with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

          -  Documented evidence of chronic HBV infection previously

          -  Maintained on TDF 300 mg QD for at least 48 weeks, and as monotherapy for chronic
             hepatitis B for at least 24 weeks with viral suppression (HBV DNA &lt; LLOQ) for a
             minimum of 12 weeks prior to screening

          -  Adequate renal function

          -  Normal ECG

          -  Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma

          -  Current evidence of, or recent (≤ 5 year) history of clinical hepatic decompensation

          -  Abnormal hematological and biochemical parameters, including:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or ALT &gt; 5 × upper limit of the normal range
                  (ULN)

               -  Albumin &lt; 3.0 mg/ dL

               -  International normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 × ULN (unless stable on anticoagulant

          -  Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant

          -  Malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, with the exception of specific cancers
             that are cured by surgical resection (eg, basal cell skin cancer). Individuals under
             evaluation for possible malignancy are not eligible.

          -  Currently receiving therapy with immunomodulators (eg, corticosteroids), nephrotoxic
             agents, or agents capable of modifying renal excretion

          -  Individuals receiving ongoing therapy with drugs not to be used with tenofovir
             alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or individuals with a known
             hypersensitivity to study drugs, metabolites, or formulation excipients

          -  Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially
             interfere with compliance

          -  Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would make the individual unsuitable for the study or unable to comply
             with dosing requirements.

          -  Use of investigational agents within 3 months of screening, unless allowed by the
             sponsor
