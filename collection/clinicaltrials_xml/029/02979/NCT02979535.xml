    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of CYD dengue vaccine
      and Cervarix when administered concomitantly or sequentially in healthy female subjects aged
      9-14 years of age.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of geometric mean titers) to
           Cervarix after concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential administration
           with the CYD dengue vaccine measured 28 days after the last dose of Cervarix.

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine after
           concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential administration with Cervarix
           measured 28 days after the last dose of the CYD dengue vaccine.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of seroconversion) to
           Cervarix after concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential administration
           with the CYD dengue vaccine measured 28 days after the last dose of Cervarix

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to Cervarix at baseline and after each dose of
           Cervarix in each and any group

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine at baseline and after
           each dose of the CYD dengue vaccine, in each and any group

        -  To describe the safety of Cervarix and CYD dengue vaccine after each and any dose in
           each group.

      All study participants will receive 3 doses of the CYD dengue vaccine and 2 doses of
      Cervarix administered either concomitantly or sequentially , They will be assessed for CYD
      immunogenicity and human papilloma virus (HPV) immunogenicity and safety up to 6 months
      after the last injection.
