      The study will examine whether changes in background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular
      breast imaging (MBI) can be induced by short-term use of low-dose tamoxifen. Women who have
      previously had high BPU on MBI will be recruited. Participants will take low-dose tamoxifen
      for a 30-day period, with post-tamoxifen MBI in order to investigate the impact of tamoxifen
      on BPU.
