    <textblock>
      Conventional indirect indicators of iron status, using serum and red blood cell biomarkers,
      are confounded by inflammation from common infections and are therefore of limited use in
      populations carrying a high burden of infection and inflammation, as for example women of
      reproductive age in malaria endemic areas in developing countries. Even without the
      confounding effect of inflammation, current markers of iron status are insensitive to small
      changes in dietary iron and do not allow to establish associations between dietary,
      lifestyle and genetic factors and iron balance. With a new method based on the dilution of a
      previously administered and equilibrated stable isotope signal, an accurate measurement of
      long-term oral iron balance and absorption is possible, allowing the estimation of iron
      requirements and potentially providing fundamental guidance for supplementation and
      fortification programs in both healthy and chronically inflamed/infected patients. In the
      current study the novel methodology will be validated in generally healthy subjects with low
      iron status. The technique will be used to assess dietary and lifestyle determinants of iron
      status and to compare the effect on iron balance and iron status of three distinct, commonly
      used iron interventions: food fortification with iron; oral iron supplementation, and
      intravenous iron infusion.
