  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of TRC105 in combination with standard dose pazopanib compared to single
      agent pazopanib in patients with angiosarcoma not amenable to curative intent surgery (e.g.,
      metastatic or bulky disease, and disease for which surgical resection would carry an
      unacceptable risk to the patient) who have not received pazopanib or TRC105 previously.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TRC105 (carotuximab) is a monoclonal antibody to endoglin (CD105), an essential angiogenic
      target highly expressed on tumor vessels that is distinct from VEGFR. Endoglin is also
      expressed directly on tumor cells in angiosarcoma and is upregulated following VEGF
      inhibition. TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models
      and complements the activity of bevacizumab and multi-kinase inhibitors that target the
      VEGFR.

      Pazopanib is an oral inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 at therapeutic plasma
      concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and
      cancer progression.

      By targeting a non-VEGF pathway that is upregulated following VEGF inhibition, TRC105 has
      the potential to complement VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and could represent a
      major advance in the treatment of angiosarcoma. Together, the use of TRC105 with pazopanib
      may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy over
      that seen with pazopanib alone.

         27. Other severe acute or chronic medical (including bone marrow suppressive diseases) or
             psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated
             with study participation, impede the ability of the patient to complete all
             protocol-specified activities, or may interfere with the interpretation of study
             results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for this study
