  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Ischemic stroke (AIS) remains a leading cause of adult disability, cognitive
      impairment and mortality worldwide despite the development of revascularization therapies
      (intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) and endovascular therapy). Thrombosis
      resistance after IV t-PA therapy is frequent especially in case of AIS with proximal
      occlusion. In recent years, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been identified as
      major triggers and structural factors of various forms of thrombosis. NETs are extracellular
      webs primarily composed of DNA from neutrophils. A recent study shows that the NETs burden
      in coronary thrombi is positively correlated with the infarct size and negatively correlated
      with electrocardiogram (ST-segment) resolution. This later study revealed that in vitro
      addition of DNase I accelerated the t-PA-induced thrombolysis of coronary thrombi. NETs
      could, in consequence, be promising targets for improved thrombolysis in AIS.

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of NETs composition of thrombi retrieved
      during endovascular therapy in AIS patients on IV t-PA induced thrombolysis, clinical
      outcome and AIS etiologies.
