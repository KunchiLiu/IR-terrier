  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inspire intends to conduct this registry to: 1) collect Inspire therapy clinical evidence in
      the clinical practice setting; 2) collect additional information on the effectiveness, use
      and safety in the commercial setting; and 3) engage physician customers to report the
      collective outcome within a group of properly trained programs that utilize Inspire therapy
      on a regular basis.

    <textblock>
      This registry is a multi-center, prospective, observational registry, conducted in the
      United States and Europe. Some data may be collected retrospectively in patients currently
      implanted (implanted prior to enrollment) through the 12-month follow-up time frame. The
      CE-marked and FDA-approved Inspire system will be used within its intended use, allowing for
      of use of any future approved system component models. This protocol does not include any
      additional stressful or invasive tests, which are not a part of standard of care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Apnea Hypopnea (AHI) from Baseline to 12-Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) is a measure of OSA severity. The AHI will be determined by the AHI score at the post-titration visit compared with the pre-implant baseline score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) from Baseline to 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a validated instruction that rates a subject's daytime sleepiness. The ESS efficacy endpoint will be determined by the ESS score at the 12-month follow-up as compared to baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Experience with Therapy (PET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PET is a survey deigned to collect information about patients' experience with the Inspire therapy. Information will be collected once the therapy is activated about relative satisfaction with the therapy over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapy Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Therapy use, reported as hours of use per week, is record by Inspire device and can be collected upon interrogation of the device in the clinic. This value can be used to quantify device use and adherence over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Advance or Additional Titrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will report the number of in-office or sleep lab device titrations completed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure, and height (in either cm or in) &amp; weight (in either kg or lbs) will be used to calculate Body Mass Index at baseline and through study completion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a seven point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device Data Collection</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Device programming and adjustment data recorded during follow-up visits will be collected from physician and patient programmers.</description>
