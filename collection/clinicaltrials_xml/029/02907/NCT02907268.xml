  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 16-week single-blind, split-face, randomized study. Each patient served as their own
      control, receiving onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA randomized to either the left
      or right side of the face. Patients received intradermal BTXA injections at week 0 and
      intramuscular BTXA injections at week 2. The objective is to examine the effectiveness of
      intradermal botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) injection in improving skin texture and midface
      lift while reducing pore size and sebum production, as well as investigate the differences
      in effectiveness between onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA using intradermal and
      intramuscular injection methods.

    <description>The first treatment group received onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) on the right side of their face and abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport) on the left side of their face. Baseline treatment at Week 0 included the intradermal injection of onabotulinumtoxinA on one side of the face and abobotulinumtoxinA on the other. Patients were treated at Week 2 with traditional intramuscular injections consisting of onabotulinumtoxinA on the same side of their face as at Week 0 and abobotulinumtoxinA on the other side. Patients were treated based on individual need, and thus the treatment volumes were not controlled or standardized.</description>
