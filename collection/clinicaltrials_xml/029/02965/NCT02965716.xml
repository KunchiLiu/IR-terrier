    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab work in
      treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma. Biological therapies, such as talimogene
      laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Giving talimogene laherparepvec and pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with
      melanoma by shrinking the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the durable response rate of treatment with talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC)
      in combination with pembrolizumab following progression on prior anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1
      therapy alone or in combination with other agents different from T-VEC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the objective response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial
      responses) in the injected lesions.

      II. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) in the non-visceral, non-injected lesions.

      III. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) in the visceral lesions (Cohort A).

      IV. To estimate the overall objective response rate (ORR). V. To estimate the median
      progression-free survival (PFS). VI. To estimate the median overall survival (OS). VII. To
      evaluate the toxicity of the regimen.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether adding T-VEC to PD1 blockade can increase T-cell infiltration into
      tumors and whether change in T-cell infiltration is associated with response.

      II. To evaluate whether adding T-VEC to PD1 blockade can increase T-cell receptor (TCR)
      clonality in tumors and in peripheral blood and whether increased TCR clonality is
      associated with response.

      III. To evaluate whether intra-tumoral injection of T-VEC is associated with the tumor
      immune microenvironment.

      IV. To evaluate whether tumor mutational load and mutations in the IFN pathway is associated
      with response to T-VEC plus pembrolizumab therapy in the anti-PD1/L1 therapy refractory
      melanoma patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intralesionally (IL) and pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2
      years and then annually for a total of 5 years.

The analysis will be repeated to compare TCR clonality at progression to baseline among patients who progress. To assess the hypothesis that TCR clonality is higher in patients who respond to the combination therapy, suggesting that the T-cells are targeting the tumor, the clonality metric will be computed as the normalized Shannon entropy for all patients at baseline and week 2.

For each marker, a difference in expression will be tested between baseline and the 2 weeks using paired t-tests at the alpha = 0.005 level to accommodate multiple comparisons.

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess the association between overall mutational load at each time point, separately, and durable response rate. Logistic regression to regress response status on the mutation rates (at baseline or at week 2) and use a 1-df test to obtain a p-value for the association between durable response and mutation rate will be used.</description>

To estimate the anticipated power, it is assumed that a paired t-test will be used (although the distribution of mutational load is highly skewed, the change in mutational load may be sufficiently well behaved).</description>
