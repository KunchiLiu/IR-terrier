    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of SADBE in the prevention of recurrent herpes
      labialis in adults. Two-thirds of the participants will receive a SADBE solution, while the
      other third will receive only the vehicle as a placebo control. The solutions will be
      administered topically to the patient's arms. The study will compare a single-arm
      application versus a two-arm application versus two placebo doses on the arm.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of herpes labialis, which may be made at the screening visit based
             on the patient's self-reported history of symptoms. An active herpes labialis
             outbreak at the time of entry into the clinical trial will neither be required nor
             will be an exclusion criteria.

          -  Self report having four or more episodes of herpes labialis in the past 12 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  People that have had treatment with anti viral therapy within 2 weeks before
             sensitization dose.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Current or recurrent non-herpetic infection or any underlying condition that may
             predispose to infection or anyone who has been admitted to the hospital due to
             bacteremia, pneumonia or any other serious infection.

          -  Therapy with glucocorticoid or immunosuppressants at time of recruitment or within
             past 4 weeks, except for inhaled corticosteroids for asthma or topical steroids in
             sites other than face.

          -  History of malignancy (except patients with surgically cured basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancers)

          -  History of organ transplantation

          -  HIV-positive status determined by history at screening or known history of any other
             immunosuppressive disease.

          -  Severe co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, CHF (EF&lt;50% at baseline
             will be exclusionary) MI, CVA or TIA within 3 months of screening visit, unstable
             angina pectoris, oxygen-dependent severe pulmonary disease

          -  History of exposure to squaric acid or squaric acid dibutyl ester.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to DMSO

          -  Any condition judged by the investigator to cause this clinical trial to be
             detrimental to the patient.

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial(s), or
             subject has received other investigational agent(s) within 28 days of baseline visit.

          -  Previous or current participation in a clinical trial of SADBE to treat herpes
             labialis.
