  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Primary purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose [RP2D(s)] for
      JNJ-63723283 in Part 1 and to assess the anti-tumor activity of JNJ-63723283 at the RP2D(s)
      in participants with selected advanced cancers including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      melanoma, renal, bladder, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and gastric/esophageal cancer in
      Part 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a First in Human (FIH), open-label (all people involved know the identity of the
      intervention), multicenter (more than 1 study site) study in participants with advanced
      cancers to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D[s]) for JNJ-63723283 in Part 1 and
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the RP2D(s) in Part 2. Subject participation will
      include a Screening Phase (28 Days) during which participant eligibility will be reviewed
      prior to administration of the first dose of JNJ-63723283; a Treatment Phase that will start
      at the first dose and continue until treatment is discontinued; and a Survival Follow-up
      Phase starting upon completion of the End-of-Treatment Visit and ends when the participant
      completes or withdrawals from the study. The end of the study is defined as last study
      assessment for the last participant on study or if the sponsor terminates the study,
      whichever comes first. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.
