      The aim of the study is to describe the safety and immunogenicity of the 2016-2017
      formulations of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine in children 3 to &lt; 9 years of age and in adults
      18 to &lt; 65 years or age, and of the 2016-2017 formulation of Fluzone High-Dose vaccine in
      adults ≥ 65 years of age.

      Primary Observational Objectives

        -  To describe the safety of the 2016-2017 formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine in
           children 3 to &lt; 9 years of age and adults 18 to &lt; 65 years of age, and the safety of
           the 2016-2017 formulation of Fluzone High-Dose vaccine in adults ≥ 65 years of age.

      Observational Objectives:

        -  To describe the immunogenicity of the 2016-2017 formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent
           vaccine in children 3 to &lt; 9 years of age and adults 18 to &lt; 65 years of age, and the
           immunogenicity of the 2016-2017 formulation of Fluzone High-Dose vaccine in adults ≥ 65
           years of age.

        -  To submit available sera from approximately 90 subjects (30 subjects 3 to &lt; 9 years of
           age and 30 subjects 18 to &lt; 65 years of age who receive Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine,
           and 30 subjects ≥ 65 years of age who receive Fluzone High-Dose vaccine) to CBER for
           further analysis by the WHO, the CDC, and the FDA to support formulation
           recommendations for subsequent influenza vaccines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive a 0.5-mL intramuscular dose of their assigned vaccine at Visit
      1. For subjects 3 to &lt; 9 years of age for whom 2 doses of influenza vaccine are recommended
      per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance, a second dose of Fluzone
      Quadrivalent vaccine (of the same volume) will be administered during Visit 2.

      Participants will be followed from Visit 1 to Visit 2 for evaluation of safety outcomes.
      Solicited adverse event information will be collected for 7 days after vaccination.
      Unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be
      collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2, or to Visit 3 for those subjects receiving 2 doses of
      study vaccine.

      Immunogenicity will be evaluated in all subjects prior to vaccination on day 0 (Visit 1) and
      on day 28 for 3 to &lt; 9 year olds and 21 days for adults 18 years and older, following final
      vaccination.
