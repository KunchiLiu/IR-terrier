  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best radiation dose for participants with
      meningioma that has grown back after previous surgery, or which the surgeon has been unable
      to remove completely. This research study is designed to determine whether a higher dose of
      radiation will decrease the likelihood that the tumor will grow back, compared to the
      probability of re-growth that occurs after standard radiation doses.

      -  After initial interview and physical examination, an immobilization device (head mask,
           neck support, back support, etc.) will be made for the participant. A treatment
           planning CT will be performed and a radiation treatment plan will be based on this CT
           scan.

        -  The radiation dose will usually be given once a day, five days per week. The radiation
           treatment will take between 7 and 8 1/2 weeks, including treatment planning.

        -  Treatment doses will vary, and the dose each participant will receive will be made on
           the basis of random assignment. Participants will either receive the usual dose of 55.8
           CGE in 31 treatments or 1.8 CGE, or 63 CGE in 35 treatments of 1.8 CGE.

    <measure>Relationship of dose and response based on progression free survival for patients treated with combined proton and photon radiation at doses of 55.8 CGE or 63 CGE.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test are used to compare the distribution of patient characteristics between arms, depending on whether the data were binary, categorical or continuous covariates. Progression free survival (PFS) is measured from the starting date of radiation therapy and analyzed by intention to treat. PFS is measured until the earlier, date of death or development of radiologic progression, and is otherwise censored at the last follow-up for progression-free patients still alive. PFS rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) based on Greenwood's formula and compared using the log-rank test.</description>
