        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be able to provide written, personally signed, and dated informed consent to
             participate in the study before completing any study-related procedures. As
             applicable, a parent/both parents or legally authorized representative (LAR) must
             provide signature of informed consent and there must be documentation of assent by
             the subject before completing any study-related procedures.

          2. Be ≥16 years of age at the time of consent.

          3. Be a recipient of hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

          4. Have a documented asymptomatic CMV infection, with a screening value of CMV DNA ≥910
             IU/mL to ≤ 91000 IU/mL in plasma or ≥2730 IU/mL to ≤273000 IU/mL in whole blood in 2
             consecutive assessments, separated by at least 1 day, as determined by local or
             central specialty laboratory quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or
             comparable quantitative CMV DNA results. Both samples should be taken within 14 days
             prior to randomization with second sample obtained within 5 days prior to
             randomization. Same laboratory and same sample type (plasma or whole blood) should be
             used for these assessments. Asymptomatic CMV infection is defined as an infection
             that does not present with tissue invasive CMV disease, as assessed by the
             investigator.

          5. If presenting with recurrent CMV infection, have at least 2 weeks of undetectable CMV
             DNA (based on local laboratory results, using same laboratory and same sample type)
             and be off antiviral treatment between their current and prior infection (for at
             least two weeks). Otherwise, the current infection will be considered a continuation
             of the prior infection.

          6. Per investigator's judgment, be eligible for treatment with valganciclovir.

          7. Have all of the following results as part of screening laboratory assessments
             (results from either the central laboratory or a local laboratory can be used for
             qualification):

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mm3 [1.0 x 109/L]

               2. Platelet count ≥25,000/mm3 [25 x 109/L]

               3. Hemoglobin ≥8g/dL.

               4. Estimated creatinine clearance ≥60mL/min/1.73m2

          8. If females of child bearing potential, have a negative serum beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin (β- HCG) pregnancy test at screening. Sexually active females of child
             bearing potential must agree to comply with any applicable contraceptive requirements
             of the protocol. If male, must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control, as
             defined in the protocol, during the study treatment administration period and for 90
             days afterward the last dose of study treatment.

          9. Be able to swallow tablets.

         10. Have life expectancy of ≥ 8 weeks.

         11. Have weight ≥40 kg.

         12. Be willing and have an understanding and ability to fully comply with study
             procedures and restrictions defined in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have CMV tissue invasive disease as assessed by the investigator at the time of
             screening and randomization at Visit 2/Day 0.

          2. Have a CMV infection that is known to be genotypically resistant to ganciclovir,
             valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir based on documented evidence.

          3. Require ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir administration for
             conditions other than CMV when study treatment is initiated (example: herpes simplex
             virus [HSV] co-infection requiring use of any of these agents after the
             randomization) or would need a co-administration with maribavir for CMV infection.

          4. Be receiving leflunomide, or artesunate when study treatment is initiated. NOTE:
             Subjects who may be receiving leflunomide must discontinue the use at least 14 days
             prior to randomization at Visit 2/Day 0 and the first dose of study treatment.
             Subjects receiving artesunate must discontinue the use prior to the first dose of
             study treatment.

          5. Be on treatment with anti-CMV agents (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet or
             cidofovir) for the current CMV infection for longer than 72 hours. Note: Subjects who
             were administered these anti- CMV agents for prophylaxis, secondary prophylaxis, or
             treatment of prior infection, should have these treatments completed at least 2 weeks
             prior to the study entry or start of the treatment for current infection, whichever
             comes first and have undetectable CMV DNA (based on local laboratory) for at least
             two weeks between the completion of this treatment and onset of the current
             infection. Note: A subject who is receiving ganciclovir, valganciclovir, or foscarnet
             must discontinue their use before the first dose of study treatment. A subjects who
             may be receiving cidofovir must discontinue this antiviral at least 14 days prior to
             randomization at Visit 2/Day 0 and the first dose of study treatment.

          6. Have known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to an excipient of the study
             treatments.

          7. Have severe vomiting, diarrhea, or other severe gastrointestinal illness within 24
             hours prior to the first dose of study treatment that would preclude administration
             of oral medication.

          8. Require mechanical ventilation or vasopressors for hemodynamic support at the time of
             randomization.

          9. Be female and pregnant or nursing.

         10. Have previously completed, discontinued, or have been withdrawn from this study.

         11. Have received any investigational agent with known anti-CMV activity within 30 days
             before initiation of study treatment or investigational anti-CMV vaccine at any time.

         12. Have any clinically significant medical or surgical condition that, in the
             investigator's opinion, could interfere with interpretation of study results,
             contraindicate the administration of the assigned study treatment, or compromise the
             safety or well-being of the subject.

         13. Have previously received maribavir.

         14. Have serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) at
             screening, or serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;5 times ULN at screening, or
             total bilirubin ≥3.0 x ULN at screening (except for documented Gilbert's syndrome),
             as analyzed by local or central lab.

         15. Have positive results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Subjects must
             have a confirmed negative result within 3 months of study entry or be willing to be
             tested at screening. Local laboratory results are acceptable.

         16. Have active malignancy with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer, as determined
             by the investigator. Subjects who experience relapse or progression of their
             underlying malignancy (for which HSCT was performed), as determined by the
             investigator, are not to be enrolled.

         17. Be undergoing treatment for acute or chronic hepatitis C.
