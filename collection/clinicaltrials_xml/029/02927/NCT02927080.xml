  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study A083-02 is a multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ACE 083 in patients with FSHD
      to be conducted in two parts. Part 1 is open-label, dose-escalation and Part 2 is
      randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 (dose escalation, open-label) Part 1 will consist of up to 6 cohorts (A to F) of
      patients and will evaluate multiple ascending dose levels of ACE-083 in either the tibialis
      anterior (TA) or biceps brachii (BB) muscle. Patients in each cohort will be enrolled in a
      4-week screening period before beginning treatment. A Safety Review Team (SRT) will meet to
      review data for each cohort when at least 4 patients within a cohort have completed their
      Day 43 visit prior to dose escalation.

      Part 2 (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled) Prior to the initiation of Part 2, a
      review of safety and efficacy data from Part 1 will be conducted to determine whether
      cohorts for one or both muscles will be pursued in Part 2, as well as the recommended dose
      level for each muscle. A total of up to 40 new patients (20 patients per muscle) may be
      enrolled and randomized (3:2) to receive either ACE-083 (n=12) or placebo (n=8) unilaterally
      or bilaterally (if both sides are affected per inclusion criteria) to either the TA or BB
      muscles (but not both). The SRT will meet to review Part 2 patient safety data after the
      first 10 patients reach Day 43 in the study and approximately every 3 months thereafter.

      Study duration for Parts 1 and 2 for each patient will be approximately 24 weeks, including
      a 4-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and an 8-week follow-up period after
      the last dose
