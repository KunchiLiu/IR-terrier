  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare relapse-free survival (RFS) between subjects with
      FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) / internal tandem duplication (ITD) acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) in first complete remission (CR1) and who are randomized to receive gilteritinib or
      placebo beginning after completion of induction/consolidation chemotherapy for a two-year
      period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in CR1 will be approached for this study after induction/consolidation therapy is
      complete and a decision not to proceed with transplantation is made or a suitable donor
      could not be identified. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive gilteritinib
      or placebo. Subjects will enter the screening period up to 14 days prior to the start of
      treatment. Subjects will be administered treatment over continuous 28-day cycles. After
      treatment discontinuation, subjects will have a 30-day follow-up visit for safety, after
      which the subjects will enter the long-term follow up period for collection of subsequent
      AML treatment, remission status, and survival (cause of death and date of death).
      Gilteritinib or placebo will be given daily for up to 2 years. Subjects will be followed for
      up to 3 years from the subjects 30-day follow up, or until 80% of the subjects have an RFS
      event, whichever comes first. Study drug will not be provided during the follow-up period.
