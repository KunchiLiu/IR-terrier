    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with a
      diagnosis of NAFLD. Subjects will undergo Screening procedures during the 4 weeks preceding
      Baseline. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to oral doses of CF102 12.5 mg
      BID, CF102 25 mg BID, or matching placebo BID for 12 weeks using a stratified randomization,
      with stratification by presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. Subjects will be evaluated
      regularly for safety, and indicators of efficacy will be measured at Baseline and Week 12.
      Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 4 weeks after completion of the last dose of
      study drug.

         19. Any severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, may interfere with the informed consent process and/or with
             compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the investigator's opinion, would make the
             patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
