    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant and adjuvant
      atezolizumab in participants with Stage IB, II, or IIIA NSCLC who are eligible for surgical
      resection with curative intent. Neoadjuvant therapy will consist of two 21-day cycles with
      atezolizumab. Following surgery, adjuvant therapy will consist of up to 12 months of
      atezolizumab in participants who demonstrate clinical benefit with neoadjuvant therapy.
