    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) candidate vaccine when first administered via
      intramuscular (IM) injection according to a 0, 1-month schedule to RSV-seropositive infants
      aged 12 to 17 months.

             entering into the study.

          -  Seropositive for RSV as determined by IBL International kit.

          -  Born full-term with a minimum birth weight of 2.5 kg.

          -  Subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) need to have access to a consistent mean of telephone
             contact or computer.

          -  Child in care.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine

          -  Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make IM
             injection unsafe.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during
             the period starting six months prior to the first vaccine. For corticosteroids, this
             will mean prednisone, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs or planned administration at any
             time during the study period.

             starting three months before the first dose of study vaccine or planned
             administration during the study period.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol

             pediatric vaccines which may be administered ≥ 14 days before a dose or ≥ 7 days
             after a dose.

                  route, or ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F for rectal route. The preferred route for recording
                  temperature in this study will be axillary.

               -  Clinically significant upper respiratory tract infection

               -  Subjects with a minor illness without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion
