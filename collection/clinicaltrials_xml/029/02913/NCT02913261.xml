  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have undergone Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplanttaion (alloSCT) from any donor source
             (matched unrelated donor, sibling, haplo-identical) using bone marrow, peripheral
             blood stem cells, or cord blood. Recipients of non- myeloablative, myeloablative, and
             reduced intensity conditioning are eligible

          -  Clinically diagnosed Grades II to IV acute GvHD as per standard criteria occurring
             after alloSCT requiring systemic immune suppressive therapy. Biopsy of involved
             organs with aGvHD is encouraged but not required for study screening.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of steroid refractory aGvHD (confirmed within 48h prior to study
             treatment start) defined as patients administered high-dose systemic corticosteroids
             (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day [or equivalent prednisone dose 2.5 mg/kg/day]), given
             alone or combined with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and either:

               -  Progressing based on organ assessment after 5 days compared to organ stage at
                  the time of initiation of high-dose systemic corticosteroid +/- CNI for the
                  treatment of Grade II-IV aGvHD, OR

               -  Failure to achieve at a minimum partial response based on organ assessment after
                  7 days compared to organ stage at the time of initiation of high-dose systemic
                  corticosteroid +/- CNI for the treatment of Grade II-IV aGvHD,OR

               -  Patients who fail corticosteroid taper defined as fulfilling either one of the
                  following criteria:

          -  Requirement for an increase in the corticosteroid dose to methylprednisolone ≥2
             mg/kg/day (or equivalent prednisone dose ≥2.5 mg/kg/day) , OR

          -  Failure to taper the methylprednisolone dose to &lt;1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent
             prednisone dose &lt;1.25 mg/kg/day) for a minimum 7 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received more than one systemic treatment for aGvHD, other than corticosteroids
             +/- CNI (prophylaxis or treatment).

          -  Presence of an active uncontrolled infection including significant bacterial, fungal,
             viral or parasitic infection requiring treatment. Infections are considered
             controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of screening,
             no signs of progression are present. Progression of infection is defined as
             hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening physical
             signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without
             other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection.

          -  Evidence of active viral infection (confirmed by peripheral blood viral load)
             including Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Human Herpes Virus-6
             (HHV-6), Hepatitis Virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Patients with
             pre-transplant positive serology results indicative of high risk for viral
             reactivation must have negative viral load results within 28 days prior to
             randomization. Patients whose immune status is unknown or uncertain (e.g. serologies
             not obtained prior to transplant) must have viral load results confirming no evidence
             of active viral infection within 28 days prior to randomization.

          -  Presence of relapsed primary malignancy, or who have been treated for relapse after
             the alloHSCT was performed, or who may require rapid immune suppression withdrawal as
             pre-emergent treatment of early malignancy relapse.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
