    <description>Subjects assigned to this arm will be randomized to either 0.25% Timolol or 0.5% Timolol for 180 days. If during the 180 days the subject is considered a treatment failure, the subject will be unblinded. If the subject is on 0.25% timolol they will be changed to 0.5% timolol, if on 0.5% timolol the treating physician will decide to either continue 0.5% timolol or withdraw the subject and begin alternative treatment.</description>

             condition (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, adrenal insufficiency, upper airway obstruction,
             tetralogy of fallot (TOF), hypertension, reactive airways disease)

          3. IH that requires systemic therapy (defined by dynamic complication scale &gt;3)
