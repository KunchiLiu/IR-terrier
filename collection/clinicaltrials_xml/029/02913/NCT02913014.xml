  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if patients taking Anti Arrhythmia Drugs (AAD's) after
      cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation, compared to patients who do not take Anti-
      Arrhythmic Drugs after an ablation affect Atrial Fibrillation from coming back. The study
      will also look at the side effects of the AAD's.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is a cornerstone ablation strategy used in the management of
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and it is a class IA indication for anti-arrhythmic
      drug (AAD) refractory symptomatic PAF. However, the consensus statements are vague about the
      utility of AAD management during the 90-day blanking window post-PVI. Moreover, there is no
      specific guidance to cryoballoon users on the usage of AADs during the 90-day blanking
      period that exists anywhere in the published literature. Simply, these studies have not been
      conducted with the cryoballoon procedure.
