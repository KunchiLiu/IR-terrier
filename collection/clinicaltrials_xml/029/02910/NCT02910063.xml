  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2/3 open label, multicenter trial testing blinatumomab monotherapy for the
      treatment of subjects with Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) aggressive B-NHL not achieving CMR
      after 2 cycles of standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens administered as S1. This
      study incorporates multiple interim analyses for futility, efficacy, and unblinded
      sample-size re-estimation. In the phase 3 part of the study, blinatumomab will be compared
      to Investigator's Choice chemotherapy.

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS): calculated as the time from the date of randomization until the date of diagnosis of progression of lymphoma per central review, or date of death, whichever is earliest.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2 Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR): calculated only for subjects who achieve an objective response rate (ORR.) The duration will be calculated from the date a response, complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR), is first achieved until the earliest date of a disease assessment indicating a relapse event or death, whichever occurs first. Subjects who do not 2 Years have a relapse event will be censored on their last disease assessment date. If the last disease assessment date is after the date that triggers the analysis, the subject will be censored at the analysis trigger date. A sensitivity analysis will censor subjects who receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at the time of HSCT unless there is no assessment after the HSCT, in which case the last assessment prior to the HSCT will be used as the censoring time.</description>
