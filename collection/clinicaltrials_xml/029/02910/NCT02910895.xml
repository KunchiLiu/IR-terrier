  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outside the setting of well-designed prospective clinical studies, the current standard
      preoperative RT should be a conventionally 1,8-2 Gy fractionated regimen to a total dose of
      50 Gy in 5-6 weeks. However, given the vast diversity of sarcoma subtypes, it is also
      unlikely to assume a uniform radiotherapeutic management to be optimal for all sarcomas
      alike. Other than 2 Gy fraction sizes and/or 50 Gy total dose series have been investigated
      in the past and should be further exploited in the future, but the practical implementation
      in humans is hampered by the rarity of the disease. This platform may form the basis for
      preclinical radiotherapy investigations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed (non-)metastatic intermediate to high grade
             STS for which the patients is advised to undergo a combination of radiotherapy and
             surgery (e.g. deep seated, and/or &gt; 5cm according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria and/or
             grade II/III according to the FNCLCC definition)

          -  Local recurrences are allowed provided prior management was surgery alone

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

          -  Able and willing to undergo tumor biopsies

          -  Localization of sarcoma enables safe biopsy.

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ewing sarcoma and other PNET family tumours, rhabdomyosarcomas (both paediatric and
             adult), osteosarcomas

          -  Known coagulation disorder and/or anticoagulant medication in as far it might
             interfere with a safe biopsy procedure (to the discretion of the treating physician
             and attending radiologist).

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions
             should be discussed with the patient before registration in the study.
