             invasive CMV disease at Baseline as determined by the Investigator.

         12. Life expectancy of ≥ 8 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a current CMV infection that is considered refractory or resistant due to
             inadequate adherence to prior anti-CMV treatment, to the best knowledge of the
             Investigator.

          2. Requires ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir administration for
             conditions other than CMV when study treatment is initiated NOTE: A subject who is
             not continuing with the same anti-CMV drug(s) (ganciclovir, valganciclovir or
             foscarnet) for the study must discontinue their use before the first dose of study
             drug. If subject is currently receiving cidofovir and is assigned another anti-CMV
             agent by the investigator the subject must discontinue its use at least 14 days prior
             to randomization at Visit 2/Day 0 and the first dose of study treatment.

          3. Be receiving leflunomide, or artesunate when study treatment is initiated. NOTE:
             Subjects who may be receiving leflunomide must discontinue the use at least 14 days
             prior to randomization at Visit 2/Day 0 and the first dose of study treatment.

             study treatment.

          4. Have severe vomiting, diarrhea, or other severe gastrointestinal illness within 24
             hours prior to the first dose of study treatment that would preclude administration

             by local or central lab. Subjects with CMV hepatitis will not be excluded despite
             having &gt;5 times ULN at screening.

          8. Have positive results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subjects must have a

             before initiation of study treatment or investigational anti-CMV vaccine at any time.

         13. Have active malignancy with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Subjects who
             have had a HSCT and who experience relapse or progression of the malignancy as per
             investigator's opinion are not to be enrolled.

         14. Undergoing treatment for acute or chronic hepatitis C.

         15. Have any clinically significant medical or surgical condition that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, could interfere with the interpretation of study results,
             contraindicate the administration of the assigned study treatment, or compromise the
             safety or well-being of the subject.
