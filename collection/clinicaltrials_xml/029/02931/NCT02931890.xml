  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CRITICS-II trial aims to identify the optimal preoperative regimen in resectable gastric
      cancer by comparing three investigational treatment arms: chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy and
      subsequent chemoradiotherapy vs. chemoradiotherapy. The rationale behind this trial design
      is based on the following concepts:

        -  Preoperative treatment is associated with better patient compliance than postoperative
           regimens

        -  Preoperative treatment increases the likelihood of disease downsizing/downstaging and
           radical R0 resections

        -  Preoperative paclitaxel/carboplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy and DOC
           chemotherapy are effective, feasible and safe regimens
