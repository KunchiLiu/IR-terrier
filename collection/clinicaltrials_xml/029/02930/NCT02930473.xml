      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychotherapeutic intervention model in
      nursing for the nursing diagnosis &quot;Anxiety&quot;. A pilot randomised controlled trial will be
      carried out to testing procedures for their acceptability, estimating the likely rates of
      recruitment and retention of subjects, and the calculation of appropriate sample sizes.
      Moreover, this pilot study aims to test hypotheses.

      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychotherapeutic intervention model in
      nursing regarding nursing diagnosis &quot;Anxiety&quot; (according to International Classification for
      Nursing Practice (ICNP)/North American Nursing Diagnoses Association (NANDA) standardized
      nursing language). A pilot randomised controlled trial will be carried out to testing
      procedures for their acceptability, estimating the likely rates of recruitment and retention
      of subjects, and the calculation of appropriate sample sizes. Moreover, this pilot study
      aims to test hypotheses. In a double-blinded nurse-led 4 months controlled trial, conducted
      at a hospital outpatient setting in Portugal, 60 patients with anxiety will be randomised to
      the intervention (n=30) or control groups (n=30). The objective is to compare the outcomes
      associated with &quot;treatment as usual&quot; and the benefits of implementing the psychotherapeutic
      intervention model in nursing previously developed (5 sessions), which will be evaluated
      using Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) outcomes &quot;Anxiety Level&quot; and &quot;Anxiety
      Self-Control&quot; (Portuguese version).
