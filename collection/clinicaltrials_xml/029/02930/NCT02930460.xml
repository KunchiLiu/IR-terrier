      To characterize, in routine practice, non compliant patient to continuous positive airway
      pressure who can get a benefit of a bilevel positive airway pressure therapy as a second
      line treatment (Aircurve 10 VAutoTM ) To evaluate the clinical management of obstructive
      sleep apnea patients treated by Aircurve 10 VAutoTM , especially impact on compliance and
      residual apnea hypopnea Index.

      To evaluate Aircurve 10 VAutoTM benefit on quality of Life and quality of sleep
