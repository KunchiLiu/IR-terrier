      This trial will investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of talazoparib in patients
      with advanced solid tumors and impaired renal function.

      At the End of the Study, patients with no clinically significant toxicities, no
      contraindications to continue treatment with talazoparib, and no disease progression
      (underlying cancer progression) may be eligible to continue talazoparib treatment in a
      separate open-label extension study after discussion with the Principal Investigator and
      obtaining Sponsor permission. Sponsor decision to allow the patient to continue dosing with
      talazoparib in an open-label extension study will be based on potential overall
      benefit-risk, patient acceptance and other relevant criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated informed consent form (by the patient or a legally acceptable
             representative as per the local regulations) obtained prior to initiation of any
             study-specific procedure and treatment.

          2. Female or male of at least 18 years of age.

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor with no available
             standard approved treatment options in the opinion of the Investigator

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status (PS) ≤ 2.

          5. Expected life expectancy of ≥ 3 months.

          6. Able to swallow the study drug (no contra indication to oral agents).

          7. Renal function at screening and enrollment as defined by the Modification of Diet in
             Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.

          8. Patient has had no clinically significant change in renal status within 3 months
             prior to screening, according to Investigator's review of clinical patient records.

          9. Patient is not currently on hemodialysis and/or peritoneal dialysis for management of
             chronic kidney disease or acute failure/conditions.

         10. Patient has no unstable renal function, defined as a change in estimated glomerular
             filtration rate (eGFR) (calculated with the MDRD equation) of &gt; 25% for patients with
             mild and moderate renal impaired or as a change in eGFR &gt; 30% for patients with
             severe renal impaired, from screening to enrollment.

         11. Adequate other organ function at screening and enrollment.

         12. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             at screening, and must agree to use a highly effective birth control method from the

             drug.

             of previous anticancer standard or investigational therapy, except treatment-related
             alopecia or laboratory abnormalities otherwise meeting eligibility requirements.

          3. Major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment.

          4. Serious accompanying cardiac disorder.

          5. Active known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease

          6. Symptomatic or impending spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.

          7. Has undergone a liver transplant, kidney transplant or nephrectomy.

          8. Prior allergic reaction or severe intolerance (meeting the criteria for a serious
             adverse event, a grade 3 or 4 AE, or permanent treatment discontinuation) to a poly
             ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.

          9. Known myelodysplastic syndrome.

         10. Seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         11. Any serious or unstable medical condition that interferes with ability to tolerate
             treatment or assessments associated with the protocol.

         12. Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption.

         13. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the talazoparib capsule components.

         14. Any condition or reason that interferes with ability to participate in the study,
             tolerate treatment or assessments associated with the protocol, causes undue risk, or
