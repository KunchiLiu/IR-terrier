      The aim of this study is to evaluate concordance of T790M mutation plasma testing between
      the Cobas test and each of other platforms: Super-ARMS, digital PCR or NGS. And to assess
      the efficacy of AZD9291 monotherapy by assessment of PFS in adult patients with advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC, who have received prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and
      are T790M mutation positive detected by any one of the four plasma testing platforms:
      Cobas/Super-ARMS/ digital PCR/NGS.

      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate concordance of T790M mutation
      plasma testing between the Cobas test and each of other platforms: Super-ARMS, digital PCR
      or NGS. And to assess the efficacy of AZD9291 monotherapy by assessment of PFS in adult
      patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, who have received prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI) therapy and are T790M mutation positive detected by any one of the four
      plasma testing platforms: Cobas/Super-ARMS/ digital PCR/NGS.

      Study number of patients planned: Approximately 250 patients will be recruited in China.

      Study Design: This is an open-label, multi-center, real world testing and treatment study.

      Target patient population: 250 locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation positive NSCLC
      patients with progression on a previous EGFR-TKI will be recruited.

      Investigational product (IP), dosage, and mode of administration: AZD9291 is an oral,
      potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of both EGFR-TKI sensitising and resistance
      mutations in NSCLC with a significant selectivity margin over wild-type EGFR. AZD9291 will
      be administered orally as one 80 mg tablet once a day.

      Duration of IP administration: Patients may continue to receive AZD9291 as long as they
      continue to show clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator, and in the absence of
      discontinuation criteria. The study will be closed in a maximum period of 24 months after
      the last patient is enrolled. Contingencies will be made to ensure continued drug supply for
      patients who are still deriving benefit from AZD9291 at that time.

      Study measures: Data collected will include patient demographics, information needed to
      determine patient eligibility (including medical history, past and current disease
      characteristics, and tumor EGFR mutational status), AZD9291 exposure, investigator-reported
      efficacy (including tumor response and disease progression), overall survival (OS), and
      safety (including serious adverse events [SAEs], adverse events leading to dose
      modification, and adverse events of special interest [interstitial lung
      disease/pneumonitis-like events, and QTc prolongation events]).

      Statistical methods: The concordance of T790M resistance mutation testing between the Cobas
      test and each of other platforms will be calculated. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and
      NPV of each testing platform (Super-ARMS, digital PCR, and NGS) will be calculated with the
      Cobas test as the reference. The Kappa coefficient will be calculated to measure the
      agreement of T790M mutation testing between the Cobas test and each of other platforms.
      Descriptive statistics will be provided for all variables, as appropriate. Continuous
      variables will be summarized by the number of observations, mean, standard deviation,
      median, interquartile range (Q1, Q3), minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be
      summarized by frequency counts and percentages for each category. The 95% confidence
      interval (CI) will be calculated as appropriate. PFS and OS, respectively, will be
      summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the median time to event (progression and death)
      and quartiles together with their 95% confidence intervals.The chi-square test will be used
      to compare the sensitivity, specificity, and concordance between any of the two platforms
      using Cobas as reference testing in an exploratory manner.
