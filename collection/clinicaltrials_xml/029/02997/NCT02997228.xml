    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well combination chemotherapy, bevacizumab,
      and/or atezolizumab work in treating patients with microsatellite instability-high
      colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin calcium, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab and
      atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      combination chemotherapy, bevacizumab, and atezolizumab may work better in treating patients
      with colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy, based on progression-free survival (PFS), of fluorouracil,
      oxaliplatin, and leucovorin calcium (mFOLFOX6)/bevacizumab plus atezolizumab (combination)
      and atezolizumab (single agent) as compared to mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab (control).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the overall survival (OS). II. To compare the objective response rates (ORR)
      per RECIST 1.1. III. To determine the safety profiles of the combination of
      mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab/atezolizumab and atezolizumab monotherapy in patients with
      microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer (MSI-H mCRC).

      IV. To compare the surgical conversion rate. V. To compare disease control rate (complete
      response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) at 12 months.

      VI. To determine the duration of response and stable disease. VII. To compare the
      health-related quality of life and symptom burden.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To bank tissue and blood samples for other future correlative studies from patients
      enrolled on the study.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1,
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 of courses 1-10, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on
      day 1, and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 2 weeks for up to 48 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses with repeat
      every 2 weeks for up to 48 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients also received bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1, oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours on day 1 courses 1-10, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and
      fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
