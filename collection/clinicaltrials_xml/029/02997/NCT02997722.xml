    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the University of Mississippi's inpatient psychiatry unit for suicidal
      ideations will be given the opportunity to participate in the study. Within 24 hours of
      arriving to the inpatient psychiatric floor, patients who choose to participate will be
      randomized to receive either a placebo saline infusion or a ketamine infusion of 0.5 mg/kg
      over the course of 45 minutes. Infusions will take place in the University of Mississippi
      Medical Center's Post Anesthesia Care Unit and/or Short Stay Procedure Area. Patients will
      be monitored for 30 minutes after the completion of their infusion. The inpatient psychiatry
      team will assess all patients' suicidal ideations daily while they are inpatient at UMMC and
      the primary outcome will be the patient's inpatient hospital course length.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who agree to participate in this study will be enrolled within 24 hours of being
      admitted to the UMMC inpatient psychiatric service with suicidal ideations. After a member
      of the study team ensures that the patient understands the risks and benefits of
      participating versus not participating, the patient will be assigned, by chance, to one of
      the following groups:

        -  Group A: receives ketamine intravenous (IV) infusion over 45 minutes

        -  Group B: receives saline (salt solution) over 45 minutes

      The infusion will be administered in either the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) or Short
      Stay Procedure Area (SSPA). After receiving the infusion, the patient will be monitored for
      an additional 30 minutes by medical personnel in either the PACU or SSPA. This study will be
      a randomized, double blind cohort study, so neither the patient nor the study doctor will
      know which infusion is being administered. While receiving the infusion, the patient's vital
      signs (including heart rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and
      temperature) will be monitored on an anesthesia paper chart. After the patient is discharged
      from the hospital, the treatment team will analyze the patient's medical record and compare
      the length of hospital stay between the control and treatment groups. The only information
      about the patient's hospital stay that will be analyzed will be the length of hospital stay.

      If a patient is a woman of childbearing age, a urine pregnancy test will be performed after
      you agree to enroll in the study. The cost of this test will be covered by the University of
      Mississippi Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry. If you are found to be pregnant,
      you will not be able to participate in the study.

      Patients admitted after suicidal attempt may be enrolled in the study. Those who attempted
      suicide by medication overdose may participate in the study, but must be cleared by a
      medical toxicology specialist prior to enrollment. Due to cardiovascular adverse effects of
      ketamine, all participants will receive a 12-lead EKG to screen for cardiac arrhythmias. Any
      rhythm other than sinus rhythm will result in exclusion from the study.

      The patient's length of hospital stay will be recorded. Patients will be called at three and
      six months post-discharge to assess for any adverse events or medication reactions.
      Readmission rates will be assessed at six months post-discharge.
