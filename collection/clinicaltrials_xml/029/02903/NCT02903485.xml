  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate that presurgical assessement of patients' risk factors and
      surveillance during surgery, both performed by nurses, are not inferior to anesthetic team's
      care, concerning the rate of complications in cataract surgery with topical anesthesia.

      The nurse performs the triage of patients based on a chart of risk factors assessment. The
      triage, according to the presence or not of risk factors, leads to patients' care by an
      anesthetic team (medical anesthesist for pre-surgical assessement and anesthetic nurse for
      surveillance during surgery) or to patients' pre-surgical assessement and surveillance
      during surgery both performed only by nurses.

      In the control group, all patients are taken care of by an aesthetic team, with medical pre
      surgical assessement and surveillance during surgery both performed by anesthetic nurses.
