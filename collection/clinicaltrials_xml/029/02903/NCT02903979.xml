  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In front of a lack of evidence to determine the best treatment for deep cavitated carious
      lesions, the search for an effective restorative technique, which results in a least
      possible discomfort to patients, and reduce the time needed for the restorative treatment,
      if becomes relevant. The objective of this randomized clinical trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of high viscosity glass ionomer cement restorations (HVGIC) compared to indirect
      pulp capping with calcium hydroxide cement associated with high viscosity glass ionomer
      cement (HVGIC) for treatment of deep lesions in primary molars, as well as the impact of
      treatment on quality of life, cost of procedures, the perception of parents / carers,
      patients and operators, and satisfaction with the techniques evaluated. Children with 4 to 8
      years will be selected randomly at the Clinic for Children at the University Ibirapuera of
      Dentistry. 166 teeth will be randomized into two groups: (1) indirect pulp capping performed
      with calcium hydroxide cement, followed by restoration with HVGIC and (2) HVGIC restoration.
      The restorations will be evaluated after 6, 12 and 24 months by two trained examiners
      blinded to the treatments. The efficacy of each treatment is measured by four main outcomes,
      which are: (1) criteria related to the effectiveness of the restorative treatment with HVGIC
      compared to indirect pulp capping with calcium hydroxide cement, (2) criteria focused on the
      patient, (3) cost-effectiveness, (4) perception of parents and operators about the
      treatments. For comparison between the two groups will be used the Kaplan-Meier survival and
      the long-rank test. Cox regression is performed the assessment of the influence of some
      other variable results. For all analyzes, the significance level is set at 5%.
