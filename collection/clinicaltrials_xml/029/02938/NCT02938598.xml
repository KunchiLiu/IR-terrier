    <textblock>
      Mothers with symptoms suggesting clinical depression can be identified and potentially
      motivated to seek further care during pediatric visits for their young children. The best
      ways for pediatric providers to encourage mothers to seek further evaluation and treatment
      for their depressive symptoms are not known. The investigators plan to provisionally
      optimize a pediatric office-based intervention that we developed to motivate mothers who may
      be depressed to seek further care and, thereby to improve the well-being of women from
      diverse backgrounds and their children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression in mothers parenting young children is common and undertreated. Depression is
      debilitating for mothers, negatively affects their parenting, and is associated with mental,
      behavioral, and physical health problems in their children. Identifying and treating mothers
      with depression improves both the mothers' well-being and their children's mental and
      overall health. Pediatric visits offer a potential significant opportunity to intervene.
      Mothers may see their child's pediatric provider more often than their own, and these
      providers could motivate mothers to seek effective, underutilized, formal depression care,
      by communicating how recovery from depression is linked to child well-being.

      Therefore, in recent pilot work, the investigators developed a pediatric setting-based
      intervention that includes a validated maternal depression screen, and subsequent depression
      education and care-seeking motivational messages that emphasize the benefits of maternal
      depression care for children. Initial testing demonstrated that depression screen-positive
      mothers receiving the intervention had greater intention and attempts to seek depression
      care compared to mothers receiving usual care. The investigators then professionally
      translated the intervention into Spanish as a first step in increasing the generalizability
      of the intervention through refinement in future studies. As is often the case with
      interventions tested as a package, the investigators lack empirical evidence on which
      components of the pilot intervention deliver the greatest effects. Therefore, the
      investigators propose to adopt a rapid-cycle intervention improvement approach.

      In this trial, the investigators will assess the effects intervention refinements on
      depression screen-positive mothers' depression care-seeking, using a factorial randomized
      design. The resulting intervention will be provisionally optimized by including only those
      refined components found to be most experimentally efficacious. This provisionally optimized
      intervention will have a higher probability of demonstrating reproducible effectiveness,
      potentially speeding the way to implementation. The ultimate optimized intervention will
      improve maternal depression care by being an essential link in future integrated systems
      between pediatric-based maternal depression screening and effective community-based programs
      for maternal mental health care.
