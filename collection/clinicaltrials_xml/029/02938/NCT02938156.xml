  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe haemophilia A and B (SHA, SHB) are inherited bleeding disorders affecting male
      patients and are characterised by low levels of circulating clotting factors VIII and IX
      respectively. Clinically low levels present with multiple recurrent bleeds into joints and
      muscle from the first couple of years of life. In addition patients may present with
      spontaneous and potentially fatal bleeding into any organ. The mainstay of treatment is
      replacement with the missing factor in the form of intravenous injections of factor VIII and
      IX. Clotting factors can be given to treat a bleed or can be given to prevent a bleed, and
      the latter is termed prophylaxis. Regular prophylaxis is the current standard of care and
      aims to decrease spontaneous bleeding events and resulting joint damage, and this requires
      patients to self-infuse factor into their veins two to four times week. Patient's compliance
      with prescribed regimen and recommendations has a significant influence on outcomes.

      Advances in biomolecular and protein engineering have extended the duration of the effect of
      clotting factor VIII and IX through multiple mechanisms. This extension of the duration of
      the effect presents the clinician and patients with opportunities to tailor the treatment to
      their particular needs, circumstances and body other characteristics. It has been suggested
      that decreasing the frequency of infusions will improve adherence and thus contribute to
      improved outcomes.

      In rare disorders, it is an accepted fact that post-marketing studies are crucial to
      understand the generalisability of the efficacy and safety outcomes and identify any new
      safety and efficacy concerns in relation to specific population group. The investigators
      propose the development of a registry for systematic collection of information with the dual
      aim of analysing the relationship between patient and treatment characteristics, and
      outcomes, and simultaneously identify areas for practice development that can improve the
      overall quality of life experienced by the haemophilia patient community.
