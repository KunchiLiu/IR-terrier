      This study will be a cross sectional assessment of physical activity as measured through
      accelerometers and its association with endothelial function of children with Fontan
      circulation who are followed at the University of Alberta - Stollery Children's hospital.

    <description>To measure physical activity, participants will be asked to wear an Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers for seven consecutive days, during waking hours. A physical activity log will be provided to document the reason and time periods when the accelerometer is removed and will be cross-referenced with the accelerometer data.
To measure endothelial function, participants will undergo Digital Thermal Monitoring (DTM) via the automated, operator-independent protocol (VENDYS-6000, Endothelix Inc., Houston, TX). DTM is a non- invasive, operator-independent device that measures thermal recovery of the fingertip after 5 minutes of occlusion with a blood pressure cuff allowing quantification of endothelial reactivity.
Participants will complete a vascular health questionnaire to access factors that can affect endothelial function.</description>
