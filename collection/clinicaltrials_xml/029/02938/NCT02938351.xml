      The aims of the present study will be to pilot test the efficacy of a collaborative care
      intervention in patients treated with dialysis to reduce symptoms of depression, pain,
      sleep, fatigue and improve quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptom management is critical to maintain quality of life in those with life limiting
      conditions. Stepped collaborative care interventions have been widely employed in the
      primary care setting for the treatment of depression and more recently have been utilized to
      treat other symptoms (e.g., pain) in a variety of settings. A recent meta-analyses concluded
      that collaborative care interventions were superior to usual care and are more
      cost-effective than face to face and pharmacological treatment for depression. Collaborative
      care interventions have begun to be extended to other settings but have not been tested in
      patients who are being treated with dialysis for end stage renal disease. The aims of the
      present study were to pilot test the efficacy of a collaborative care intervention in
      patients treated with dialysis to reduce symptoms of depression, pain, insomnia, fatigue and
      improve quality of life.
