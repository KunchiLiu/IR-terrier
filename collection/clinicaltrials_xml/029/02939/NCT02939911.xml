  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residual neuromuscular blockade (RNB) is frequent and it is associated with postoperative
      morbidity and mortality. The incidence of the RNB in pediatric anesthesia is currently not
      known. The aim of this prospective observational cohort study is to evaluate the early RNB
      just before extubation and late RNB at the time of arrival to postanesthetic care unit
      (PACU).

    <textblock>
      Residual neuromuscular blockade (RNB) is frequent and it is associated with negative impact
      on postoperative morbidity and mortality. The incidence of the RNB in adult is well
      described, however in pediatric subpopulation it is currently not known. The aim of this
      prospective observational cohort study is to evaluate the early RNB just before extubation
      and late RNB at the time of arrival to postanesthetic care unit (PACU). In the trial will be
      enrolled all pediatric patients (28 weeks of age and older - 19 years old) whom will be
      administered neuromuscular blocking agent during anesthesia. The demographic data will be
      collected including: age, weight, type of surgery, ASA status. The anesthesia management
      will be described including: airway management, type and cumulative dose of neuromuscular
      blocking agent (NMBA) and time and dose of the last administered bolus of NMBA. The residual
      neuromuscular blockade will be measured according to the standards: TOF Watch accelerometry
      at the moment prior to extubation (two measurements) in TOF mode and at the arrival to
      postanesthetic care unit (PACU) (two measurements) in TOF mode.
