  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish the degree to which change in the ratio of ECF to TBW measured
      using the SOZO BIS device correlates with change in end-expiratory end-diastolic PAP
      measured using the CardioMEMS HF System (St. Jude Medical).

      This is a prospective, single-arm, observational, non-randomized clinical study that will
      enroll patients with heart failure who have had a CardioMEMS™ device implanted to monitor
      their diastolic pulmonary artery pressure. The study will recruit and enroll thirty
      participants. Participants will be monitored daily at home for a period of 30 days. Each
      day, the patient's diastolic pulmonary artery pressure will be measured by CardioMEMS™ and
      the ImpediMed's BIS technology. Participant's weight will also be taken each day.
