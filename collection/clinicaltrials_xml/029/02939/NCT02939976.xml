  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with partially blocked blood vessel(s) in their heart may need a medical procedure
      called &quot;Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)&quot; to open the narrowed blood vessel(s). The
      purpose of this study is to simultaneously address four potential advances in ST-Elevation
      Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) care for patients at least 65 years old. The investigators are
      looking to see if these advances can improve the outcome for these patients.

        1. Opening the arteries with a Medtronic stent

        2. Radial access (from wrist) success with a Medtronic stent

        3. Checking the percent of blockage in the diseased artery/arteries using Volcano guide
           wires.

        4. Reduced bleeding and vascular complications with radial arterial access for primary PCI
           in STEMI.

    <textblock>
      Multi-center, randomized, open-label, unblinded, active and historical-controlled trial in
      which approximately 1100 seniors undergoing urgent PCI from at least 70 centers will be
      enrolled. All consented subjects will undergo attempted radial arterial access.

      For Drug Eluting Stent (DES) eligible patients, after stable Thrombolysis In Myocardial
      Infarction risk score (TIMI)-3 flow is established in the Infarct Related Artery (IRA),
      patients without randomization exclusion criteria and multi-vessel disease will be
      randomized 1:1 to IRA-only revascularization or iFR-guided complete revascularization.

      After stent implantation, subjects will be contacted for follow-up at 30 days, 1 year, and
      18 months.

      Primary endpoint results will be reported after all subjects have completed 12 months of
      clinical follow-up.

      STEMI patients eligible for radial access:

        -  DES Eligible with single vessel Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) will receive DES to IRA

        -  DES Eligible with Multi-vessel CAD will randomize 1:1 to IRA-only revascularization or
           Instantaneous Wave Free Radio (iFR)-guided complete revascularization.

        -  Enrolled but subsequently determined to be DES ineligible will be followed in a
           parallel Base Metal Stent (BMS) Registry (up to 100 subjects)
