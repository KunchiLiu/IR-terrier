    <textblock>
      Stroke rehabilitation of hemiplegics primarily lies in motor control and training of
      activities of daily life. Whole body aerobics is much less emphasized. Nonetheless,
      cardiopulmonary fitness of even ambulatory hemiparetics is only half compared with healthy
      people, which is prone to deconditioning. The present study aims to understand the efficacy
      of aerobic training in addition to the usual neuro-rehabilitation, including aerobic
      fitness, daily activities dependency, anti-inflammation and anti-thrombosis. This is a
      prospective and randomized design. The subjects will be recruited from the hospitalized
      patients in the rehabilitation ward of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkuo. 120
      hemiplegic patients due to stroke will be enrolled and randomized into two groups: combined
      training (CT) and usual rehabilitation. Participants in CT will receive aerobics at moderate
      intensity in addition to the usual rehabilitation. The program has 35 minutes/session, 5
      sessions/week and 4-5 weeks in total. A constant-power semi-recumbent stepper will be
      employed as the training modality. It uses bilateral reciprocal movement of the arm coupled
      with the opposite leg, which allows for a push and pull motion. Additional 20 healthy
      participants will also be recruited as the healthy control. Assessment before and after
      training includes: (I) graded cardiopulmonary exercise test using constant-load stepper.
      (II) Functional Independence Measure. (III) coagulation system assessment, using Thrombin
      generation assay and Ceveron alpha (Technoclone GmbH, Vienna, Austria) : Von Willebrand
      factor, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, D-dimer, factor
      VIII, etc. [the 1st year]; (IV) monocyte-platelet aggregation and its subtypes, using flow
      cytometry [the 2nd year]. ( V) systemic inflammation, platelet activation and prognostic
      biomarker：C-reactive protein, soluble P-selectin, asymmetric dimethylarginine,
      Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2, etc [the 3rd year]. Statistical analysis will use
      ANOVA with post-hoc, two-way repeated measure ANOVA, etc. The investigation will start after
      approval and end in 2019, July. We hope this investigation will establish a more
      comprehensive rehabilitation program for clinical application.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, there are 220,00 stroke survivors and each year, 10,000 new suffers causing
      impairment in daily activities. This is the leading cause of disability and consumes 4.5
      billions of National Health Insurance yearly. More than half of them become hemi-paretics
      and hemi-plegics. Stroke leads to the adverse combination of reduced functional capacity and
      increased energy demands to perform routine activities Thereby, physiologic fitness reserve
      is diminished. Aerobic fitness is low in stroke survivors. Among ambulatory patients
      suffering from hemiparetic stroke, the VO2peak is approximately half that of age-matched
      individuals , a level that is near the minimum range required for activities of daily life.
      It may limit their ability to perform everyday activities and cause further complications,
      such as cardiopulmonary de-conditioning, muscular atrophy, joint stiffness, or even learned
      nonuse.

      Many patients are discharged from neurorehabilitation focusing on motor control and ADL
      (activity of daily life ) training, while aerobic fitness training is neglected, especially
      in non-ambulatory patients. Randomized exercise training studies using a wide variety of
      modalities and protocols have demonstrated an 8~23% improvement in VO2peak after 2-6 months
      of training . However, most research recruit patients with hemiparesis who have
      mild-to-moderate gait impairment . No specific training protocols has been adequately
      studied or can be suggested for hemiplegic patients. It is difficult for them to partake in
      aerobic exercise, like walking or biking. There is a need to develop a new aerobic exercise
      module suitable for the patients, especially for those with ambulation difficulty resulted
      from severe paralysis.

      In the current investigation, a semi-recumbent stepper with constant power design will be
      adopted as training modality. It accommodates motor function deficits by providing trunk and
      distal limb support . In addition, semi- recumbent stepper uses bilateral reciprocal
      movement of the arm coupled with the opposite leg, which allows for a push and pull motion.

      Aerobic fitness training has been proposed as a beneficial approach for people with stroke.
      Taking part in fitness training could have a range of other benefits important to people
      with stroke such as improving cognitive function, improving mood, and quality of life, and
      it could reduce the risk of recurrent stroke . In the present investigation, the outcome
      measurement will not only include cardiopulmonary fitness and the degree of daily activity
      dependency, but also prognostic biomarkers, thrombotic and inflammatory state.

      It is well-documented that exercise training has an anti-thrombotic effect . Increased
      physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with a reduced risk of
      fatality from cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, increased studies have demonstrated that
      regular moderate-intensity physical activity is associated with health benefits, even when
      aerobic fitness (e.g., maximal oxygen uptake, VO2max) remains unchanged . For sedentary
      persons at risk for cardiovascular disease, adopting a moderately active lifestyle can
      induce important health benefits, such as reducing prothrombotic factors and lipid
      peroxidation , increasing fibrinolytic activity and high-density lipoprotein levels , etc.
      One of the present investigation aims to understand whether 20~25 sessions of aerobic
      training at moderate intensity will induce these favorable adaptations that could contribute
      to decreased risk for ischemic event.

      This is a prospective randomized controlled study. Eighty stroke sufferers with unilateral
      weakness will be enrolled in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkuo. They will be randomized
      into two groups: combined training (CT) and usual rehabilitation (UR). Participants in the
      CT group will receive supervised aerobic training at moderate intensity in addition to usual
      neuro-rehabilitation, in which motor control and task-oriented ADL training are the major
      contents. Patients in the UR will undergo usual neuro-rehabilitation only. The aim of the
      present research is to evaluate the efficacy of an aerobic training program at moderate
      intensity for a total of 20~25 sessions using a semi-recumbent stepper with constant power
      design. Pre- and post-training measurement includes (I) cardiopulmonary fitness, (II) daily
      activities dependency, (III) coagulation and fibrinolysis profile. [the 1st year] (IV)
      monocyte subsets and its interaction with platelets [the 2nd year]. (V) Systemic
      inflammation, platelet activation and prognostic biomarker：C-reactive protein, soluble
      P-selectin, asymmetric dimethylarginine, Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2, etc. [the
      3rd year]. Venous blood will be sampled two times before and after rehabilitation.

      Hopefully, this clinical investigation will establish the model of incorporating aerobics in
      the hemiplegic patients following stroke, and its efficacy for clinical application.
