  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to understand the role of antitachycardia pacing (ATP) in primary
      prevention patients indicated for ICD therapy and programmed according to current guidance
      of higher rate cut-offs and therapy delays. The time to first all-cause shock will be tested
      in subjects with standard therapy (ATP and shocks) compared to subjects programmed to shock
      only to assess equivalency.
