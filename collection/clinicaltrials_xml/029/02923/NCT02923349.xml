        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Locally advanced or metastatic disease; locally advanced disease must not be amenable
             to resection with curative intent.

          -  Subjects who have disease progression after treatment with available therapies that
             are known to confer clinical benefit, or who are intolerant to treatment, or who
             refuse standard treatment. There is no limit to the number of prior treatment
             regimens.

          -  Part 1: Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

          -  Part 2: Subjects with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the endometrium,
             ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer.

          -  Presence of measureable disease based on RECIST v1.1.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Laboratory and medical history parameters not within the protocol-defined range.

          -  Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the
             protocol-defined intervals before the first administration of study drug.

          -  Has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 from toxic effects of prior therapy (including prior
             immunotherapy) and/or complications from prior surgical intervention before starting
             therapy.

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study drug.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past.
