    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety, anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of Enoblituzumab
      given before radical prostatectomy. All patients will receive Enoblituzumab for 6 weekly
      doses beginning 50 days prior to radical prostatectomy.

      This is a single-center, single arm, open-label pilot study evaluating the safety,
      anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant MGA271 given prior to radical
      prostatectomy in men with intermediate and high-risk localized prostate cancer. Patients
      will be recruited from the outpatient Urology clinic. Eligible patients will receive MGA271
      at a dose of 15mg/kg IV given weekly for 6 doses beginning 50 days prior to radical
      prostatectomy. 14 days after the last dose of MGA271, prostate glands will be harvested at
      the time of radical prostatectomy, and prostate tissue will be examined for the secondary
      endpoints. Follow-up evaluation for adverse events will occur 30 days and 90 days after
      surgery. Patients will then be followed by their urologists according to standard
      institutional practices, but will require PSA evaluations every 3 (±1) months during year 1
      and every 6 (±2) months during years 2-3.
