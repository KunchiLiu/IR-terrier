  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 parts. The phase 1b part will be an international, phase
      1b, open-label, dose-escalation assessment of radium-223 dichloride administered with
      bortezomib and dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma. The primary
      endpoint is to determine the optimal dose of radium-223 dichloride in combination with
      bortezomib/dexamethasone for the Phase 2 portion of the study.

      The phase 2 part will be an international, phase 2, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled assessment of radium-223 dichloride versus placebo administered with
      bortezomib and dexamethasone, in subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma.

      Up to approximately 30 total subjects in all dose cohorts combined will be treated in the
      phase 1b part of the study and approximately 196 subjects will be enrolled in the phase 2
      part of the study.
