    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and effectiveness of the WATCHMAN™ Left
      Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device, including the post-implant medication regimen, for
      subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are deemed not to be eligible for
      anti-coagulation therapy to reduce the risk of stroke.

    <textblock>
      The ASAP-TOO study is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, global investigation to
      establish the safety and effectiveness of the WATCHMAN Device for subjects with non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation who are deemed not suitable for anti-coagulation therapy to reduce the
      risk of stroke.

      Subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2 Device to 1 Control to receive the WATCHMAN LAA
      closure device (Device) or the control treatment of single antiplatelet medication or no
      medication at the discretion of the study physician (Control). All randomized subjects will
      follow the protocol required tests and assessments at each scheduled follow-up visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is of legal age to participate in the study per the laws of their
             respective geography.

          -  The subject has documented paroxysmal, persistent, permanent or
             long-term/longstanding persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation (i.e., the subject
             has not been diagnosed with rheumatic mitral valvular heart disease).

          -  The subject has a calculated CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater.

          -  The subject is deemed by two study physicians to be unsuitable for oral
             anticoagulation.

          -  The subject is deemed by a study physician to be suitable for the defined protocol
             pharmacologic regimen of aspirin and clopidogrel therapy following WATCHMAN Closure
             Device implant.

          -  The subject or legal representative is able to understand and willing to provide
             written informed consent to participate in the trial.

          -  The subject is able and willing to return for required follow-up visits and
             examinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is unable or unwilling to return for required follow-up visits and
             examinations.

          -  The subject had or is planning to have any invasive cardiac procedure within 30 days
             prior to randomization (e.g., cardioversion, ablation).

          -  The subject is planning to have any cardiac or non-cardiac invasive or surgical
             procedure that would necessitate stopping or modifying the protocol required
             medication regimen within 90 days after the WATCHMAN Closure Device implant (e.g.,
             cardioversion, ablation, cataract surgery).

          -  The subject had a prior stroke (of any cause) or TIA within the 30 days prior to
             randomization.

          -  The subject had a prior BARC type 3 or 4 bleeding event within the 14 days prior to
             randomization. Lack of resolution of related clinical sequelae, or planned and
             pending interventions to resolve bleeding/bleeding source, are a further exclusion
             regardless of timing of the bleeding event.

          -  The subject has a history of atrial septal repair or has an ASD/PFO device.

          -  The subject has an implanted mechanical valve prosthesis in any position.

          -  The subject suffers from New York Heart Association Class IV Congestive Heart
             Failure.

          -  The subject has LVEF &lt; 30%.

          -  The subject is of childbearing potential and is, or plans to become pregnant during
             the time of the study (method of assessment upon study physician's discretion).

          -  The subject is currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
             would directly interfere with the current study, except when the subject is
             participating in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational
             registry with no associated treatments. Each instance should be brought to the
             attention of the sponsor to determine eligibility.

          -  The subject has a life expectancy of less than two years.

          -  The subject has a known or suspected hypercoagulable state.
