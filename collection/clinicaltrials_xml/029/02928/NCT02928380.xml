  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study, an experimental denture adhesive with a precision tip nozzle will be
      tested to evaluate the relative efficacy to reduce the ingress of food under the denture
      compared to use of no adhesive or a standard marketed adhesive.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the mass of food particle ingress when an adhesive is
      extruded through the new nozzle with directed application compared to the use of no adhesive
      and a marketed adhesive (extruded through a flat ribbon nozzle [FRN]) with standard
      application as per product label, utilizing a peanut occlusion methodology. This will be a
      single center, controlled, single blind (to the examiner performing the safety assessments
      (oral soft tissue [OST] examination) and the laboratory staff weighing the peanut
      particles), randomized, three-treatment, three-period, cross-over design in participants
      with full upper and lower dentures. Each treatment period will consist of one day of testing
      with at least two days between treatment visits. This study will consist four visits: Visit
      1 - Screening Visit; Visit 2 - Treatment 1 Visit; Visit 3 - Treatment 2 Visit and Visit 4 -
      Treatment 3 Visit.

    <description>Combined mass of peanuts or food occlusion will be measured by mass of food particles (mass of retrieved peanuts from each denture) to assess the performance of an experimental denture adhesive with a precision nozzle compared to a marketed denture adhesive with a flat ribbon nozzle in a model for food occlusion.</description>

    <measure>Kapur (Olshan Modification) Index Scores for Denture Retention and Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 54 days</time_frame>
    <description>Kapur (Olshan modification) Index scores will be assessed to examine each denture (upper and lower) for retention and stability. Retention will be measured using score of 0-5 to assess the nature of resistance offered by denture to vertical pull &amp; lateral force: 5=Excellent; 4=Very Good; 3=Good;2=Fair; 1= Poor; 0= No retention. Stability will be measured using score of 0-4: 4= Excellent-when denture base offers no rocking on its supporting structures under pressure; 3=Good-when denture base has very slight rocking on its supporting structures under pressure;2=Fair-when denture base has slight rocking on its supporting structures under pressure;1= Poor-when denture base has moderate rocking on its supporting structures under pressure;0= No stability- when denture base has extreme rocking under pressure. Sum of scores(upper+lower dentures) will show retention &amp; stability of denture as follows:&lt;6 =poor retention;6-9 =fair retention;10-14 =good retention; &gt;14-=very good retention.</description>
