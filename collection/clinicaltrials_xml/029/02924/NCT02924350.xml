    <time_frame>3 days post product use</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner will indicate the participant's response to the evaporative air stimulus, after the stimulation of each individual tooth, using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale as follows: 0=Participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1=Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2=Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus, 3=Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and requests discontinuation of the stimulus.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in tactile threshold after 3 days use</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days post product use</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner will assess the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allows the application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10gram (g) and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force is reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth is determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses is recorded as the tactile threshold. Higher tactile threshold means less sensitive tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used will be 20g; at all subsequent visits, it will be 80g.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Schiff sensitivity score after a single 60 second direct application</measure>
