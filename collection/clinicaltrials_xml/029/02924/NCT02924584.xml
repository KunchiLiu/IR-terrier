  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Taiwanese women. Most of them were diagnosed in
      relatively early stages. Only 700 metastatic breast cancer were registered in Official
      Cancer Registration 2012, while more than11,305 were registered as early breast cancer. With
      broadly application of aromatase inhibitors, hormonal-receptor-positive breast cancer
      patients can survive longer and longer. However, there is no prevalence of metastatic breast
      cancer can be available yet. NHIA database coverage is more than 90% population in Taiwan,
      thus it can be an appropriate surrogate of prevalence. In this retrospective database
      analysis, we will explore the real world experience on aromatase inhibitor use for breast
      cancer in Taiwan.
