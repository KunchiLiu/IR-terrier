      For therapy of symptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) in subjects with
      structural heart disease the current European Guidelines for the management of patients with
      ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of second cardiac death recommend catheter
      ablation as well as amiodarone with a class IIa indication. Due to the lack of randomized
      data this study investigates the comparison of catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drug
      therapy for PVC treatment in patients with structural heart disease. Therefore, patients
      will be randomized to one of two treatment strategies: 1) catheter ablation, or 2)
      antiarrhythmic drug therapy (amiodarone, flecainide/propafenone if compatible with
      underlying heart disease).

      Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are frequently encountered in patients with or
      without structural heart disease. Even though PVCs in healthy subjects are considered to be
      a benign arrhythmia. There is also evidence for the risk of a reversible cardiomyopathy due
      to the PVC-induced inter- and intraventricular dyssynchrony. Data show that elimination of
      PVCs by catheter ablation leads to an improvement of left ventricular dysfunction. In
      one-half of the heart failure patients frequent PVCs occur with more than 1000/24 h. In
      patients with structural heart disease premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) lead to an
      increased mortality risk with only a burden of 10 PVC per hour. Further decreasing of left
      ventricular function and worsening of heart failure are described. Therefore, therapy of
      frequent monomorphic PVCs is recommended in these subjects. Beta-blockers as part of
      standard therapy often remain ineffective or may lead to a paradoxic effect in patients with
      bradycardia. A limiting factor for selection of antiarrhythmic drug due to increasing
      mortality is the presence of structural heart disease. So in the most cases amiodarone is
      indicated. There are data showing improvement of LV function after suppression of PVCs by
      amiodarone with a significant 75% reduction from baseline. However, the adverse effects of
      amiodarone are well-known especially in long-term therapy. On the other hand, radiofrequency
      catheter ablation is a widely applied and safe treatment option for PVCs with a high acute
      success rate of up to 90% PVC reduction in various circumstances like pre-existing heart
      failure and post myocardial infarction subjects. Some small-sample studies show the benefit
      of catheter ablation in subjects with depressed LV function. To date, there are no
      randomized data for comparison of catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs for therapy of
      PVCs in patients with structural heart disease.
