    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of niraparib when
      administered in combination with apalutamide in men with metastatic castration resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) who may or may not have deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-repair
      anomalies.

    <description>Participants will receive initial starting dose of niraparib 200 milligram (mg) once daily in combination with apalutamide 240 mg (4*60 mg) once daily in dose selection phase (Part 1) of the study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of niraparib, followed by a dose expansion phase (Part 2) study to further explore safety and assess antitumor activity of the combination niraparib and apalutamide. Part 1 comprise a standard 3+3 dose selection phase for dose escalation to 300 mg (the maximum dose), or de-escalation to 100 mg niraparib (the minimum dose).</description>
