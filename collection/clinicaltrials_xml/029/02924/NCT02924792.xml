      In this study we investigate the impact of two CE marked and FDA approved sternal needles in
      comparison to intravenous access on the flow-rate of autologous reinfusion of whole blood
      and the possible hemolysis of red cells post-transfusion in a population of healthy military
      officers.

    <textblock>
      Intraosseous (IO) access is an old technique for achieving entrance to the systemic
      circulation, which has gained resurgence in the last 30 years.

      Whether due to trauma or disease, vascular collapse may delay or preclude even experienced
      medical providers from obtaining standard intravenous (IV) access. Access to the vascular
      system of the critically ill or injured adult or pediatric patient is essential for
      resuscitation, and flow rates close up to what can be obtained by using intravenous access
      is preferable in patient needing immediate fluid boluses for shock resuscitation.
      Intraosseous access takes advantage of the vascularity of cancellous bone, the spongy bone
      inside the hard, and access to the highly vascular intramedullary space of bones provides a
      direct link to central circulation. In addition to using long bones, the sternum is used for
      intraosseous access and has gained increased use especially in combat casualty care.

      However, in a recent publication, the intraosseous route used for transfusion of blood
      components is questioned. Based on theoretical models for flow rates through porous media
      and personal clinical observations the authors conclude that the maximum flow rates
      attainable for transfusion of blood via intraosseous route are inadequate for successful
      resuscitation. They also fear that additional pressure needed to obtain adequate flow rate
      may cause hemolysis of red blood cells. Further they postulate that as the bone mineral
      density reaches a peak occurring in the early 20s, and that a small increase in bone density
      may cause exponential decrease in intrinsic permeability, there could be a 10-fold decrease
      in permeability in military age causalities compared to the elderly. The critical points
      highlighted in this review are in great contrast to recent experience with the use of
      sternal and humeral I.O`s in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).

      In this observational study we investigate the impact of two CE marked and FDA approved
      sternal needles in comparison to intravenous access on the flow-rate of autologous
      reinfusion of whole blood and the possible hemolysis of red cells post-transfusion in a
      population of healthy military officers. We also investigate the technical success rate of
      sternal IO Access between two CE marked and FDA approved sternal Devices. As a supplementary
      investigation we seek to investigate the anatomic changes as shown by Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging in individuals who have received multiple intraosseous sternal needles With
      autologous reinfusion of whole blood.
