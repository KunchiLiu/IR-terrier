  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy eating can be difficult for people who live in poor, geographically isolated regions
      of the United States. In particular, people who live in Appalachia often experience food
      insecurity (i.e., their access to adequate food is limited by a lack of money and other
      resources at times during the year) and lack of access to healthy foods. This pilot study
      evaluates the effectiveness of motivational interviewing in helping individuals who live in
      these austere regions improve their diets in the context of limited resources and healthy
      food availability

      Participants in three of the counties will receive an education/skills intervention paired
      with a form of coaching called motivational interviewing conducted by a trained registered
      nurse. Three similar counties that do not border any of the intervention counties are
      serving as controls (these counties receive the same nutrition education/skills intervention
      without motivational interviewing). All participants will receive cookbooks, cooking
      classes, food preparation tools and prepared food dishes to take home to their families. The
      investigators will measure the impact of motivational interviewing on fresh fruit and
      vegetable consumption, saturated fat consumption and number of meals cooked at home.
