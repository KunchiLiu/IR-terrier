  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      India has the world's highest prevalence of diabetes, expected to rise to 80 million by
      2030. This includes many patients with lean diabetes, with low body mass index (BMI) and
      severe complications of diabetes. Despite its prevalence in India and other countries and
      its dire health consequences to individuals with the disease, little is known about the
      aetiopathogenesis and the genotype-phenotype relationship, lean diabetes being a cluster of
      low birth weight individuals, MODY, lipododystrophic disease, type 1 diabetes and
      fibrocalcific disease. While rudimentary tests have suggested defects in both insulin
      secretion and action, no comprehensive metabolic studies have been performed. It is
      therefore unclear as to how these patients should be treated. The optimal therapeutic
      adjunct whether a suitable oralantidiabetic agent or insulin is not yet determined. Defining
      the metabolic defects of 'lean' diabetes should have tremendous therapeutic benefit for
      millions of patients with this elusive condition.

        The subjects with diabetes will be recruited from the community as well as from the
        outpatient diabetes practice at CMC India, Jacobi Medical Center and North Central Bronx
        hospital. Subjects with diabetes mellitus will meet the following criteria: ages 19-45
        years, diabetes duration at least one year, negative GAD antibodies, present (&gt;1.0 pmol/l)
        C-peptide response to Sustacal challenge, stable and moderate-to-poor glycemic control
        (HbA1c between 8 and 11%), with no pancreatic calcification on imaging, and not suffering
        from significant complications. Diabetic subjects will be otherwise in good health.

        Nondiabetic with BMI 16-22.5 kg/m2 subjects 19-45 years of age and in general good health,
        taking no medications, with normal glucose tolerance and no family history of diabetes.
        These subjects will be similar in age, ethnicity and BMI with the lean DM group, and will
        be recruited through various means of community outreach, including notices in shops and
        newspapers.
