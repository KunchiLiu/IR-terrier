  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a laboratory-based hypnosis session on
      peripheral blood flow, autonomic stress responses, and acute pain responses in adolescents
      (ages 12-18) with sickle cell disease and healthy controls, and examine how perceived
      disease-related stigma may affect these responses.

    <description>Stigma will be assessed via a questionnaire completed prior to the start of the laboratory session and will be compared to the and the change in effect, which is assessed by comparing levels of blood flow during the pre-hypnosis period (15 minutes prior to hypnosis to a minute before the start of hypnosis) from blood flow during the hypnosis period (from the start of hypnosis until 30 minutes after the start of hypnosis).</description>
