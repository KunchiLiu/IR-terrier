    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of a clinical informatics system-based approach to lung
      cancer screening. Patients of a large academic medical center who may qualify for lung
      cancer screening will be sent an electronic invitation to complete an online lung cancer
      screening decision aid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) recently approved the use of low-dose
      chest CT scans for lung cancer screening in patients who meet specific criteria. However,
      many individuals who meet these criteria do not realize they qualify for screening. This
      study will determine the feasibility of using a clinical informatics approach to
      systematically identify potential candidates for LDCT screening, reach out to them via the
      patient portal, and use a web app to provide them with a personalized LDCT screening
      decision aid and facilitate the ordering of screening tests.
