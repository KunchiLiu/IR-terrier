      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety in patients with TSC and
      refractory seizures who are currently receiving everolimus treatment in the
      Novartis-sponsored EXIST-3 study and who are determined to be benefiting from continued
      treatment as judged by the investigator at the completion of EXIST-3

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label study to evaluate the long term safety of everolimus in
      patients with TSC and refractory seizures currently being treated in the Novartis-sponsored
      study EXIST-3 study and are judged by their parent study investigator as benefiting from the
      current study treatment. The study is expected to remain open for approximately 10 years (or
      until 31-Dec-2022 in the UK) from First Patient First Visit (FPFV).

      Patients will continue to be treated in this study until they are no longer benefiting from
      their everolimus treatment as judged by the Investigator or until one of the protocol
      defined discontinuation criteria is met or everolimus becomes commercially available
      according to local regulations.
