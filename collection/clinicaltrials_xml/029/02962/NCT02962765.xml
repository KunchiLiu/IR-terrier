    <textblock>
      Prospective, multinational, non-interventional post-authorisation study to collect
      additional clinical data and to ensure consistency in the long-term between the outcome from
      pre-authorisation clinical studies (in 135 previously treated paediatric and adult patients)
      and routine clinical practice. Besides aspects such as general product safety and efficacy,
      there will be a focus on immunogenicity, particularly on inhibitor development. The
      diagnosis of FVIII inhibitor will be based on clinical observations and confirmed by FVIII
      inhibitor testing in the laboratory.

        The goal is to collect data on 200 previously treated male patients of any age with
        haemophilia (FVIII:C ≤ 2%). Patients from pre-authorisation studies can be followed up to
        at least 100 EDs. Newly enrolled patients have to be treated and followed for at least 100
        EDs.

          -  Of the 200 enrolled patients, at least 100 patients should have severe haemophilia A
             (FVIII:C &lt; 1%).

          -  Of the 200 enrolled patients, approx. 60 patients should be &lt; 12 years of age. At
             least 10 patients should be aged between 14-18 years.

          -  Patients with severe haemophilia A after successful immune tolerance induction (ITI)
             can also be included; the proportion of these ITI patients should not exceed 25% of
             the entire cohort.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Haemophilia A (FVIII:C ≤ 2%) based on medical history; at least 100 patients should
             have severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C &lt; 1%)

          -  Male patients of any age

          -  Previous treatment with a FVIII concentrate for more than 150 EDs

          -  Availability of detailed documentation (patient diary, log book, etc.) covering
             either the last 50 EDs or the last 2 years per patient to confirm treatment modality
             (i.e., prophylaxis, on-demand, recent surgery, or immune tolerance induction)

          -  Inhibitor negative (&lt; 0.6 BU) at study entry as confirmed by a recovery test with
             previous FVIII product and inhibitor test in a central laboratory

          -  Immunocompetence (CD4+ count &gt; 200/µL), HIV-negative, or having a viral load &lt; 200
             particles/µL or &lt; 400,000 copies/mL

          -  Decision to prescribe Human-cl rhFVIII before enrolment into the study

          -  Written informed consent by the patient or the patient's parent or legal guardian

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients treated with any investigational medicinal product (IMP) except FVIII IMP
             within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit or patients planning to undergo treatment
             with any IMP other than Human-cl rhFVIII are not eligible for enrolment into the
             study.
