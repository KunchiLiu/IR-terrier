  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to test a personalized mHealth intervention designed
      to increase physical activity and improve medication adherence in subjects with heart
      failure and diabetes mellitus. The study will leverage consumer technology as both an
      intervention and as a tool for data collection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center randomized controlled study in eligible subjects with heart failure
      and diabetes mellitus. Step counts, self-reported quality of life, medication adherence,
      blood samples and relevant clinical measures will be collected from all study subjects. The
      mobile health (mHealth) intervention will combine personalized text messages to encourage
      physical activity and a medication adherence teaching tool. A total of approximately 200
      eligible subjects will be randomized in in a 1:1 ratio to either mHealth intervention +
      usual care/data collection or the control group (usual care/data collection only). The study
      duration is 6 months for all subjects; those in the intervention group will receive the
      mHealth intervention during the initial 3 months followed by 3 months of data collection
      only. The underlying hypotheses is that the proposed mHealth intervention can favorably
      impact specific health behaviors (physical activity and medication adherence) and
      physiologic measures of disease status for both heart failure and diabetes. Additional
      hypotheses to be tested will assess the persistence of behavioral changes (daily physical
      activity and medication adherence) and physiologic measures (NT-proBNP, HbA1c) beyond the
      3-month time point of the active mHealth intervention (i.e. through 6 months).
