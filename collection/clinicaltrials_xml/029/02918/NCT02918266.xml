  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a single oral dose of TAK-071 on the
      attenuation of cognitive deficit induced by scopolamine as measured by Groton Maze Learning
      Test (GMLT) (total number of errors).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-071. This study will look at the effect of
      a single oral dose of TAK-071, a novel muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 positive
      allosteric modulator, on scopolamine-induced deficits in cognitive function in healthy adult
      male participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 32 participants, with the total of 8 participants per
      sequence. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four treatment
      sequences—which will remain undisclosed to the participants and study doctor during the
      study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Scopolamine;TAK-071+Scopolamine;Placebo;Donepezil+Scopolamine

        -  TAK-071+Scopolamine;Donepezil+Scopolamine;Scopolamine;Placebo

        -  Donepezil+Scopolamine;Placebo;TAK-071+Scopolamine;Scopolamine

        -  Placebo;Scopolamine;Donepezil+Scopolamine;TAK-071+Scopolamine

      The dose of TAK-071 that was well-tolerated in the TAK-071-1001 study (NCT02769065) will be
      selected, based on the safety and tolerability data from the single-rising dose (SRD) study.
      Each participant will also receive scopolamine 0.5 mg, injection, subcutaneously, once at
      the time of Screening.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 18 weeks. Participants will remain confined to
      the clinic for 4 days during the each intervention period. Participants will be contacted by
      telephone on Day 72 for a follow-up assessment.
