  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is aimed to assess the implementation, effectiveness, and
      sustainability of a pediatric-based intervention aimed at reducing families' unmet material
      needs (food, housing, employment, childcare, household heat, education) in pediatric
      practices throughout the United States.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators prior work has focused on developing a pediatric primary care-based
      intervention, &quot;WE CARE (Well-child care visit, Evaluation, Community Resources, Advocacy,
      Referral, Education),&quot; aimed at addressing poor families' material needs - food security,
      employment, parental education, housing stability, household heat, and childcare - by
      systematically screening for these needs and referring families to existing community-based
      services. To date, the investigators have tested WE CARE primarily in community health
      centers (CHCs); their RCT demonstrated WE CARE's efficacy on parental receipt of
      community-based resources. However, over 80% of low-income children receive care from
      providers in traditional pediatric practices (i.e. non-CHCs). The investigators therefore
      will conduct a large-scale, Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial in twenty eight
      pediatric practices in the US. A stepped wedge study cluster RCT design will be used to
      implement WE CARE in all practices using two common strategies used to integrate
      systems-based interventions into primary care - a previously facilitated &quot;on-site&quot; strategy
      in which content experts provide training sessions and on-going consultation; and a
      self-directed &quot;web-based&quot; method modeled after the American Academy of Pediatrics' practice
      transformation strategy. The proposed study's specific aims are to: 1) demonstrate the
      non-inferiority of the self-directed, web-based strategy for implementing WE CARE, in
      comparison to the facilitated on-site strategy; 2) demonstrate WE CARE's effectiveness on
      increasing parental receipt of community resources; and 3) assess the sustainability of WE
      CARE in pediatric practices. The investigators hypothesize that WE CARE will have equivalent
      fidelity via the two strategies. Based on prior work, the investigators hypothesize that WE
      CARE will significantly increase parental receipt of community resources six months
      post-visit compared to usual care. The investigators also expect WE CARE to be sustained 1-,
      2-, and 3-years post-implementation; they expect to gather data from over 9,000 chart
      reviews, 2,800 parent-child dyads, and 150 providers and office staff. This proposal has
      significant public health implications for the delivery of primary care to low-income
      children.

    <description>The WE CARE survey consists of 12 questions used to identify six unmet material needs (education, employment, food security, housing, childcare, household heat). It will be administered at health supervision visits during the WE CARE phase at each study site. The Family Resource Book will contain resource information sheets for each of these needs listing available community resources. A physician champion will conduct regular booster sessions every 4 months and train new providers should there be staff turnover.</description>
