  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An online decision support tool will be field tested that provides patients facing a
      decision about contralateral prophylactic breast cancer (CPM) with evidence-based
      information about the expected incidence of contralateral breast cancer and the life
      expectancy benefit of CPM. The tool will be designed for use in clinical settings and viewed
      jointly by the patient and physician as part of a shared decision making process around CPM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants will be recruited at their initial surgeon's appointment at MD
      Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). For K-S site, potential participants will be recruited at
      their initial surgeon's visit if the patient is coming in with a known breast cancer
      diagnosis. Eligible participants' surgical treatment preferences will be assessed prior to
      meeting with the surgeon including level of interest in having CPM (i.e., no interest in CPM
      to definitely interested in having CPM). If the participant selects 3 or higher for interest
      in CPM (where 1 indicates no interest in CPM and 5 indicates definite interest in CPM),
      patient will be invited to participate on the study. Five breast cancer surgeons will be
      invited to participate in the study and each will be asked to field test the decision tool
      on 5 eligible patients who are considering CPM.

      The patients' acceptability and the effectiveness of the decision support tool will be
      assessing using questionnaires before and after the patient participates in the consultation
      with her breast cancer surgeon. Patients' rating of the acceptability of the decision
      support tool will be assessed using questions from the Ottawa Acceptability Measures,
      including the clarity, amount, and balance of the information provided by the tool (2). The
      effectiveness of the decision support tool will be assessed by the following measures
      administered before and after the consultation: 1) changes in patient's knowledge of CPM and
      2) reductions in decisional conflict about CPM using the Decisional Conflict Scale (3)
      Patients will also be asked their preferences for CPM after the consultation.

    <description>Participant with early stage breast cancer complete a brief questionnaire before and after her surgeon shows her the clinical tool.

Patient's participation and completion of the questionnaires will assist researchers in learning about the acceptability of the clinical tool, and whether it helped participant make decisions and improved their knowledge on the topic.</description>
