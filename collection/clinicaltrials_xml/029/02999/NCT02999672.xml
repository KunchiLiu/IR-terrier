  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, non-randomized, Phase II, single agent study will assess the efficacy, and
      safety of trastuzumab emtansine in participants with HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry
      [IHC]3+ in greater than or equal to [&gt;/=] 30 percent [%] of tumor cells) locally advanced or
      metastatic UBC or metastatic pancreas/cholangio cancer. Participants must have received at
      least one prior (for bladder cancer platinum-based) treatment for inoperable, locally
      advanced or metastatic tumor. Participants will receive intravenous (IV) infusion (infusion
      duration=90 minutes [mins]) of trastuzumab emtansine until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal
      of consent, disease progression (PD), or death, whichever occurs first.
