      Cancer patients are presented with a lot of information about their diagnosis and different
      treatment options, which can be confusing. The purpose of this study is to see if a simple
      video explanation of six words used to describe cancer treatment improves patient
      understanding of these words.

      Cancer patients are presented with a lot of information about their diagnosis and different
      treatment options, which can be confusing. The purpose of this study is to see if a simple
      video explanation of six words used to describe cancer treatment improves patient
      understanding of these words.

      Participants will be interviewed and asked the meaning of six words related to cancer
      treatment. Following the interview, participants will be shown a video about the meaning of
      the words. After viewing the video, participants will be re-interviewed to test how
      effective the video was at explaining the six words.
