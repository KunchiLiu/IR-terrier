      The aim of the current study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib over 52
      weeks in patients with Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (PF-ILD) defined as
      patients who present with features of diffuse fibrosing lung disease of &gt;10% extent on
      high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and whose lung function and respiratory symptoms
      or chest imaging have worsened despite treatment with unapproved medications used in
      clinical practice to treat ILD. There is currently no efficacious treatment available for
      PF-ILD. Based on its efficacy and safety in Idiopatic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), it is
      anticipated that Nintedanib will be a new treatment option for patients with PF-ILD.

             re-tested (once) if it is thought to be a measurement error (i.e. there was no
             abnormal result of this test in the recent history of the patient and there is no
