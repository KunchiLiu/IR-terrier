      To conduct a pilot test to estimate the effect of a novel reminder system in improving daily
      asthma controller medication adherence rates in children with monolingual Spanish-speaking
      guardians who have limited English Proficiency (LEP).

      The primary hypothesis is to conduct a pilot test to estimate the effect of the SmartInhaler
      device in improving daily asthma controller medication adherence rates in children with
      monolingual Spanish- speaking guardians who have LEP during a six-week intervention period
      when compared to baseline medication adherence rates in a preceding six-week run-in period.
      The secondary hypothesis is to determine whether the patient reminder system can improve
      asthma symptom control during the same six-week intervention period. The third hypothesis is
      to assess if there are specific, patient behavior characteristics which are associated with
      the success of a novel asthma medication reminder system.

The intervention group will have SMS reminder and audiovisual reminder functions turned on.

SmartInhaler with reminder function turned on that is attached to Inhaler medication will reminding child's caregiver twice daily to administer daily asthma medication.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. We will recruit 30 children ages 5 to 17 years with a diagnosis of persistent
             asthma who require a daily inhaled corticosteroid metered dose inhaler and whose
             guardian is the person responsible for administering their daily asthma medication.

             2. We wil recruit only patients who have received or receive care at San Francisco
             General Hospital's 6M Children's Health Center.

             3. We will recruit patients whose daily inhaled corticosteroid are metered dose
             inhalers (MDI) of either Flovent (fluticasone propionate) HFA (Hydrofluoroalkane) or
             Qvar (beclamethasone dipropionate) HFA.

             4. We will also recruit only patients whose guardian responsible for administering
             their daily asthma medication has Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and whose primary
             language is Spanish.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. We will exclude patients whose guardian responsible for administering their daily
             asthma medication does not have a Bluetooth enabled cell phone capable of receiving
             text messages.

             2. We will exclude patients whose guardian responsible for administering their daily
             asthma medication does not have an available reliable power outlet where they can
             recharge the battery of their SmartInhaler.

             3. We will exclude patients whose guardian responsible for administering their daily
             asthma edication is unable to demonstrate correct medication technique based on
             standard evaluation (Press, 2011) after completion of a standard teaching protocol.

             5. We will exclude patients with chronic lung disease. 6. We will exclude patients
             who do not have an operating system of iOS or Android on their cell phone and who
             have no data plan with their cellular phone plan.

             7. We will exclude patients whose asthma medication regimen is being managed by an
             asthma subspecialist or health provider outside of the 6M Children's Health Center at
             San Francisco General Hospital.

             8. We will exclude patients who are using an inhaled long acting beta-agonist (LABA)
