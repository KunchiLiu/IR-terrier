  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether lymphedema rates are decreased
      in patients requiring regional nodal irradiation (RNI) who receive hypofractionated
      radiation as compared to conventional radiation.

      Participants with stage II or stage III node-positive breast cancer will be randomly
      assigned to either conventional radiation for 6 weeks or hypofractionated radiation for 4
      weeks. We hypothesize that patients receiving a shorter course of radiation will have
      reduced lymphedema. Lymphedema is diagnosed when the patient's arm circumference measures
      10% or more as compared to pre-treatment (baseline) arm circumference measurement. Secondary
      endpoints will address the effectiveness, quality of life, and side effect profile of a
      shortened course of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status 50% - 100%

          -  Diagnosis of stage II or III node-positive breast cancer (NOTE: Stages include:
             T4a-cNany, T3N1, TxN2.)

          -  For patients with TxN1 disease, one of the following criteria must be met: Grade 3; ≤
             45 years of age at time of screening for this study; extensive Lymphovascular Space
             Invasion (LVSI); 3 lymph nodes positive; hormone-negative disease; positive lymph
             nodes after chemotherapy; or extracapsular extension

          -  Prior surgery and chemotherapy allowed, no prior radiation to the target area (breast
             or chest and nodes). NOTE: Radiation should occur 3-12 weeks after last chemotherapy
             or surgery, whichever comes last.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCP) must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer

          -  Previously diagnosed malignancy excluding basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin (unless disease-free for 5 years or more)

          -  Diagnosis of scleroderma

          -  Diagnosis of lupus

          -  Diagnosis of active dermatomyositis

          -  Diagnosis of metastatic disease
