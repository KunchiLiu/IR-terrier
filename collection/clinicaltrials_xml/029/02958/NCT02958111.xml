  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an randomized, controlled, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-agent capecitabine as adjuvant
      chemotherapy in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, NPC patients (stage III-IV A, except T3-4 N0 and T3 N1) who finished the
      curative radiotherapy will be randomized to the observation group and capecitabine group
      (650 mg/m2 bid, p.o.，d1-21，q3wks; continued until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or over 1 year). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS).
      Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS),
      locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), toxic effects, and quality of life (QOL). All
      efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the safety
      population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.

          3. Tumor staged as American Joint Committee on Cance (AJCC) III-IV A (except T3-4 N0, T3
             N1), with newly histologically confirmed non-keratinizing NPC

          4. Within 12 ± 2 weeks after completion of the recommended curative radiotherapy
             treatment

          5. No clinical evidence of persistent loco-regional disease or distant metastases after
             radiotherapy

          6. Complete the recommended concurrent chemotherapy ± induction chemotherapy

          7. Adequate hematologic (neutrophil count &gt; 1.5×10^9/L, hemoglobin &gt; 90g/L and platelet
             count &gt; 100×10^9/L), hepatic (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase ≤
