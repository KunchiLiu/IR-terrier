    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer patients have a number of excellent treatment options to consider, and
      quality of life following treatment is often a consideration in treatment choice. One
      critical quality of life concern for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer is sexual
      function. Previous studies point to a vascular mechanism of impotence post-radiation
      therapy, as opposed to a nerve-based mechanism following surgery. In this study, the
      critical vascular structures (internal pudendal artery and corpus cavernosum) are defined by
      MRI-based imaging and included in treatment planning for radiation treatments, hopefully
      preserving critical artery function. This study will collect erectile function preservation
      rates at 5-years post-vessel-sparing radiotherapy with or without aids using the patient
      reported using the simplified three-question erectile function scale.

      The vast majority of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in the modern era of PSA
      screening have localized and potentially curable disease. Patients have a number of
      excellent treatment options to consider, and quality of life following treatment is often a
      consideration in treatment choice. One critical quality of life concern for patients
      diagnosed with prostate cancer is sexual function. Studies of sexual function post-radiation
      therapy fall into three categories: incidence studies; correlative (dose and toxicity)
      studies; mechanism(functional) studies. All these studies point to a vascular mechanism of
      impotence post-radiation therapy, as opposed to a nerve-based mechanism following surgery.
      In this study, the critical vascular structures (internal pudendal artery and corpus
      cavernosum) are defined by MRI-based imaging and included in treatment planning for
      radiation treatments. Investigators propose that this technique will improve quality of
      life, sexual function, and relapse-free survival.

      This study's primary aim is to determine erectile function preservation rates at 5-years
      post-vessel-sparing radiotherapy with or without aids using the patient reported using the
      simplified three-question erectile function scale.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer

          -  Patients must have measurable erectile function. Patients with erectile function on
             Viagra and drugs of the same class are eligible. Patients who require 6 months of
             hormonal therapy or less are eligible, provided baseline erectile function is
             measured prior to or within 14 days of the start of hormonal therapy.

          -  Baseline PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen), TNM stage (a classification of malignant
             tumors in cancer), and Gleason Score (A system of grading prostate cancer tissue
             based on how it looks under a microscope): Patients with low (PSA less than 10, T2a
             or less, Gleason 6 or less), intermediate, or high (Gleason 8-10, T3a, PSA over 20)
             risk disease are eligible for this protocol. Patients on finasteride or drugs of the
             same class are eligible.

          -  Patients must be 18 years or older. No upper age restriction.

          -  Patients treated with external beam radiotherapy alone or external beam therapy plus
             implant therapy are eligible.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group system of grading
             patient status that attempts to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and
             activities of daily life) performance status &lt;2.

          -  The patient must sign study specific informed consent approved by the IRB of U of M
             indicating they are aware of the investigational nature of the treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are impotent or have an IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function)
             &lt;16.

          -  Patients who are medically ineligible for radiation therapy due to other medical
             conditions.

          -  Patients given hormonal therapy before baseline questionnaires filled out.

          -  Patients who receive implant only therapy.

          -  Patients unable to undergo MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).
