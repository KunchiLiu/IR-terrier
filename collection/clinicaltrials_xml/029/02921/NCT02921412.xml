  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if adapted contact lens wearers enfilcon A toric
      lenses can be confidently refit into fanfilcon A toric lenses and can be successful after
      one month of daily wear.

          -  Has a spectacle cylinder of at least 0.75D in each eye.

          -  Can achieve best corrected spectacle refraction distance visual acuity of 20/25 (0.10
             logMAR) or better in each eye.

          -  Can achieve a distance visual acuity of 20/30 (0.18 logMAR) or better in each eye

             lenses

          -  Is willing to comply with the wear schedule (at least 5 days per week, &gt; 8 hours/day
