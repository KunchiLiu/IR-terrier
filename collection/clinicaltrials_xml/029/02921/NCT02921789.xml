    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the bleselumab regimen (basiliximab
      induction, tacrolimus, steroids and bleselumab) compared with the Standard of Care (SOC)
      regimen (basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, steroids and mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]) in the
      prevention of the recurrence of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) as defined by
      nephrotic range proteinuria with protein-creatinine ratio (&gt; 3.0 g/g) or initiation of
      plasmapheresis and no other evident etiology through 3 months post-transplant.

      The study will consist of the following periods: Screening (Days -21 to -1), Transplant (Day
      0), Post-Transplant (Day 0/post-skin closure through 12 months post-transplant). All
      subjects will enter into a Screening Period (Days -21 to -1 prior to transplant), undergo a
      Transplant (Day 0 [zero]), and are then to be followed for up to 12 months in the
      Post-Transplant Period (Day 0 through 12 months post-transplant).
