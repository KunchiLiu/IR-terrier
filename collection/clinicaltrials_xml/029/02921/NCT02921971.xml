      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate, in comparison with placebo, the efficacy of SAR156597 administered
      subcutaneously for 24 weeks on skin fibrosis in patients with dcSSc.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of SAR156597 compared to placebo on physical/functional
           disability in patients with dcSSc.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of SAR156597 compared to placebo on respiratory function in
           patients with dcSSc.

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of SAR156597 compared to placebo in patients with dcSSc.

        -  To evaluate the potential for immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies [ADA] response) of
           SAR156597 in patients with dcSSc.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) (trough plasma concentrations) of SAR156597
           administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks.
