  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 2, open-label, randomized, cross-over, pharmacokinetic study designed to determine
      the effect of meals of various amounts of fat given immediately prior to dosing on the
      pharmacokinetics of oral testosterone undecanoate. Approximately 20 hypogonadal subjects
      will be dosed for a 14 day run-in period. This will be followed by a randomized sequence of
      five periods over a 6 day confinement period. Subjects will receive a randomly ordered
      sequence of breakfast meals containing various amounts of fat, fasting, 15 g, 30 g, 45 g and
      a high fat breakfast consistent Guidance for Industry on Food-Effect Bioavailability and Fed
      Bioequivalence Studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, randomized, cross over, pharmacokinetic study. Subjects will
      initially be dosed for 2 weeks (Run-In Phase) to allow suppression of endogenous
      testosterone production, while allowing the oral TU to reach steady state. The subjects will
      then be confined to a clinical unit in which they undergo the PK Phase of the study. During
      the PK Phase of the study, subjects will undergo a five-period cross-over in which oral TU
      is dosed twice daily. Subjects will dose in the morning and in the evening immediately prior
      to protocol-defined meals. The protocol-defined breakfasts will contain various levels of
      fat including 15 g, 30 g, 45 g, a breakfast consistent with the fat and calorie content of
      the high-fat breakfast consistent with recommendations in the Guidance for Industry on
      Food-Effect Bioavailability and Fed Bioequivalence Studies (December 2002), or while fasting
      (with no meal until 4 hours post-dose). Subjects will be randomized to a designated sequence
      of the protocol-defined breakfasts, or the fasted state. The subjects will be required to
      consume the entire breakfast within 20 minutes during the PK Phase. The protocol-defined
      evening meal will be required to be consumed within 20 minutes. The 5 meal periods will
      occur on sequential days.

      Approximately twenty (20) subjects will be enrolled in order to ensure completion of 16
      subjects.
