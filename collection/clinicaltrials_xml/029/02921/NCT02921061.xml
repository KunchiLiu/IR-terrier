  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of decitabine when
      given together with filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride in
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that is newly
      diagnosed, has come back, or has not responded to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as decitabine, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Colony-stimulating factors, such as
      filgrastim, may increase the production of blood cells and may help the immune system
      recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Decitabine, filgrastim, cladribine,
      cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of decitabine when used sequentially or
      concomitantly with filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride
      (G-CLAM) independently in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate, within the limits of a phase I study, disease response and duration of
      remission.

      II. Describe, within the limits of a phase I study, the toxicity profile of the study
      regimen.

      III. Describe, within the limits of a phase I study, the impact of the study regimen on
      quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of decitabine. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      groups.

      GROUP I (PRIMED): Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -14 to
      -5. Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5, cladribine IV over 2
      hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 2-4 hours on days 1-5 and mitoxantrone hydrochloride
      IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3.

      GROUP II (CONCURRENT): Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-10. Patients
      also receive filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride as in Group
      I.

      In both groups, treatment repeats every 10 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning 6 weeks after achieving complete remission (CR)/CR with
      incomplete count recovery (CRi), patients receive decitabine, filgrastim, cladribine and
      cytarabine as in Arm I. Treatment repeats every 10 days for up to 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at for 1 month and every 3
      months for up to 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For patients with newly diagnosed disease: diagnosis of &quot;high-grade&quot; MDS (&gt;= 10%
             blasts by morphology) or AML other than acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with
             t(15;17)(q22;q12) or variants according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO)
             classification; for patients with relapsed/refractory disease: prior diagnosis of
             &quot;high-risk&quot; MDS or non-APL AML, with relapsed/refractory disease according to 2003
             recommendations of the International Working Group, requiring first or subsequent
             salvage therapy; patients with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) are eligible

          -  Outside diagnostic material is acceptable as long as peripheral blood and/or bone
             marrow slides are reviewed at the study institution; flow cytometric analysis of
             peripheral blood and/or bone marrow should be performed according to institutional
             practice guidelines

          -  Patients with prior autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
             are eligible if relapse occurs provided symptoms of graft-versus host disease are
             well controlled with stable use of immunosuppressive agents

          -  Treatment-related mortality (TRM) score =&lt; 9.2 as calculated with simplified model

          -  Should be off any active therapy for AML with the exception of hydroxyurea for at
             least 14 days prior to study registration unless patient has rapidly progressive
             disease, and all grade 2-4 non-hematologic toxicities should have resolved

          -  May have previously received monotherapy with demethylating agents for MDS or AML or
             treatment with a mitoxantrone- or cladribine-based regimen for MDS or AML, including
             G-CLAM, but not demethylating agent as priming for or in combination with
             chemotherapy

          -  Patients with symptoms/signs of hyperleukocytosis or white blood cells (WBC) &gt;
             100,000/uL can be treated with leukapheresis or may receive up to 2 doses of
             cytarabine (up to 500 mg/m^2/dose) prior to enrollment

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) unless elevation is
             thought to be due to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilbert's syndrome, or hemolysis
             (assessed within 14 days prior to registration)

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL (assessed within 14 days prior to registration)

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;= 45%, assessed within 3 months prior to
             registration, e.g. by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan or echocardiography, or
             other appropriate diagnostic modality and no clinical evidence of congestive heart
             failure; if the patient had anthracycline-based therapy since the most recent cardiac
             assessment, cardiac evaluation should be repeated if there is clinical or
             radiographic suspicion of cardiac dysfunction, or if the previous cardiac assessment
             was abnormal

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refractory/relapsing myeloid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), unless
             patient is not considered candidate for tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment

          -  Concomitant illness associated with a likely survival of &lt; 1 year

          -  Active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection, unless disease is under
             treatment with anti-microbials and/or controlled or stable (e.g. if specific,
             effective therapy is not available/feasible or desired [e.g. chronic viral hepatitis,
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)]); patient needs to be clinically stable as
             defined as being afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 24-48 hours

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any study drug

          -  Pregnancy or lactation
