      This study was a pilot 3-month clinical trial that investigated the feasibility,
      effectiveness, and acceptability of using the Track Health function of the Veterans Health
      Administration's patient health record for effecting a more positive physical activity (PA)
      and dietary intake lifestyle in a sample of 38 overweight and obese Veterans with
      prediabetes. Baseline and three-month post-intervention outcomes were measured in two main
      domains: objective (e.g., weight) and subjective (e.g., self-efficacy).

      This was a pilot clinical trial that used a single-group design to test the feasibility,
      effectiveness, and acceptability of using the Track Health (TH) function of My HealtheVet,
      the VA's patient health record (PHR), as a tool for effecting a more positive physical
      activity (PA) and dietary intake lifestyle in overweight and obese Veterans with
      prediabetes. Baseline and three-month post-intervention outcomes were measured in two main
      domains: objective (PA as measured by an accelerometer, diet, weight, abdominal
      circumference, BMI, and blood pressure) and subjective (self-efficacy, intent to adhere to
      lifestyle change, and patient activation). Assessments, including screening on inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, physiological measurements, administration of questionnaires, and
      training on use of two critical features of the TH function--the use of Journals to enter
      dietary and PA data and the use of Vitals + Readings to enter weight and track physiological
      measures--took place place across four visits to the study site, which was the Veterans
      Administration Medical Center in Miami. The investigators hypothesized that this PHR-based
      intervention would demonstrate improvements and increases, respectively in the objective and
      subjective domain measures. The investigators also hypothesized that engagement by study
      participants with MHV would be demonstrated through meeting target criteria regarding making
      entries into this PHR's TH function, and that participants would be satisfied with the
      intervention.

    <description>The study intervention involved the provision to study participants of targeted instruction and practice on use of two features of the Track Health (TH) function of the VA's patient health record (PHR) known as My HealthyVet (MHV) -- Journals and Vitals + Readings -- as a basis for promoting positive physical activity (PA) and dietary lifestyles. Seven interactive multimedia instructional modules were developed by the study team. These modules demonstrated on a computer screen how to enter PA and diet information into the Journals feature; how to add weight data into the Vitals + Readings feature; how to view these and other measures in tabular and graphical formats over different time frames; and the concept of possible cause-effect links between behavioral lifestyle and physiological outcome data. Participants were directed to enter food intake, PA, and weight information a specified number of times per week over the 3-month study period.</description>
