  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, sequentially enrolling single arm phase II trial to
      evaluate the activity of TAS-102 in previously treated metastatic and locally advanced
      unresectable pancreatic cancer after progression through or intolerance to first line
      chemotherapy. Trial therapy will consist of TAS-102 (Lonsurf®) 35 mg/m2 to be given orally
      twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 with cycles repeating every 28 days. The primary endpoint
      is to determine the progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with unresectable pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic or cytologic confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

          -  Clinically metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease as verified by
             radiographic imaging.

          -  Documented progression or intolerance to first line chemotherapy.

          -  TAS102 will be planned to start after disease progression on first-line chemotherapy,
             provided any prior chemotherapy-related toxicities have resolved to less than or
             equal to Grade 1 or baseline. Grade 2 or greater toxicities including alopecia, skin
             pigmentation,and platinum induced neurotoxicity/neuropathy are acceptable for
             starting on trial, as these toxicities do not preclude treatment with TAS102

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-2

          -  Capacity to understand and sign the informed consent document

          -  Able to take medications orally

             line of chemotherapy. Previous surgery and/or radiotherapy could have been performed
             up to one month prior to study enrollment, but there must be evidence of disease
             progression radiographically or intolerance to first-line chemotherapy. Patients on

             anticoagulation dose for at least 2 weeks prior to trial enrollment

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of

             enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of
             avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an
             unintentional pregnancy.
