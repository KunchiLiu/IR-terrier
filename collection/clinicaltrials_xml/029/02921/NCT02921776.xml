      This Phase II Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) will deliver a
      comprehensive patient communication solution for communication-impaired patients in the
      intensive care unit that may help decrease days in delirium, decrease anxiety levels, and
      reduce sedation exposure which are proximal outcomes known to be associated with decreased
      mechanical ventilation days, shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay, and lower healthcare
      cost. The primary goal of this Phase II STTR proposal is to further define user requirements
      and product specifications and develop a prototype of VidaTalk, a patient-centric, touch pad
      communication software, to provide mechanically ventilated (MV) patients an evidence-based
      solution for effectively communicating their needs to care providers and family. A secondary
      goal is to test the impact of the VidaTalk on clinical outcomes. This study will use mixed
      methods including observations and interaction with hospitalized patients as they use the
      VidaTalk tool, surveys and medical record data extraction, product evaluation and brief
      interview, satisfaction surveys with family members of ICU patients, and focus groups with
      Registered Nurses.

      Specific Aim 1. Develop a commercial prototype of VidaTalk that will include multilingual
      and customizable messages, compatibility with tablet devices, picture symbols, and
      integration with mobile communication devices.

      Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate usability with iterative user assessment testing in a clinical
      setting.

      Specific Aim 3. Test the clinical efficacy of VidaTalk via android application with MV
      patients by examining qualitative and quantitative endpoints in a clinical setting. Aim 3
      hypothesis: MV patients using VidaTalk will demonstrate significant reductions in
      patient-reported communication difficulty and frustration, anxiety, sedation exposure,
      delirium/coma-free days, and improved patient and family satisfaction with ICU care compared
      to MV patients receiving attention-control (i.e., tablets with health education
      application).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment-induced communication impairment is one of the most common and distressful
      symptoms to mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients and is associated
      with anxiety, panic, anger, frustration, sleeplessness, and distress.This Phase II Small
      Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) will deliver a comprehensive solution that may
      help decrease days in delirium, decrease anxiety levels, and reduce sedation exposure which
      are proximal outcomes known to be associated with decreased mechanical ventilation days,
      shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay, and lower healthcare cost. The primary goal of
      this Phase II STTR proposal is to further define user requirements and product
      specifications and develop a prototype of VidaTalk (previously TouchTalk), a
      patient-centric, touch pad communication software, to provide mechanically ventilated (MV)
      patients an evidence-based solution for effectively communicating their needs to care
      providers and family. A secondary goal is to test the impact of the VidaTalk on clinical
      outcomes (e.g., patient-reported communication difficulty and frustration, anxiety, sedation
      exposure, delirium/coma-free days, and improved patient and family satisfaction with ICU
      care). This study will use mixed methods including observations and interaction with
      hospitalized patients as they use the VidaTalk communication tool, surveys and medical
      record data extraction, product evaluation and brief interview, satisfaction survey with
      family members of ICU patients and focus groups with Registered Nurses. Our Phase I STTR
      successfully delivered a beta prototype that met technical feasibility criteria; however,
      additional requirements emerged as a common theme from user testing and market analysis. The
      current study will meet the identified needs for VidaTalk to operate on android devices, be
      customizable to patients' unique message needs, use pictures symbols for communication, and
      be able to route patient requests to providers who are not present at the bedside.

      Specific Aim 1. Develop a commercial prototype of VidaTalk that will include multilingual
      and customizable messages, compatibility with tablet devices, picture symbols, and
      integration with mobile communication devices.

      Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate usability with iterative user assessment testing in a clinical
      setting.

      Specific Aim 3. Test the clinical efficacy of VidaTalk via android application with MV
      patients by examining qualitative and quantitative endpoints in a clinical setting. Aim 3
      hypothesis: MV patients using VidaTalk will demonstrate notable reductions in
      patient-reported frustration and communication difficulty, anxiety, sedation exposure,
      delirium/coma-free days, and improved patient and family satisfaction with ICU care compared
      to MV patients receiving attention-control.

    <description>Aim 1 is a two group iterative design. Group 1 and Group 2 will each consist of five previously mechanically ventilated patients who will be recruited from the ICUs at the OSUWMC, including discharged patients.
Intervention will be Aim 1 - VidaTalk - tasks. Group 1 will use an initial android prototype of VidaTalk tablet application to be assessed for functionality (ergonomics, ease of use, ease of learning, simplicity, effectiveness and user interface) and usability on customizable communication, picture symbols, and integration with mobile communication devices.
Group 2 will use an improved alpha prototype of VidaTalk tablet application version engineered from observations made during Group 1 sessions.</description>

    <description>Observation of task completion will be made while patients complete a series of messages using the VidaTalk app:
Tell me you are tired
Tell me you are having pain
Rate this pain
Tell me there is pain in your back
Tell me your pain is sharp
Ask to see the doctor
Write your favorite color by drawing with your finger
Type &quot;How are you?&quot; Patients will also complete a 1-item difficulty rating and a 3-item After-Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ) after each task.
Patients will also be asked to (a) comment on the customization of the app and make suggestions; (b) rate the extent to which they would use the device if they were an ICU patient and unable to speak.
Group 1 only:
Patients will be asked about their preferences for customizing the VidaTalk app.</description>
