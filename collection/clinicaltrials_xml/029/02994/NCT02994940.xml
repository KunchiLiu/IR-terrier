  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen is frequently used as an adjunct for pain management in pediatric surgical
      patients. The drug is available in an over the counter, inexpensive oral form as well as a
      considerably more expensive intravenous form. This study will compare opioid requirements
      and acetaminophen plasma levels post operatively for two dosing regimens to compare oral
      versus intravenous routes given pre operatively.

      The primary purpose of this study is to compare opioid utilization in post-operative
      patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, between IV and PO acetaminophen.
      Secondarily, it will provide information regarding possible cost savings, pharmacokinetics
      and safety between these two regimens.
