  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial standard treatment of breast cancer is surgery. Tumor involvement of lymph nodes
      is of paramount importance in the subsequent management of this cancer and surgery of
      invasive breast cancer involves axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). To preserve arm
      lymphatic drainage during ALND and avoid the risk of arm lymphedema, mapping the lymphatic
      drainage by axillary reverse mapping (ARM) has been developed. But oncological safety is
      uncertain.

      The ARM procedure presented here uses indocyanine green (ICG) and fluorescence detection of
      draining lymphatics. The project aims to train surgeons to the technique and to identify
      predictive factors for metastatic ARM nodes in invasive BC using tumor and axillary
      pathological parameters to better select patients who would not require removal of the ARM
      node in the future
