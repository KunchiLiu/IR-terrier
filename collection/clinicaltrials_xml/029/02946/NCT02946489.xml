  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use disorders remain a significant public health problem. The pharmacological
      facilitation of behavioral treatment represents a promising strategy for addressing
      disordered cannabis use. Cannabis use disorders are recognized to be associated with various
      vulnerabilities that complicate the course of treatment and that may be amenable to
      glutamate modulators. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial is to
      test various glutamate modulators in conjunction with motivational enhancement therapy (MET)
      and mindfulness based relapse prevention (MBRP) for cannabis use disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals diagnosed with cannabis dependence will be randomized to receive one or two
      infusions of glutamate modulators during week 2 and week 3 or 4. The participants will also
      receive 2-week course of MET and 4-week course of MBRP. Participants will meet with staff
      twice weekly, except for week 2 and potentially week 3 or 4 during which participants will
      present to the clinic three times. Clinic visits include MET sessions, MBRP sessions,
      psychiatric monitoring, assessments, and study procedures (e.g., medication administration).
