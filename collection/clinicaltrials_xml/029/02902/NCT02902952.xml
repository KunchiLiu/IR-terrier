  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is one of the most frequent comorbidities in children with ASD leading to poor
      clinical outcomes. Physical exercise has been shown to be a promising and easy to implement
      intervention for reducing anxiety. However, little is known about the feasibility and
      efficacy of physical exercise to reduce anxiety in children with ASD from underserved,
      low-income families. Children with ASD, ages 6 - 12 years old from low-income and Latino
      families will be recruited for the study and assigned to an exercise intervention group and
      a sedentary control group. The physical exercise program is an eight-week program,
      administered three times per week in small groups. Compliance, parent-rated anxiety, and
      salivary cortisol will be measured before and after completion of the exercise and control
      group interventions.
