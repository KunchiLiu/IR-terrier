      Paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a manifestation of severe,
      life-threatening lung injury. Care for paediatric patient is mainly supportive and based on
      what works in adults and personal experiences, including the use of mechanical ventilation.
      However, differences in lung physiology and immunology between (young) children and adults
      suggests that adaptation of adult practices into paediatrics may not be justified. A study
      in adults with severe ARDS showed that early use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA)
      improved 90-day survival and increased time off the ventilator without increasing muscle
      weakness. It is unknown if this is also true for paediatric ARDS
