  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, open-label trial randomizes adult patients intubated in the ED with a
      Macintosh blade to use or not use a bougie for the first intubation attempt. The primary
      outcome is first pass success.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary analysis for all outcomes will be for those with a difficult airway
      characteristic (defined as any of: cervical immobility, obesity, large tongue, short neck,
      small mandible, facial or neck trauma, airway edema, blood in the airway, or vomit in the
      airway).

      We will also analyze all outcomes for all patients enrolled, regardless of whether they have
      a difficult airway characteristic.

      We plan to enroll 374 patients with a difficult airway characteristic (DAC). The total
      enrollment for the trial will be higher, depending on the proportion of patients that have a
      DAC.

      Based on observational data, we aim to detect a 9% absolute difference in first pass success
      (95% with bougie compared to 86% without the bougie), which requires enrollment of 374
      patients with a DAC.

      To help achieve balanced randomization for patients with a DAC, patients are stratified into
      two groups: 1) obese or cervical immobilization present and 2) not obese and no cervical
      immobilization.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>First pass success</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>First pass success is defined as placement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) into the trachea on the first attempt. An attempt begins when the laryngoscope enters the mouth, and ends if either of the following occur:
the laryngoscope leaves the mouth, regardless of whether an attempt was made to pass the endotracheal tube or bougie.
if the operator cannot intubate the trachea with the first tube device (ETT or bougie), and switches to any other tube device, even if the laryngoscope blade remains in the mouth.
A patient will be considered to achieve the primary outcome if they are intubated successfully on the first attempt.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>First pass success without hypoxemia</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>First pass success without hypoxemia. Hypoxemia is defined as a pulse oximetry value (SpO2) less than 90% at any point during intubation, or a drop of more than 10% from baseline if starting below 90%. The outcome of hypoxemia will be recorded beginning when the first attempt begins and ending one minute after inflation of the ETT cuff.
A patient will be considered to achieve this outcome if 1) they are intubated successfully on the first attempt, and 2) do not experience hypoxemia on the first attempt.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to intubation (first attempt)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Time to intubation will be defined as the time elapsed between the beginning of the intubation attempt to inflation of the ETT cuff when the tube is in the trachea.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Esophageal intubation</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>defined as passage of the ETT into the esophagus, with subsequent ventilation, and then removal. Clinically, esophageal intubation is identified by the absence of end-tidal carbon dioxide, abnormal physical exam, and hypoxia. This does not count passage of the ETT into the esophagus during the attempt if the ETT is removed during the attempt.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypoxemia</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoxemia is defined as a pulse oximetry value (SpO2) less than 90% at any point during intubation, or a drop of more than 10% from baseline if starting below 90%. The outcome of hypoxemia will be recorded beginning when the first attempt begins and ending one minute after inflation of the ETT cuff.</description>
