    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) improves walking performance
      in patients with PAD from its first use. Additionally, the study will test walking
      performance after a three month AFO intervention and will examine the feasibility of this
      AFO intervention.

      Data for evaluations will be collected from 50 patients with PAD. Fifty healthy age-matched
      controls will be participate in one baseline gait assessment for comparison purposes. Both
      groups between 40-85 years old.

      Interventions and Evaluations Biomechanics evaluations: Patients with PAD will complete a
      biomechanics evaluation at baseline, following three months of control (standard of care),
      and following three months of AFO intervention. The evaluation will include measurement of
      walking distances, gait function, physical activity, quality of life, energy cost, muscle
      morphometrics, muscle activity, muscle oxygenation, and muscle strength and endurance while
      walking with and without the AFO. Healthy controls will be assessed during one baseline
      collection only and their participation in the study will then be finished.

      Feasibility interview: All patients with PAD will participate in feasibility interviews that
      will assess acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality. Interviews will occur
      1.5 months and following completion of the AFO intervention (not the control arm).

      AFO and Control (standard of care) Intervention: Patients will wear an off-the-shelf, carbon
      composite AFO that is adjusted for them for three months. The patients will be asked to wear
      the AFO at all times except when they are in bed or showering/bathing. The instructions
      given to the patients about walking will be to follow the instructions from their doctor
      regarding risk factor management and exercise. The intervention order will be randomized and
      all subjects will participate in both arms.
