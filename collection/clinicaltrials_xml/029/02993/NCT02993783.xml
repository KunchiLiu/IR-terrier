  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the initial activity, tolerability, safety and to
      identify a recommended dose and regimen of vedolizumab intravenous (IV) administered for
      treatment of steroid-refractory acute intestinal GvHD in participants who have undergone
      allo-HSCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. This study will look at the
      tolerability and effectiveness of vedolizumab IV in participants with acute intestinal GvHD
      who have received no systemic therapy for the treatment of acute GvHD (prophylaxis
      acceptable) other than corticosteroids.

      The study will enroll approximately 38 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Vedolizumab IV 300 mg

        -  Vedolizumab IV 600 mg

      All participants will be infused intravenously at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in multiple countries. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 36 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>Complete Response (CR) is defined as the resolution of all signs and symptoms of acute graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). Very good partial response (VGPR) is defined as resolution of the signs and symptoms of the GvHD: 1) Skin: No rash, or residual erythematous rash involving &lt;25% of the body surface, without bullae (excluding residual faint erythema and hyperpigmentation).
2) Liver: Total serum bilirubin concentration &lt;2 mg/dL or &lt;25% of baseline at enrollment.
3) Gut: a) Participant tolerates food or enteral feeding; b) Predominantly formed stools; c) No overt gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal cramping; d) No more than occasional nausea or vomiting. Partial Response (PR) is defined as improvement of 1 GvHD stage in 1 or more organs without progression in any organ.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence, significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. Among these, events which are considered possibly associated with a medicinal product are defined as adverse drug reactions.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Response (CR) is defined as the resolution of all signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD). Very good partial response (VGPR) is defined as resolution of the majority of signs and symptoms of intestinal GvHD: a) Participant tolerates food or enteral feeding; b) Predominantly formed stools; c) No overt gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal cramping; d) No more than occasional nausea or vomiting. Partial Response (PR) is defined as improvement of intestinal GvHD by at least 1 stage.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experience Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 32 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Recipient of 1 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) but not
             more than 1 (allo-HSCT).

          2. Has primary steroid-refractory intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).
             Steroid-refractory disease is defined as worsening or no improvement in 5 to 7 days
             of treatment with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg or equivalent or lack of a complete
             response (CR) after 14 days of primary treatment with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg or
             equivalent. Note that participants who develop intestinal GvHD while receiving
             systemic therapy for other GvHD are still eligible after 5 to 7 days, even if the
             intestinal GvHD has not been present for the entire duration. Participants who may
             have received an increase in their steroid dose treatment (e.g., increased
             methylprednisolone from 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg) before enrollment will be eligible,
             provided the participant has met the definition of steroid refractory above.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 3.

          4. Evidence of myeloid engraftment defined by absolute neutrophil count ≥0.5*109/L on 3
             consecutive days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of chronic GvHD at Screening (including acute-chronic overlap syndrome).

          2. Relapse of underlying malignant disease after allo-HSCT.

          3. Hyperacute GvHD defined as onset of GvHD within the first 15 days following
             hematopoietic stem cell infusion.

          4. Received systemic agents other than corticosteroids for treatment of acute GvHD. GvHD
             prophylaxis agents (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) may be continued.

          5. Acute steroid-resistant GvHD beyond 28 days from primary treatment.

          6. Life expectancy of &lt;3 weeks.
