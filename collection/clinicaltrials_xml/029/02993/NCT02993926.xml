    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called leuprorelin. Leuprorelin is being researched
      to treat children who have CPP. This study will look at long term safety and efficacy of
      leuprorelin in the treatment of Chinese participants with CPP.

      The study will enroll approximately 300 patients. Participants will be assigned to following
      groups based on the dose received per body weight:

        -  Leuprorelin low dose group

        -  Leuprorelin high dose group

      All participants who have received leuprorelin 30 μg/kg to &lt;90 μg/kg or 90 μg/kg to 180
      μg/kg per body weight, injection, subcutaneously, every 4 weeks up to at least 9 months
      during the index period from September 1st 1998 to September 30th 2017 will be observed.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. Data will be collected over period of 19
      months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 19 years</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who had Regression or no Progression in Tanner Staging</measure>
    <time_frame>Last observation prior to entry into follow up phase in index period (up to 19 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Tanner assessment score is used to document the stage of development of secondary sexual characteristics. Female pubertal development staged by pubic hair development and breast size; male pubertal development staged by size of the genitalia and development of pubic hair. Rated in 5 stages: stage 1 (no development) to 5 (adult-like development in quantity and size). Regression or no progression is defined as negative change (improvement) or no change in Tanner score at last observation prior to entry into follow up phase in index period (up to 19 years) compared to baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Last observation prior to entry into follow up phase in index period (up to 19 years)</time_frame>
    <description>A lab test is conducted to measure LH and FSH levels. Levels are compared to individual pre-puberty levels.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Estradiol or Testosterone Level Suppression to Pre-pubertal Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Last observation prior to entry into follow up phase in index period (up to 19 years)</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Last observation prior to entry into follow up phase in index period (up to 19 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Bone age (BA) is estimated locally using an X-ray (bone scan). Chronological age (CA) at the date of corresponding X-ray (Date of X-ray - Date of birth)/365.25. Ratio of BA/CA is calculated at each annual study visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Increase From Baseline in Predicted Adult Height</measure>
    <time_frame>Last observation prior to entry into follow up phase in index period (up to 19 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Predicted adult height is calculated using the Bayley-Pinneau charts with skeletal age assessment (SAA). SAA was calculated using the Greulich and Pyle (GP) or Tanner and Whitehouse (TW) method. The height of the participants were measured at the site. Standard deviation score (SDS) report the number of standard deviations from the mean for age and sex for an individual measurement (normal range: -2 to +2 SDS). Height SDS is derived by subtracting the population mean from individual's height value and then dividing that difference by the population standard deviation to derive Bayley-Pinneau charts.</description>
