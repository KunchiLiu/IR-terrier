      The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and
      sustainability of utilizing statewide Immunization Information Systems (IIS) to conduct
      centralized reminder/recall (R/R) to improve Human Papiloma Virus (HPV) vaccination rates
      among adolescents ages 11-17.

      The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and
      sustainability of utilizing statewide Immunization Information Systems (IIS) to conduct
      centralized reminder/recall (R/R) to improve HPV vaccination rates among adolescents ages
      11-17. The investigators will extend previous research on effectiveness of centralized R/R
      to a new population--adolescents due for HPV vaccine-- and test the use of centralized R/R
      as a cancer-prevention strategy. Investigators will assess the effect of centralized R/R in
      two states--one with and one without mandated reporting of vaccinations to IISs, and
      disseminate IIS R/R to other states. Investigators will implement, evaluate (using the
      RE-AIM framework 31-36), and disseminate a collaborative, IIS-based centralized HPV vaccine
      R/R model in which partnerships of public health systems and primary care practices in two
      states (NY, CO) collaborate to remind parents about HPV vaccination.

      Specific Aims and hypotheses:

      Aim #1: Adapt IIS messages and delivery systems (e.g., algorithms) previously developed for
      centralized R/R for other vaccines to fit HPV vaccine IIS R/R.

      Aim #2: Assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of centralized IIS-based (IIS-C) autodialer
      (phone) R/R in increasing vaccine rates [initial dose (HPV#1) and a complete series (HPV#3)]
      among teens.

      Conduct a pragmatic trial, to assess the impact and cost effectiveness of centralized
      IIS-based (IIS-C) autodialer (phone) R/R in increasing initiation and completion rates for
      the HPV vaccine series in adolescents ages 11-17 years. The investigators will use a
      within-practice design, randomizing patients within randomly selected primary care practices
      to IIS-C R/R (1, 2, or 3 reminders per dose) compared to usual care (0 reminders from this
      study). The investigators will apply the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the reach,
      effectiveness/cost effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of IIS-C R/R.

      Hypothesis 2a: IIS-C R/R will result in higher HPV vaccination rates than usual care.

      Hypothesis 2b: IIS-C R/R will result in higher HPV vaccination rates than usual care in key
      subgroups (males and females, younger and older teens, urban//rural teens).

      Hypothesis 2c: IIS-C R/R will be more cost-effective (cost/vaccine received) than usual
      care.

      Aim #3: Disseminate IIS-C R/R across NY and CO and pilot in four IISs: (a) Develop an IIS-C
      HPV R/R toolkit, (b) Use a technical advisory group, (c) Initiate IIS-C R/R in four other
      IISs [Yr. 4].

      By the end of the study investigators will have a feasible, sustainable, cost-effective
      model for HPV vaccine reminders that can be used nationally to prevent cervical cancer and
      other HPV-related cancers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Initiation of the HPV vaccine series (receipt and documentation of initial dose of vaccine series within immunization registry)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Did the adolescent initiate the HPV vaccine series? The investigators are allowing up to 5 months after the initial recall notice for the adolescent to make an appointment and receive their dose. After that time frame, the investigators will not attribute vaccination to the recall. Receipt will be documented by providers within the state immunization registry via EMR direct transfer or manual entry.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Completion of the HPV vaccine series (receipt and documentation of final dose of vaccine series within immunization registry)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Did those eligible to complete the HPV vaccine series within the time frame of the study do so? The investigators are allowing up to 5 months after the initial recall notice for the adolescent to make an appointment and receive their dose. After that time frame, the investigators will not attribute vaccination to the recall. Receipt will be documented by providers within the state immunization registry via EMR direct transfer or manual entry.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences between arms - initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Is 1, 2, or 3 reminders per arm most effective and cost effective for initiation. Only those who need an initial dose at baseline will be eligible for this outcome. Adolescents in each arm will be allowed up to 5 months after the first recall notice to get a vaccine. Receipt will be documented by providers within the state immunization registry via EMR direct transfer or manual entry.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences between arms - completion</measure>
    <time_frame>20 months</time_frame>
    <description>Is 1, 2, or 3 reminders per arm most effective and cost effective for completion. Because the second or third dose of the series is dependent on when the adolescent receives their initial dose, the investigators will be following eligible adolescents for 20 months to allow time for those who did not respond to the recall for the initial dose right away to be able to complete the series within the time frame. However, receipt of the completion dose will only be attributed to the recall if it was received within 5 months of the 1st recall for the completion dose. Receipt will be documented by providers within the state immunization registry via EMR direct transfer or manual entry.</description>
