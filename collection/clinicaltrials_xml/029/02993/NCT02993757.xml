  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the CYD dengue vaccine
      when administered concomitantly or sequentially with Gardasil® (Human Papillomavirus
      Quadrivalent [Types 6, 11, 16, and 18] Vaccine, Recombinant).

      Primary objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of geometric mean
           titers[GMTs]) to Gardasil after concomitant administration is non-inferior to
           sequential administration with the CYD dengue vaccine measured 28 days after the last
           dose of Gardasil.

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine after
           concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential administration with Gardasil
           measured 28 days after the last dose of the CYD dengue vaccine.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that the humoral immune response (in terms of seroconversion) to
           Gardasil after concomitant administration is non-inferior to sequential administration
           with the CYD dengue vaccine measured 28 days after the last dose of Gardasil

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to Gardasil at baseline and after each dose of
           Gardasil in each and any group

        -  To describe the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine at baseline and after
           each dose of the CYD dengue vaccine in each and any group

        -  To describe the safety of Gardasil and the CYD dengue vaccine after each and any dose
           in each group.

      All study participants will receive 3 doses of the CYD dengue vaccine and 2 doses of
      Gardasil administered either concomitantly or sequentially, They will be assessed for CYD
      immunogenicity and human papilloma virus (HPV) immunogenicity and safety up to 6 months
      after the last injection.
