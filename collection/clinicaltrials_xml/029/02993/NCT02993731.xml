    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written, signed consent for trial participation must be obtained from the patient
             appropriately in accordance with applicable International Conference on Harmonization
             (ICH) guidelines and local and regulatory requirements prior to the performance of
             any study specific procedure.

          2. Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced pancreatic ductal
             adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that is metastatic. The definitive diagnosis of metastatic PDAC
             will be made by integrating the histopathological data within the context of the
             clinical and radiographic data. Patients with islet cell neoplasms are excluded.

          3. Initial diagnosis of metastatic disease must have been demonstrated &lt; 6 weeks prior
             to randomization on the study.

          4. Must not have previously received chemotherapy or any investigational agent for the
             treatment of metastatic PDAC. A fluoropyrimidine or gemcitabine administered as a
             radiation sensitizer in the adjuvant setting is allowed for as long as last dose was
             administered &gt; 6 months prior to randomization and no lingering toxicities are
             present.

          5. Nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine therapy is appropriate for the patient and
             recommended by the Investigator.

          6. Patient has one or more metastatic tumors evaluable by CT scan with contrast (or MRI,
             if patient is allergic to CT contrast media). Imaging investigations including CT/MRI
             of chest/abdomen/pelvis or other scans as necessary to document all sites of disease
             must be performed within 14 days prior to randomization. Qualifying scans performed
             as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of the study informed consent
             will be acceptable as baseline scanning as long as scanning is performed &lt; 14 days
             prior to randomization.

          7. Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1,
             assessed within 14 days prior to randomization. Two observers will be required to
             assess the performance status (assessments will be done by a Principal Investigator
             and a sub-Investigator). If discrepant, the one with the most deteriorated
             performance status will be considered true.

          8. Must have life-expectancy of &gt; 12 weeks.

          9. Must be ≥ 18 years of age. Due to increased risk of sepsis in patients &gt;80 years old,
             candidate patients in this age group should be thoroughly evaluated prior to study
             randomization to ensure they are fit to receive chemotherapy. In addition to all of
             the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed, clinical judgment should be used regarding
             patients' susceptibility to infection (including but not limited to presence of
             ascites or diabetes mellitus increasing risk of infection). Furthermore, the expected
             stability of their performance status while receiving repeat weekly chemotherapy
             cycles should be given special attention. Patients in this age group should not be
             randomized on the study should there be any hesitation on any of these
             considerations.

         10. For male or female patients of child producing potential: Must agree to use
             contraception or take measures to avoid pregnancy during the study and for 180 days
             after the final dose of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine or for 30 days for female
             patients and for 90 days for male patients, after the final napabucasin dose if
             nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine were not administered.

         11. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 5 days prior to randomization.

         12. Patient has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood
             counts at baseline (obtained &lt; 14 days prior to randomization; laboratory testing
             performed as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of informed consent
             for the study will be acceptable as baseline laboratory work as long as testing is
             performed &lt; 14 days prior to randomization):

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L

               3. Hemoglobin (HgB) &gt; 9 g/dL

         13. Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at baseline (obtained &lt; 14 days
             prior to randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of care
             prior to patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable as
             baseline laboratory work as long as testing is performed &lt; 14 days prior to
             randomization):

               1. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) [≤ 5
                  × ULN in presence of liver metastases]

                  m^2 for patients with serum creatinine levels above or below the institutional
                  normal value. If using creatinine clearance, actual body weight should be used
                  for calculating creatinine clearance (eg. Using the Cockcroft-Gault formula).
                  For patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m^2, lean body weight should
                  be used instead.

         14. Patient has acceptable coagulation studies (obtained &lt; 14 days prior to
             randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of care prior to
             patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable as baseline
             laboratory work as long as testing is performed &lt; 14 days prior to randomization) as
             demonstrated by prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within
             normal limits (+15%).

         15. Patient has no clinically significant abnormalities on urinalysis results (obtained &lt;
             14 days prior to randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of
             care prior to patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable
             as baseline laboratory work as long as testing is performed &lt; 14 days prior to
             randomization).

         16. Patient must have adequate nutritional status with Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 18 kg/m^2
             and body weight of &gt; 40 kg with serum albumin &gt; 3 g/dL.

         17. Baseline laboratory evaluations must be done within 14 days prior to randomization
             and some must be repeated &lt; 72 hours prior to randomization.

         18. Patients requiring biliary stent placement must have biliary stent placed &gt; 7 days
             prior to screening.

         19. Pain symptoms should be stable and should not require modifications in analgesic
             management &lt; 7 days prior to randomization.

         20. Patient must consent to provision of, and Investigator(s) must confirm access to and
             agree to submit a representative formalin fixed paraffin block of tumor tissue in
             order that the specific correlative marker assays (Correlative Studies) of this
             protocol may be conducted. Submission of the tissue does not have to occur prior to
             randomization. Where local center regulations prohibit submission of blocks of tumor
             tissue, two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block and 5-20 unstained slides of whole
             sections of representative tumor tissue are preferred. Where it is not possible to
             obtain two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block, 5-20 unstained slides of
             representative tumor tissue are also acceptable. Where no previously resected or
             biopsied tumor tissue exists or is available, on the approval of the
             Sponsor/designated CRO, the patient may still be considered eligible for the study.

         21. Patient must consent to provision of a sample of blood in order that the specific
             correlative marker assays (Correlative Studies) may be conducted.

         22. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this
             trial must receive protocol treatment and be followed at the participating center.
             This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits placed on patients being
             considered for this trial. Investigators must ensure that the patients randomized on
             this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, response
             assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.

         23. Protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient randomization for
             patients randomized to Arm 1. Patients randomized to Arm 2 must begin protocol
             treatment within 4 calendar days of randomization.

         24. The patient is not receiving therapy in a concurrent clinical study and the patient
             agrees not to participate in other interventional clinical studies during their
             participation in this trial while on study treatment. Patients participating in
             surveys or observational studies are eligible to participate in this study.

             disease continuously for &gt; 5 years.

         19. Any active disease condition which would render the protocol treatment dangerous or
             impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy.

         20. Any condition (e.g. psychological, geographical, etc.) that does not permit
             compliance with the protocol, including patients with history of poor compliance or
