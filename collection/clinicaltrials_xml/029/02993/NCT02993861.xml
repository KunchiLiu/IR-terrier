    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label clinical trial. Study's purpose is to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics and safety of four oral anti-epileptics drugs
      (levetiracetam, valproic acid [divalproex sodium ER or immediate release formulation if
      inadequate enrollment}, topiramate, and ocarbazepine) in a non-randomized sample of obese
      children and adolescents. The study's duration will be up to eleven days (up to seven days
      of screening and four days of pharmacokinetic sampling). Eligible participants ages 2 to 18
      years will be identified through outpatient clinic schedules and inpatient admissions at
      each clinic site. Participants receiving at least one of the study drugs per local standard
      of care will have pharmacokinetic concentrations in plasma drawn according to the specific
      dosing schedule for each drug. Other study measures include demographics, BMI, waist/hip
      ratio, medical history, concomitant medication history, documentation of study drug oral
      intake, adverse effects, and physical examination. The sample size will include 24
      participants for each anti-epileptic drug (total 96).
