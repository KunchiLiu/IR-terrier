      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ropidoxuridine when given
      together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with cancer that has spread
      to the brain. Ropidoxuridine may help whole brain radiation therapy work better by making
      cancer cells more sensitive to the radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with brain metastases to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ropidoxuridine
      (5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose [IPdR]) when administered alone orally once daily for
      7 consecutive days and then concurrently with conventionally fractionated whole brain
      radiation therapy (WBRT) for 21 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity to IPdR-mediated radiosensitization.

      II. To estimate intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) in brain metastasis cancer
      patients who receive daily oral IPdR x 28 days and WBRT.

      III. To establish the pharmacokinetics of daily oral dosing of IPdR times 8 days.

      IV. To evaluate safety and tolerability of oral IPdR x 28 days and WBRT. V. To estimate the
      incidence of delayed neurological toxicity at 8, 16, 24 and 32 weeks (+/-1 week)
      post-completion of WBRT including delayed-recall through Hopkins Verbal Learning Test
      revised (HVLT-R).

      VI. To estimate the incidence of delayed neurological toxicity at 8, 16, 24 and 32 weeks
      (+/-1 week) post-completion of WBRT including delayed-recall through Hopkins Verbal Learning
      Test Revised (HVLT-R) and quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess, for patients treated at the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), for biochemical
      evidence of IPdR effect in normal tissues (circulating granulocytes) by measuring
      %IUdR-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cellular incorporation by flow cytometry and high-pressure
      liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses as an exploratory biomarker for the %IUdR-DNA tumor
      cell incorporation from day 8 extracranial tumor biopsies in brain metastasis cancer
      patients receiving MTD doses of IPdR as an exploratory biomarker of tumor radiosensitization
      using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      II. To assess, for patients treated at the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), for biochemical
      evidence of IPdR effect in normal tissues (circulating granulocytes) by measuring
      %IUdR-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cellular incorporation by flow cytometry and high-pressure
      liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses as an exploratory biomarker for the %IUdR-DNA cellular
      incorporation in patients' circulating granulocytes taken weekly during the 28-day IPdR MTD
      dose, on day 29, and week 8 as an exploratory biomarker of IPdR systemic toxicities to bone
      marrow as measured by serial complete blood count (CBC)/differential values.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ropidoxuridine.

      Patients receive ropidoxuridine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and undergo whole
      brain radiotherapy on days 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8, 16, and 24 weeks.
