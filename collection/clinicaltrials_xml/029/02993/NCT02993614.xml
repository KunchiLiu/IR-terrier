      This is a comparative effectiveness study comparing new users of SGLT-2 inhibitors with new
      users of other glucose lowering drugs with regard to hospitalization for heart failure and
      all cause mortality respectively. The study is carried out based on data from six countries:
      Unites States, United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Norway

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In September 2015 the EMPA-REG trial presented data on positive effects of empagliflozin, a
      SGLT-2 inhibitor on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. This has created a need for data on how
      this class of medicines affect CV event rates when used in clinical practice.

      The primary aim of this observational study is to compare the risk for hospitalization for
      heart failure, between patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are new users of a
      SGLT-2 inhibitor versus an active comparison group including patients with T2DM who are new
      users of other glucose lowering drugs. A secondary aim is to compare all-cause mortality
      using similar methods. Exploratory aims are to estimate the incidence of acute myocardial
      infarction and atrial fibrillation in both treatment groups.

      The study will be carried out based on data from six countries: United States (US), United
      Kingdom (UK), Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Norway. In the UK data from Clinical Practice
      Research Datalink (CPRD), The Health Improvement Network (THIN); will be used for the study,
      in the US Humedica, MarketScan; in Sweden the DAISY database; in Norway the DAPHNE database
      and in Denmark the DAFFODIL database; in Germany (&quot;Diabetes Patientenverlaufsdokumentation&quot;
      [DPV]) and Manitoba Centre for Health Care Policy (MCHP) in Canada.

      The Study Population will consist of new users of SGLT-2i and other glucose lowering drugs
      respectively. These will be compared with regard to hospitalization for heart failure and
      all-cause mortality (only possible in UK and the Nordic countries) during the follow-up
      period. In addition, acute myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation will be assessed
      descriptively in the two groups respectively.

      The study period will range from launch of the first SGLT-2i in each of the countries
      (November 2012 for Nordics, Germany and UK, March 2013 for US) and end at latest available
      data in each data source.

      The incidence of heart failure hospitalization and all cause mortality will be compared
      between new users of SGLT-2 inhibitors and the comparator arm using a hazard ratio (relative
      risk) and corresponding 95% confidence interval. The analysis will be performed using the
      Cox proportional hazards model or some other appropriate method.

      Matching by propensity scores will be used to balance the potential confounding covariates
      between the SGLT-2i group and the reference group to ensure that the two groups are as
      similar as possible at baseline.To achieve sufficient power, a meta-analysis based on the
      DerSimonian-Laird random effects model will be applied to integrate the point estimates from
      each of the individual database analyses and calculate an overall weighted estimate and
      corresponding 95% CI.
