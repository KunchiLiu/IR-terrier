    <textblock>
      Investigators will use a cluster-randomized design with three study arms to evaluate the
      impact of the Alive &amp; Thrive infant and young child feeding communication strategies in
      Lagos and Kaduna States, Nigeria. This is a mixed methods evaluation and the quantitative
      data will be complemented by qualitative data obtained from different groups targeted by or
      involved in the program.

    <textblock>
      Adequate nutrition during the first 1,000 days is necessary for children to grow and develop
      to their full potential. Alive &amp; Thrive (A&amp;T) contributes to better nutrition during the
      first 1,000 days by promoting improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. A&amp;T
      is expanding its efforts to Nigeria and will target Lagos and Kaduna States. In Nigeria, 33%
      of infants are breastfed within 1 hour of delivery, 60% are given other fluids in the first
      3 days of life, and only 17% of children 0-5.9 months are exclusively breastfed.
      Approximately 60% of children 6 to 23 months achieve the minimum meal frequency for their
      age and 19% are fed four or more food groups per day. To address these gaps in optimal IYCF
      practices, A&amp;T will implement different types of communication strategies, including
      interpersonal communication, community mobilization, and mass media communication. The two
      intervention models will include community mobilization and will differ in the interpersonal
      communication strategy. The two strategies are: (1) an intensive interpersonal communication
      intervention with a full array of messages on IYCF and multiple interactions with women in
      the target group and (2) a streamlined interpersonal communication approach with a more
      targeted set of messages and fewer interactions. These two interventions will be compared to
      mass media communication on infant and young child feeding, which will be provided
      throughout the two states. The primary objective of the proposed evaluation is to measure
      the impact of the two A&amp;T intervention models on IYCF practices among mothers with children
      0-23 months of age. Secondary evaluation objectives are to document: the type, quantity, and
      timing of the implementation of A&amp;T program activities by intervention model; coverage
      levels A&amp;T achieves with different program activities by intervention model; extent to which
      A&amp;T increases knowledge and awareness of optimal IYCF practices among women with children 0
      to 23 months and health providers by intervention model; extent to which A&amp;T improves the
      capacity of health providers to counsel mothers on IYCF by intervention model; extent to
      which A&amp;T improves the capacity of stakeholders to implement community-based activities that
      support optimal IYCF practices by intervention model.
