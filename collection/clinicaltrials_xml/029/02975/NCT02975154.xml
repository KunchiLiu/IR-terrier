    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of Microcurrent Therapy in the treatment of osteoarthritis
      of the knee. Patients will be randomized to four groups: Group 1 and 2 both will receive
      Microcurrent Therapy, but different currents will be used. Group 3 will receive treatment
      with the Microcurrent treatment apparatus, but without any current. Group 4 will be a
      control group without specific interventions.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized, controlled pilot study is to evaluate the effect of
      Microcurrent therapy on pain and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the
      knee. The secondary objective is to compare the effects of different currents. Patients will
      be randomized to four groups: Group 1 and 2 both will receive Microcurrent Therapy, but
      different currents will be used. Group 3 will receive treatment with the Microcurrent
      treatment apparatus, but without any current. Group 4 will be a control group without
      specific intervention.

      Group 1, 2 and 3 will receive 10 sessions of treatment in a treatment phase of four weeks.
      Assessments for group 1, 2, and 3 will be scheduled for screening (T0), at the first day of
      treatment (T1), at the end of treatment (T2) and three months after the end of treatment
      (T3). Group 4 will be assessed at a screening visit T0, at T1, at T2 (approximately 21 days
      after T1), and at T3 (three months after T2). Patients will be recruited based on the
      records of the clinic.

    <description>The microcurrent therapy will be applied with electrodes that are fixed around the knee. The two electrodes of channel A will be placed at the inner and outer side of the knee that is most affected by pain. The two electrodes of channel B will be placed above and below the patella. An apparatus with CE certificate will be used.</description>
