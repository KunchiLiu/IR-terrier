  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygen has previously been tested as a possible means for pre-conditioning to
      enhance exercise performance. This study is designed to examine the effects of exercising in
      a hyperbaric chamber for improving fitness when combined with high-intensity training.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy individuals, ages 18-40 years that are sedentary or recreationally active but
             not involved in any structured endurance training will be eligible for the study.
             This level of activity will be defined as performing mild-moderate aerobic exercise
             0-3 times per week.

          -  VO2 max within normal limits (defined as 84-120% predicted using Wasserman reference
             equations48).

          -  Spirometry within predicted limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects unable to complete a satisfactory VO2 max test

          -  Individuals with chronic cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, valve disease,
             coronary artery disease, cardiac conduction abnormalities, etc.

          -  History of pneumothorax or chronic lung disease such as asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis

          -  Active Smokers

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Persons unable to read or understand English, not in their full mental capacity or
             who are blind.
