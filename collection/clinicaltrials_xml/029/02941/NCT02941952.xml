  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In high-risk patients, it is now recommended to guide the intraoperative volume replacement
      via the stroke volume.

      Today, the most commonly used technique for estimating the stroke volume is the
      transpulmonary thermodilution and the arterial waveform analysis in the radial artery by
      PICCO®.

      This technique has the disadvantage of being invasive and increasing the time dedicated to
      anesthesia during the surgery.

      The future is the non-invasive monitoring of stroke volume. Thus, Edwards Life Science has
      developed a continuous monitoring technology and non-invasive arterial pressure, cardiac
      output and stroke volume using a digital sensor (ClearSight®). This continuous monitoring of
      blood pressure was validated in cardiothoracic surgery but studies about monitoring cardiac
      output or stroke volume are inconclusive and contradictory.

      The objective of this study is to compare the use of non-invasive monitoring of stroke
      volume by ClearSight® with the transpulmonary thermodilution and the arterial waveform
      analysis in radial artery by PICCO® in abdominal major surgery.
