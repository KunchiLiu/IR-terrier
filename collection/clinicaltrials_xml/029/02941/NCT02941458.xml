    <textblock>
      The GECP, in its commitment to improve the treatment and prognosis of patients with lung
      cancer and other thoracic tumors, has marked the individualization of treatment according to
      the expression of markers predictive of response to chemotherapeutic agents and molecular
      inhibitors of cell proliferation as one of its primary objectives. This could significantly
      improve the prognosis of patients with lung cancer, and will lead to a radical change in
      routine clinical practice. The aim of the register is to explore all data available of all
      patients treated because of thoracic tumours.

    <textblock>
      In Europe, patients with lung cancer have a poor prognosis, and there has been only limited
      improvement between 1999 and 2007. Potential advantages of the centralization of care and
      the discussion of treatment strategies in multidisciplinary teams, as suggested in other
      studies,13 require further research. However, the priorities should be to prevent lung
      cancer by implementing anti-smoking policies and controlling asbestos exposure throughout
      Europe, such as was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2008.14 Other
      priorities are to reduce levels of residential radon in risk areas, and early diagnosis to
      improve the results of surgery, which is still the main curative treatment.

      The variability in the diagnostic process, treatment and advocacy, as well as the
      anticipated increase in associated mortality in Spain in coming years, has stimulated the
      creation of an epidemiological, observational, multicenter study of cases of lung cancer and
      other thoracic tumors diagnosed and treated by medical personnel, including both thoracic
      surgeons and medical oncologists. Data from this study will be collected retrospectively and
      prospectively, so as to enable an extensive study of the epidemiological and therapeutic
      factors related to the disease.
