      This study assesses the number of CTCs before and 4-5 weeks after focal stereotactic
      radiotherapy, in single or fractionated dose, and correlate with the local and distant brain
      progression-free survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      Brain metastases (BM) are the most prevalent tumors of the central nervous system (CNS),
      with a ratio of 10: 1 relative to primary tumors. In breast cancer, BM are becoming more
      frequent due to longer life expectancy. Patients with HER2-positive metastatic disease are
      prone to develop BM more often and they occur in 20 - 40% of cases. Circulating tumor cells
      (CTC) originate from the primary tumor and can migrate to distant organs. The possible
      correlation between CTC and the incidence of brain metastases could help define radiotherapy
      in patients with oligometastatic or not so widespread disease in the brain. However, there
      are few studies that evaluate these scenarios. Purpose: To assess the number of CTC before
      and 4-5 weeks after focal stereotactic radiotherapy in single (SRS) or fractionated (SFRT)
      dose and correlate with the local and distant brain progression free survival in patients
      with metastatic breast cancer. Potential invasion markers in these cells will be evaluated
      and correlated with clinical outcome. Patients and Methods: Prospective, single-center
      research which will be developed at the Radiation Oncology Department of AC Camargo Cancer
      Center. Patients with diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer to the brain with an indication
      of focal radiotherapy, SRS or SFRT, will be recruited. The blood will be collected and
      processed for analysis of CTC by the ISET method (Rarecells, France). The invasion markers
      (HER-2, COX-2, EGFR, Notch 1 and ST6GALNAC5) will be analyzed on CTC by immunocytochemistry.
      Expected Results: If our hypothesis is proven, we may include the analysis and
      quantification of CTC in clinical practice as early indicator of local or distant recurrence
      in the brain.
