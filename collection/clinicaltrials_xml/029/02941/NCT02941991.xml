  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of hESC-RPE cellular
      therapy in patients with advanced SMD over a five-year period following the surgical
      procedure to implant the cells.

    <textblock>
      This study is a long-term, extension of a Phase I/II, open-label, non-randomized, 4-cohort,
      multi-center clinical trial (referred to as the core trial or core protocol) in which a
      maximum of 12 SMD patients were transplanted with sequential doses of hESC-RPE cells,
      starting at a dose of 50,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted and increasing to a maximum dose of
      200,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted.

      Eligible patients will be those who sign a consent form for the extension study, and who
      fulfill all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      The first visit of this extension protocol will correspond to the last visit of the core
      protocol, and will take place at 12 months post-cell implantation.

      During the first year after completion of the core protocol, i.e. from Year 1 to Year 2
      post-transplantation, the patients will be evaluated at approximately 6-month intervals;
      during Year 3, Year 4 and Year 5 post-transplantation, patients will be evaluated annually.

      Follow-up will include obtaining information about visual acuity, ophthalmological findings
      and adverse events (AEs), specifically including cancer, neurological, autoimmune or
      hematological disorders that developed or worsened since the last visit.
