      The ASQ-Fr study aims at validating the French version of Ask Suicide-Screening Questions
      composed of 5 items in adolescents managed in pediatric emergency department. Therefore, use
      of this brief valid screening instrument could assess the risk for suicide in pediatric
      patients and then improve the prevention of suicidal tendencies in this population.

    <textblock>
      ASQ-Fr is a prospective, cross-sectional instrument-validation study evaluated 5 candidate
      screening questions assessing suicide risk in adolescents between 10 and 18 years of age
      managed in two urban, pediatric emergency departments associated with tertiary care
      hospitals.

      ASQ-Fr questionnaire is conducted by a psychologist before or after the French version of
      the SIQ/SIQ Junior (Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire), depending on the randomisation in the
      unit. SIQ is composed of 30 items and valid for adolescents aged 15 years or more. SIQ
      Junior is composed of 15 items and valid for children up to 14 years old.

      Questionnaires are followed by an interview in adolescents and parents separately by the
      psychologist to evaluate perceptions, feasibility and acceptability of questionnaires.

      It is planned a convenience sample of 200 patients aged 10 to 18 years who presented with
      either medical or surgical chief concerns to the emergency department.
