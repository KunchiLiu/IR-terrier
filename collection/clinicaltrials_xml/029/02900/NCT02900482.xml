    <textblock>
      The main objective is to identify the genes involved in congenital dislocation of the hip.

      The secondary objectives are to measure the association between mechanical risk factors and
      congenital dislocation of hip and study the interactions between these factors and genetic
      factors.

    <textblock>
      Congenital hip dislocation (CHD) is one of the most frequent skeleton abnormalities in the
      Caucasian population (incidence: 2-10 / 1000). This disease results from an abnormality of
      the reports of the femoral head with the acetabulum, generated by a morphological defect of
      the cavity and / or joint hypermobility.

      This condition is now defined as a multifactorial disease involving in the one hand,
      mechanical factors related to the conditions of pregnancy and childbirth, and secondly,
      genetic factors suggested by ethnic predisposition and familial aggregation observed.
      Despite the neonatal screening, CHD remains a public health problem because of its high
      frequency, because of the functional handicap which it leads in case of late diagnosis and
      of its natural evolution to coxarthrosis.

      CHD was the object of a significant number of publications on the difficult aspects of its
      screening and treatment but, at the moment, few data are available on the genetic factors
      involved.

      The genetic studies led on the CHD based on studies of case-control associations, focused on
      candidate genes, and genetic linkage analysis, two strategies classically used in genetic
      epidemiology.

      To date, these strategies did not allow to elucidate the genetic determinism of the
      pathology.

      The considerable progress made in recent years both in the field of knowledge of the human
      genome and its variability, in the development of methodological and technological tools
      allow to better understand the genetic determinism of complex diseases such as CHD.

      The development of the techniques of broadband sequencing, new generation said sequencing
      (NGS for Next Generation Sequencing) makes indeed accessible the sequencing of the whole
      genome or of the set of its coding regions (exome) and now allows identify rare variants,
      that is to say variants having a minor allele frequency of less than 1%. These variants were
      previously not recognizable by the strategies traditionally used in genetic epidemiology,
      which are based on the study of common variants (minor allele frequency of ≥ 5%) listed in
      the public databases of the human genome .

      The NGS sequencing technique makes it possible to address the problem of the study of
      complex diseases in a new light and it appears necessary to apply this strategy to the CHD
      to search for genetic factors involved in the pathology.
