      The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to evaluate the safety, antitumor activity and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of MAK683 in patients with advanced malignancies such as
      Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) or other advanced
      solid tumors for whom no further effective standard treatment is available.

      The purpose phase I of this trial is to characterize safety and tolerability and determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MAK683.

      The purpose of the phase II of this trial will be to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of
      MAK683.
