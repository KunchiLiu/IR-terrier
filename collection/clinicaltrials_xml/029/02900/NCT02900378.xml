    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, actively controlled, double-blind study is to demonstrate
      the superiority of sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril in increasing non-sedentary physical
      activity chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction. Physical activity
      will be continuously measured by means of a wrist-worn accelerometry device from 2 weeks
      before until 12 weeks after start of study therapy (sacubitril/valsartan or enalapril).

    <description>The Patient Global Assessment(PGA) is a self-reported tool to assess the patients' subjective rating of their disease activity widely used in HF research. The patients are asked to report functioning or response to an intervention by rating their current condition compared to their pre-intervention condition on a numerical scale: 1) much improved 2) moderately improved 3) a little improved 4) unchanged 5) a little worse 6) moderately worse or 7) much worse.</description>

             disease, obstructive or restrictive lung disease, malignant disease, neurological
             disorders (e.g. Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease, central and peripheral
             neuroinflammatory and -degenerative disorders or functional central nervous lesions
             due to hemodynamic or traumatic incidents), injuries (incl. diabetic foot ulcers) or
             missing limbs

          -  Patients with palsy, tremor or rigor affecting the non-dominant arm.

          -  Patients with any skin or other condition of the non-dominant arm that would limit
             the ability to wear the actigraphy device continuously (24h/day) over 14 weeks.

          -  Patients fully depending on a mobility support system, e.g. wheelchair, scooter or
             walker. Patients are allowed to use a cane as long as this is not used with the
             non-dominant arm.
