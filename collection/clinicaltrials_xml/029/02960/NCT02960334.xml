      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) It is the most common arrhythmia in the world. It carries great
      public health significance because of its prevalence, additional morbidity and mortality. It
      provides a 4-5 times higher risk of developing a ischemic stroke or transient ischemic
      attack. In term, this risk can be 70% reduced by taking oral anticoagulants. Actionable AF
      is the overarching term for silent AF (asymptomatic AF) and undertreated AF (known AF, but
      not sufficiently protected against ischemic stroke). It is recommended that over the age of
      65, patients should be screened with pulse palpation or rhythm strip for the presence of AF.
      The MyDiagnostick is a single-lead I, compact hand-held device that analyses heart rhythm
      during one minute. During preoperative consultation, this device will be used to value the
      yield of screening for actionable AF.

    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the world, with a prevalence
      ranging from 1.9 - 2.3% and rising. It is known that the disease occurs more often as age
      progresses: 70% of affected cases are aged between 65 and 85, over 80 years, one is 10-18%
      likely to be carrying the illness. Multiple risk factors for developing AF have been
      determined, like hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, valvular heart disease,
      obesity, DM and hyperthyroidism.

      AF potentially leads to thrombus formation, resulting in a 4-5 times increased risk of
      getting a TIA or ischemic infarction.

      Taking a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains the golden standard, with the absence of
      distinct P-waves and a RR interval that is irregularly irregular.

      AF is a risk factor and a risk marker for developing ischemic stroke, by providing a
      prothrombotic environment. This makes a patient with AF 4-5 times more susceptible for
      getting an ischemic stroke. Protection for this risk is done by prescribing oral
      anticoagulants (OAC) (according to an individuals CHA2DS2VASc-score) by either Vitamin-K
      antagonists (VKAs) or Novel Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs). This allows for a 70% stroke risk
      reduction.

      Not all AF is known to its carrier, it has been proven that 30% of all cases proceeds
      asymptomatic. These patients are unknowingly exposed to a higher stroke risk. Undertreated
      AF is when AF is known, but OAC is unrightfully withheld. In approximately 20% of all
      AF-related strokes, AF was known but undertreated.

      In view of the increasing prevalence of AF, it seems there is a need for screening for
      prevention of actionable AF-associated strokes. The European Society of Cardiology discloses
      in their most recent guideline that opportunistic screening appears feasible and
      cost-effective in patients older than 65 years, to be performed by either pulse taking or
      ECG rhythm strip. The MyDiagnostick, a compact hand-held, 1-lead ECG recorder was created to
      fulfil the need for better large scale screening devices. In one minute it distinguishes
      irregular rhythms from normal cardiac rhythms and it can store over 120 ECGs. In a study of
      192 patients the MyDiagnostick showed to be 100% sensitive for detecting AF and had a
      specificity of 95.9%. It provided in a study in which the prevalence of silent AF was
      examined during influenza vaccination in 10 general practices with more than 3000 patients.
      From a total of 3269 screened patients, 121 (3,7%) cases of AF were detected, whereof 37
      (1,1%) had not yet been diagnosed before.

      In this study, the yield of opportunistic screening will be tested of all patients aged 65
      or older during preoperative consultation with the MyDiagnostick

        Every patient &gt; 64 years can participate in the trial. Patients who visit the preoperative
        consultation (e.g. before surgery) will be asked to hold the MyDiagnostick for one minute.
