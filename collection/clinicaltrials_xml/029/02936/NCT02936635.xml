      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of tirasemtiv
      in patients with ALS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants will begin dosing of tirasemtiv 125 mg twice daily (250 mg/day) for a
      period of 4 weeks and will titrate to their tolerated dose, the maximum dose being 250 mg
      twice daily (500 mg/day). This study will also compare the clinical course of patients who
      completed treatment with tirasemtiv in CY 4031 with those who completed treatment with
      placebo in CY 4031 during continued treatment of both groups with tirasemtiv during CY 4033,
      compare the clinical course of patients who completed treatment with tirasemtiv in CY 4031
      during that study with their clinical course during continued treatment with tirasemtiv
      during CY 4033, and compare the clinical course of patients who completed treatment with
      placebo in CY 4031 during that study with their clinical course during treatment with
      tirasemtiv during CY 4033.
