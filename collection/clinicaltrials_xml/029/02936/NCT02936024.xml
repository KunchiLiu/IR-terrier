  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undescended Testis (UDT) is the most common congenital anomaly of the genitalia in boys and
      it is commonly managed by surgical intervention. Patients with intra-abdominal or non
      palpable testis, specifically, are often managed using a laparoscopic assisted orchidopexy,
      a common surgical technique to bring undescended testes down into the scrotum. Evidence in
      the medical literature to support the superiority of either one stage or two stage
      gubernaculum sparing laparoscopic orchidopexy (GSLO) is lacking. Due to this reason, this
      study focuses on the effects of one stage versus two stage GSLO on a patient important
      outcome: testicular atrophy.

    <description>The patient will initially receive the first stage of the two-stage technique which involves the ligation of testicular vessels laparoscopically, or transection of these vessels using cautery. After the first stage is complete, the patient will be seen approximately 3-6 months later for the second stage. The second stage of the procedure involves free mobilization of the testis and placement/fixation of the testicle in the scrotum.</description>
