      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of entinostat when given together
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome after deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) therapy failure. Entinostat may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow
      and spread. Giving entinostat together with pembrolizumab may work better in treating
      patients with myelodysplastic syndrome after DNMTi therapy failure.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety, tolerability, and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      entinostat given in combination with pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of entinostat in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the dynamic quantitative change in measurable immunological biomarkers
      (proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], and programmed death protein-1
      [PD-1] expression in bone marrow) with the combined epigenetic-immunotherapy and correlation
      with any observed clinical responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of entinostat.

      Patients receive lower dose entinostat orally (PO) on days 1 and 8 or higher dose entinostat
      PO on days 1, 8, and 15, and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of
      course 2 and courses thereafter. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve an objective
      response or maintain a stable disease (SD) status after the first 4 courses may continue to
      receive entinostat and pembrolizumab for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months.
