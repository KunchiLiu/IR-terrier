      The overall research aim of this pilot study is to determine if the structural brain protein
      calpain-cleaved αII-spectrin N-terminal fragment (SNTF) can be used as a blood biomarker to
      accurately identify patients who will have more severe symptoms and reduced neurocognitive
      functioning after sustaining a concussion. Concussion is also referred to as mild traumatic
      brain injury (mTBI) in the literature. Both terms will be used interchangeably throughout
      this application.

      The novel aspect of the proposed study relates to the fact that the STNF protein is the
      first evidence that a biomarker in human blood can help clinicians determine a specific
      patient's clinical outcome from a concussion. This in turn will help clinicians and
      concussion specialists with designing treatment protocols very early after the initial
      injury that could have significant impacts on the health of the patient.

      This study has several important benefits to the scientific community. Concussion treatment
      today is uncertain. Some patients are back to baseline one or two days post injury whereas
      other patients are experiencing debilitating symptoms for months after the injury. Until the
      patient begins to report symptoms, the course of treatment cannot be determined. Other
      biomarkers for concussion diagnosis are being evaluated, but this is the first biomarker to
      show promise for patient stratification and earlier intervention and treatment for the
      subset of cases at high risk of suffering brain damage and persisting dysfunction after
      concussion. Currently, no prognostic method exists for identifying at an early and
      potentially treatable stage the small subset of concussion sufferers at risk of diffuse
      axonal injury and persisting brain functional impairment.

      The laboratory has developed and characterized extensively an antibody that reacts with the
      SNTF (structural brain protein calpain-cleaved αII-spectrin N-terminal fragment) fragment of
      aII-spectrin but does not recognize either the intact aII-spectrin or any other fragment of
      it. The laboratory has used this antibody as a foundation for an ultrasensitive, specific,
      standardized sandwich immunoassay for measuring trace quantities of SNTF in human serum and
      plasma in the acute period after brain injury19,27 The method employs state-of-the-art
      electrochemiluminescence chemistry that is widely used in the clinical diagnostics arena for
      measuring protein biomarkers in biological fluids.
