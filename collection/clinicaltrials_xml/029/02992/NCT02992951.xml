  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection is an infection at a place in the body where surgery has taken
      place, and has been reported in around 5% of people undergoing an operation. In vascular
      surgery, infection rates are as high as 30%. Methods to reduce this rate of infection should
      be investigated thoroughly for their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

      The investigators aim to conduct a research trial examining one such method. Leukomed
      Sorbact is a wound dressing coated with a chemical (DACC) derived from spider-silk that
      interacts with, and binds bacteria, causing them to be mechanically removed from a wound
      when the dressing is changed.The trial aims to compare the effectiveness of this dressing to
      a standard, non-coated dressing, in the reduction of surgical site infection.

      712 patients from a number of centres across the UK will be recruited to this study. Adult
      patients who are having a vascular surgery operation will be approached for entry into the
      trial. The trial will be explained to them, as well as an explanation that participation is
      voluntary and their operation or other aspects of their care will not be impacted in any way
      should participants not wish to participate.

      Participants will be randomised by computer into one of two groups - one group whose wounds
      are dressed with Leukomed Sorbact, and the other whose wounds are dressed with a standard
      dressing. Patients will be followed up at 5-7 days and 30 days, and at 1 year. At the follow
      up, their wounds will be inspected for infection, and participants will be asked to complete
      short questionnaires measuring quality of life.

      The trial will aim to answer a number of questions, with the primary question being does a
      DACC coated dressing applied after an operation reduce the risk of an infection at the
      surgery site? It will also ask whether this treatment is cost-effective and whether it
      promotes satisfactory healing.
