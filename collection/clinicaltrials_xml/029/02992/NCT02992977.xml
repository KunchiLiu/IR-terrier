    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1 study to determine the safety, feasibility, and tolerability
      of single-agent treatment with AutoSynVax™ vaccine in subjects with advanced cancer and a
      life expectancy of ≥6 months. A minimum of 6 (≤20) subjects will be enrolled to receive
      biweekly subcutaneous injection of 240 μg AutoSynVax™ vaccine + 50 μg QS-21 Stimulon®
      adjuvant for up to 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of advanced cancer that is refractory to standard therapies.

          2. No curative therapy exists and subject has received appropriate therapy known to be
             associated with clinical benefit for the condition, if it exists.

          3. Minimum estimated life expectancy of 6 months in the absence of further treatment.

          4. Age 18 years or older.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;2.

          6. Adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥1,500/mm3; absolute
             lymphocyte count [ALC] ≥500/mm3; platelet count 100,000/mm3), adequate liver function
             (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]/aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and
             alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal [IULN], total
             bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dL), and adequate renal function (creatinine &lt;1.5 x IULN).

          7. Adequate cardiac function (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class ≤II).

          8. Available tissue from an archival tissue sample or tissue from a biopsy done during
             the initial screen, or both.

          9. All participants must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method
             of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation.

         10. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the following
             intervals before first administration of study drug:

               1. ≤14 days for chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation
                  therapy. Subjects must also not have had radiation pneumonitis as a result of
                  treatment, and cannot participate in the study if they are on chronic
                  corticosteroids for radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted for
                  palliative radiation to non-CNS disease with sponsor approval.

                  Note: Bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted medications. Novel imaging
                  agents that have Phase 1 safety data and have not demonstrated therapeutic
                  activity are also permitted.

               2. ≤28 days for a prior immunotherapy.

               3. ≤28 days for prior monoclonal antibody used for anticancer therapy with the
                  exception of denosumab.

               4. ≤7 days for immunosuppressive-based treatment for any reason. Systemic
                  corticosteroids are not allowed.

                  Note: Use of inhaled or topical corticosteroid use for radiographic procedures
                  is permitted.

                  Note: The use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be approved
                  after consultation with the sponsor.

               5. ≤28 days before the first dose for all other investigational study drugs or
                  devices.

          2. Receipt of other investigational agents or other anticancer therapies during
             treatment with AutoSynVax™ vaccine.

          3. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or actively receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             trial treatment.

          4. Corticosteroid dependency.

          5. Requirement for immunosuppressive medication aside from corticosteroids.

          6. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a
             documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or
             resolved childhood asthma/atopy are an exception to this rule. Subjects who require
             intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections will not be excluded
             from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.

          7. Brain metastases or leptomeningeal spread of disease.

          8. Known endocrinopathies.

          9. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that
             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         10. Known medical, psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would preclude
             participation in the study.

         11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

         12. Known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Testing is not required
             in the absence of history or high index of suspicion.

         13. Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.

         14. Intolerance of prior immunotherapy treatment necessitating cessation of therapy.

         15. History of intolerance or allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to AutoSynVax™ vaccine or QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant.

         16. Inability to comply with protocol.
