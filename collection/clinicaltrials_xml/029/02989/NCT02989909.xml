    <textblock>
      Prospective, open-labeled, randomized, controlled, multicenter study at two clinical
      investigative sites in Tucson, Arizona. The subjects will undergo intraocular pressure
      measurement with the CATS tonometer prism and the Goldmann applanation tonometer prism
      (GAT).

      Of the 150 eyes, at least 10 highly astigmatic eyes (&gt;3 D of corneal astigmatism) each in
      the low, medium and high IOP ranges shall have the same clinical testing and analysis of
      results, with the analysis kept separate from that of the main group.
