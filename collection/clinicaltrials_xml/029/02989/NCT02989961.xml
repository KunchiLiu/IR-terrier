    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Resticutis for the
      treatment of Wagner's Grade II/III diabetic foot ulcers in comparison with Platelet-Rich and
      Platelet-Poor Plasma preparations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grade II and III (According to Wagner's classification system of Ulcer severity) are
      considered to be of the most common complications associated with Diabetes, which are mostly
      hard to heal using the conventional treatment methods which by consequence severely affects
      the quality and lifestyle of the diabetes patient.

      It's thought that the application of Autologous activated platelets &quot;Resticutis&quot; which
      secretes huge amounts of growth factors is capable of giving better results of which are:
      the stimulation of the healing process that includes contraction, granulation, tissue
      formation and epithelialization of the diabetic foot ulcer.

      Resticutis is obtained from an autologous 20 mL peripheral blood withdrawn in tubes
      containing 3.8% Sodium Citrate. Blood is then centrifuged to obtain Platelet-Rich Plasma
      -PRP- as per established method. PRP is then activated in a closed system by physical
      methods to obtain a final product of 5 mL of Resticutis which is injected intra-lesional at
      ulcer margins per each session of therapy.

      It's hypothesized that a total of six injections throughout the period of the treatment are
      enough to achieve full closure of the DFU. The injections are given on days: 0,14,28,42,56,
      and 70 of the treatment period.

      The total number of consenting patients to be studied will be calculated using standard
      statistical design and the patients will be randomized into 3 groups: One group will be
      given Resticutis, the second one Platelet-Rich Plasma PRP, and the third Platelet-Poor
      Plasma PPP. If patients in PRP and PPP groups didn't achieve full healing after six
      injections, they're given a two weeks rest after which they are given Resticutis instead.

      AutoCAD Program will be used to measure the ulcer area and to scale it and the data will be
      analyzed using the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS).
