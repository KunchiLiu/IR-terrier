      A randomized controlled trial was conducted from August 2015 through December 2016. All
      pregnant women with single pregnancies of 28 to 33 weeks and 6 days who had been experienced
      for threatened or preterm labor with intact membrane as in inclusion criteria were
      approached and ask for enrollment. The gestational age of all patients was confirmed by
      antenatal record review and ultrasonographic confirmation. Threatened preterm labor was
      defined as the presence of regular uterine contractions without significant cervical changes
      as determined by digital pelvic examination. Preterm labor was defined as the simultaneous
      presence of regular uterine contractions and cervical changes, shortening and/or softening,
      or dilatation, as determined by digital pelvic examination. The women with preterm labor
      underwent standard tocolysis, which was administered for at least 48 hours, to allow
      corticosteroid promote fetal lung maturation. The patients who had proven membranes
      ruptured, and ultrasonographically found placenta previa, multiple pregnancy, fetal anomaly
      or aneuploidy would excluded. The participants had emergency condition that required for
      emergency delivery such as fetal distress, chorioamnionitis were also excluded. Participants
      were randomized into three groups which generated by computer programme to receive whether
      oral progesterone (dydrogesterone 10 mg; Duphaston™) per oral three times a day or vaginal
      progesterone (micronized progesterone 200 mg; Utrogestan™) or no progesterone (controlled
      group). All patients were digitally pelvic examined for evaluation of Bishop score and
      assessed cervical length by transvaginal ultrasound at enrollment and follow up visit at two
      weeks apart. Cervical length was measured by standard technique with a covered probe
      inserted into vagina after each woman had emptied her bladder. Excessive pressure on cervix
      was avoided. The mean value of 3 consecutive measurements was used for analysis. Informed
      consent and demographic data were obtained at the enrollment. Primary outcomes were preterm
      delivery before 34 and 37 weeks. Secondary outcomes include time until delivery (latency
      period,days), change of cervical length (cervical attenuation), maternal outcome, neonatal
      outcome, and side effects of drugs were collected. The main outcomes of preterm delivery,
      gestational age at parturition and birthweight were also collected by telephone call in case
      of out-side-hospital born or in case loss to follow up. Monitoring of all patients was
      evaluated every follow up visit for drug side effect, allergic response, and adverse events
      Statistical analysis Sample size was calculated according to the results of two studies by
      Dorota AgataBomba - Opon and Manju Choudhary which showed significant decreased preterm
      delivery &lt;34 weeks (9.8% vs 35.3%,p=0.002) in vaginal progesterone group, and significant
      decreased preterm birth (33% vs 58% ; p= 0.034) in oral progesterone group. The sample size
      of 231 was used to evaluate the primary outcome of both drugs. Descriptive statistics were
      carried out using mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range. Categorical data
      were tested for significance with the χ2tests. Continuous data were evaluated for normal
      distribution and tested for significance with ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test. Student t test
      and Man-Whitney U test were used to test significance between groups in case there is
      significant detection in ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test among groups. Statistical
      significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.
