      This study evaluates the long- term safety and effectiveness of adalimumab in participants
      with non-infectious intermediate-, posterior-, or pan-uveitis in daily practice in Japan.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>ADR is the causal relationship between adalimumab and adverse events.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Overall improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>This is assessed by physicians.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anterior Chamber (AC) cell grade (standardization of uveitis nomenclature (SUN) criteria) in each eye</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Slit lamp examinations will be conducted at each visit to assess AC cell count. The number of AC cells observed within a 1 mm × 1 mm slit beam will be used to determine the grade according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria:
Grade 0 = &lt; 1 cell
Grade 0.5+ = 1 - 5 cells
Grade 1+ = 6 - 15 cells
Grade 2+ = 16 - 25 cells
Grade 3+ = 26 - 50 cells
Grade 4+ = &gt; 50 cells.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vitreous Haze grade in each eye</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Vitreous haze will be measured using dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy (DIO) and assessed by the Investigator according to National Eye Institute (NEI)/ SUN criteria:
Grade 0: No evident vitreous haze;
Grade 0.5+: Slight blurring of the optic disc margin because of the haze; normal striations and reflex of the nerve fiber layer cannot be visualized;
Grade 1+: Permits a better definition of both the optic nerve head and the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades);
Grade 2+: Permits better visualization of the retinal vessels (compared to higher grades);
Grade 3+: Permits the observer to see the optic nerve head, but the borders are quite blurry;
Grade 4+: Optic nerve head is obscured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in retinal lesions in each eye</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The change in retinal lesion are assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual acuity in each eye</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity change is assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VFQ)-25 score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The National Eye Institute VFQ-25 is an ocular disease-specific survey that measures the influence of visual disability and visual symptoms on generic health domains such as emotional well-being and social functioning, in addition to task-oriented domains related to daily visual functioning. The VFQ-25 consists of a base set of 25 vision-targeted questions plus an additional single-item general health rating question. The overall composite score ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores or increases in score indicate better vision-related functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in central retinal thickness in each eye</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>This is assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)</description>
