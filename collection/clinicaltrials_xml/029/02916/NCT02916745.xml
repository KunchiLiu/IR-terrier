    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of using a new
      developed bronchoscopic technology called electronavigational bronchoscopy to treat subjects
      with peripheral stage T1A non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who are inoperable or refused
      surgery, and are not candidates or refused radiation therapy. It will involve 10 sites in
      USA and Canada. Participation will last 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer accounts for almost one-third of cancer deaths. Cancer screening strategies have
      the potential to achieve a 20% reduction in death rates. Newly developed bronchoscopic
      technologies (such as navigational bronchoscopy) have shown to enable physicians to safely
      reach lesions in peripheral regions of the lung and obtain diagnosis. This new technology
      may now potentially offer bronchoscopic therapeutic interventions, such as photodynamic
      therapy, to tumors that were previously unreachable due to their peripheral anatomic
      location.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a photosensitizing drug (a drug that is
      activated by light), called porfimer sodium (Photofrin®), and a light from a laser that
      emits no heat. This technique works to allow the medical doctor to specifically target and
      destroy abnormal or cancer cells while limiting damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The
      activation of the drug is done by lighting the abnormal area using a fiber optic device
      (very fine fiber [like a fishing line] that permits light transmission) inserted into a
      flexible tube called bronchoscope. The light activates the porfimer sodium, which is
      concentrated in the abnormal tissue, leading to its destruction.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if physicians can reach the tumors in the
      periphery of the lung via electronavigational bronchoscopy and deliver the photodynamic
      therapy by placing the optical fiber into the tumor.
