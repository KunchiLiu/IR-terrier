  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will help us to learn if the medicine called metformin reduces the risk of
      death, heart attacks, and/or strokes in patients who have pre-diabetes and heart or blood
      vessel problems.

      CSP #2002 is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double blind, secondary prevention
      trial to test the hypothesis that treatment with metformin, compared with placebo, reduces
      mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with pre-diabetes and established
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Qualifying patients have pre-diabetes defined by
      HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and/or oral glucose tolerance test criteria; clinically
      evident coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral arterial atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease; and estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; and do not
      fulfill any exclusion criteria. Patients who are eligible and agree to participate are
      randomly assigned to treatment with metformin XR (titrated to a maximum dose of 2000 mg
      daily based on safety and tolerability) or matching placebo. All patients receive counseling
      on therapeutic lifestyle recommendations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-diabetes: This condition is fulfilled by HbA1c of at least 5.7%, but less than
             6.5%; two measurements of fasting blood glucose (on separate days) of 100-125 mg/dL;
             or a 2-hour blood glucose level of 140-199 mg/dL following a 75 g glucose load oral
             glucose tolerance test. These criteria must be met in the absence of diabetic
             treatment. For a participant to qualify with pre-diabetes on the basis of

             HbA1c or oral glucose tolerance testing, the results must have been obtained within 5
             months prior to the date of the screening visit, to ensure that the data are no more
             than 6 months prior to randomization. If HbA1c was measured more than once during
             this time period, an average value of at least 5.7%, but less than 6.5%, will
             determine qualification. To qualify with pre-diabetes on the basis of two fasting
             blood glucose levels of 100-125 mg/dL, testing must be performed during the period
             beginning with the screening visit and prior to the randomization visit, with
             documentation of fasting (no caloric intake) for at least 8 hours prior to blood
             sampling. To qualify with pre-diabetes on the basis of two fasting blood glucose
             levels of 100-125 mg/dL, testing must be performed during the period beginning with
             the screening visit and prior to the randomization visit, with documentation of
             fasting (no caloric intake) for at least 8 hours prior to blood sampling. Any or all
             qualifying laboratory values may have been obtained in either a VA or a non-VA
             laboratory, but in either case the laboratory source documents, including date(s) of
             testing and test results must be available and data recorded on the appropriate case
             report form

          2. Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: Qualifying participants must have

             infarction; or iii) regional wall motion abnormality consistent with infarction. (2)
             History of percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery at
             least one month prior to randomization (3) Angiographic evidence of significant
             coronary stenosis: At least 50% luminal stenosis in at least 2 major epicardial
             vessels (left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex, or right coronary
             arteries).

             b) Cerebrovascular disease: Fulfilled by at least one of criteria (1) through (4):
