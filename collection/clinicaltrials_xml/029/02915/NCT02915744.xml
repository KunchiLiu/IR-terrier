      This is an open-label, randomized, active comparator, multicenter, international Phase 3
      study of NKTR-102 versus TPC in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have stable brain
      metastases and have been previously treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, and
      capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting (prior anthracycline may be
      omitted if medically appropriate or contraindicated for the patient).

      This is an open-label, randomized, active comparator, multicenter, international Phase 3
      study of NKTR-102 versus TPC in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have stable brain
      metastases and have been previously treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, and
      capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting (prior anthracycline may be
      omitted if medically appropriate or contraindicated for the patient).

      In Group A, NKTR-102 will be administered at a dose level of 145 mg/m2 on a q21d schedule as
      a 90-minute intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. In Group B, TPC will
      be administered per standard of care. Patients randomized to TPC will receive single-agent
      IV chemotherapy, limited to choice of one of the following 7 agents: eribulin, ixabepilone,
      vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or nab-paclitaxel.

      This study will randomize approximately 350 patients using a 1:1 randomization ratio and
      stratification based on geographic region, tumor receptor status, and Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG) status. At Screening, the Investigator must determine which TPC will
      be offered to the patient.

      Data will be collected on subsequent anticancer therapies in both treatment groups from the
      time patients come off the study treatment until the time of primary data analysis for OS.

      An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will assess interim safety and efficacy data.

    <description>To compare Overall Survival (OS) of patients who receive 145 mg/m2 NKTR-102 given once every 21 days (q21d) with OS of patients who receive Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC). Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Patients will be followed until their date of death or until final database closure. Patients who are lost-to-follow-up or are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive or at the date of event cut-off for OS analysis.</description>
