    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to describe the safety and immunogenicity of the 0.5-mL dose (15 μg
      HA per strain) of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine in children 6 through 35 months of age.

      Primary objective:

        -  To compare the rate of any fever (temperature ≥ 100.4°F [38.0°C]) following the 0.5-mL
           dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine to that following the 0.25 mL dose of Fluzone
           Quadrivalent vaccine during the 7 days after either vaccination (Dose 1 and Dose 2
           combined) in subjects 6 to &lt; 36 months of age.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To compare antibody responses induced by the 0.5-mL dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent
           vaccine to those induced by the 0.25-mL dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine as
           assessed by geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios and seroconversion rate differences after
           the final vaccination in subjects 6 to &lt; 36 months of age.

      Other objectives:

        -  To describe the safety of 2 different dose levels of the 2016-2017 formulation of
           Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine in subjects 6 to &lt; 36 months of age.

        -  To describe the immunogenicity of 2 different dosages of the 2016-2017 formulation of
           Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine in subjects 6 months to &lt; 36 months of age.

        -  To submit available sera from approximately 30 subjects to the Center for Biologics
           Evaluation and Research for further analysis by the World Health Organization, the
           Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the FDA to support formulation
           recommendations for subsequent influenza vaccines.

      All participants will receive 1 intramuscular dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine during
      Visit 1. Participants, for whom 2 doses of influenza vaccine are recommended per Advisory
      Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance, will receive a second dose of Fluzone
      Quadrivalent vaccine during Visit 2 (28 days after Visit 1).

      Solicited adverse event (AE) information will be collected for 7 days after each
      vaccination, unsolicited AE information will be collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2 or to
      Visit 3 for those subjects receiving 2 doses. Serious adverse event information will be
      collected from Visit 1 to Visit 2 or Visit 3, as appropriate.

      Immunogenicity will be evaluated in all subjects prior to vaccination on Day 0 (Visit 1) and
      at Day 28 after the final vaccination.
