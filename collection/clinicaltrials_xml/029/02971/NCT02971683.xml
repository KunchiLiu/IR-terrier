        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of IIM using the Bohan and Peter classification criteria: i) Subjects with
             dermatomyositis (DM) must also have a confirmed myositis-associated rash (Gottron's
             papules or a heliotrope rash preferably confirmed by skin biopsy) or a prior muscle
             biopsy diagnostic for IIM or a positive test for at least one identified
             myositis-associated autoantibody; ii) Subjects with IIM other than DM must also have
             a prior muscle biopsy diagnostic for IIM or a positive test for at least one
             identified myositis-associated autoantibody

          -  Demonstrable muscle weakness measured by the MMT-8 of ≤ 135 units and any 3 of the
             following: i) MMT-8 ≤ 125 units; ii) Physician's global assessment (PGA) visual
             analog scale (VAS) ≥2 cm; iii) Subject's global assessment (SGA) VAS ≥2 cm; iv)
             HAQ-DI ≥ 0.5; v) One or more muscle enzyme (CK, aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase
             (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT) ≥ 1.3 times upper limit of normal
             (ULN); vi) MDAAT Extramuscular Global Activity VAS ≥2 cm

          -  Demonstration of currently active IIM will be determined by an adjudication committee
             unless the subject has any one of the following: i) an active myositis-associated
             rash (Gottron's papules or heliotrope rash), or ii) a recent (within 1 month prior to
             signing informed consent) biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or electromyogram
             (EMG) demonstrating active disease, or iii) an elevated CK &gt; 5 times the upper limit
             of normal

          -  Active disease despite prior treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or
             biologics as determined by the investigator

          -  The subject must be on background standard treatment for IIM. The standard treatments
             that are allowed as background treatment for IIM includes: i) Corticosteroids alone,
             or ii) One of the following immunosuppressants: methotrexate, azathioprine,
             mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, or cyclosporine (combinations of these treatments
             are not allowed), or iii) A combination of corticosteroids and one of the above
             immunosuppressants. The subject must have been on the same medication(s) for IIM for
             12 weeks prior to randomization and the dose must have been stable for 4 weeks prior
             to randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with drug-induced myositis, Inclusion Body Myositis, cancer-associated
             myositis

          -  Subjects treated with penicillamine or zidovudine in the past 3 months

          -  Subjects treated with rituximab in the past year or any other biologic treatment or
             Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the past 6 months.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled or rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease

          -  Subjects with severe muscle damage (Myositis Damage Index &lt; 3/10), permanent weakness
             due to a non-IIM cause, or myositis with cardiac involvement

          -  Subjects at risk for tuberculosis

          -  Subjects with recent acute infection requiring antibiotics

          -  Subjects with history of chronic or recurrent bacterial, viral or systemic fungal
             infections

          -  Subjects who have a present malignancy or have had a previous malignancy within the
             last 5 years prior to screening (except for a documented history of cured
             non-metastatic squamous or basal cell skin carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ).
