    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well osimertinib with or without bevacizumab
      works in treating patients with EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to
      the brain. Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving osimertinib with or without bevacizumab
      may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival with osimertinib plus bevacizumab compared to
      osimertinib alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of osimertinib and bevacizumab.

      II. To evaluate the time to progression in the central nervous system (CNS) with osimertinib
      plus bevacizumab versus single-agent osimertinib.

      III. To determine the overall response rate and the intracranial response rate to the
      combination versus single agent.

      IV. To assess the overall survival in patients receiving osimertinib plus bevacizumab
      compared to osimertinib alone.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to combination osimertinib plus
      bevacizumab versus osimertinib by molecularly characterizing tumor samples including T790M
      status.

      II. To assess whether circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in plasma can be used as
      an indicator of sensitivity and resistance to treatment.

      III. To determine whether an angiogenic signature using a multiplex panel array is
      associated with benefit from the combination of osimertinib plus bevacizumab.

      IV. To investigate angiogenesis, immune and signaling pathway markers in tumor samples to
      determine biomarkers predictive of benefit from combination therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-12 and bevacizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive osimertinib PO QD on days 1-12.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for a minimum of 4 weeks.
