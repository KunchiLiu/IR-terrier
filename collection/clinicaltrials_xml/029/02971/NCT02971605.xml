  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study will assess whether ingestion of a classic hallucinogen
      (psilocybin) leads to changes in emotion processing and neural circuitry that may predict
      repeated self-administration of this drug and underlie an atypical mechanism of abuse
      liability, which may vitally contribute to our understanding of the potential for abuse and
      the underlying mechanisms supporting abuse of classic hallucinogens.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have given written informed consent

             English

          -  Be healthy and psychologically stable as determined by screening for medical and
             psychiatric problems via a personal interview, a medical questionnaire, a physical
             examination, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and routine medical blood and urinalysis
             laboratory tests

          -  Agree to consume approximately the same amount of caffeine-containing beverage (e.g.,
             coffee, tea) that he/she consumes on a usual morning, before arriving at the research
             unit on the morning of the drug session day. If the participant does not routinely
             consume caffeinated beverages, he/she must agree not to do so on the session day.

          -  Agree to refrain from using any psychoactive drugs, including alcoholic beverages and
             nicotine, within 24 hours of each drug administration. The exception is caffeine.

          -  Agree not to take any &quot;as needed&quot; medications on the mornings of drug sessions

          -  Agree not to take sildenafil (ViagraÂ®), tadalafil, or similar medications within 72
             hours of each drug administration.

          -  Agree that for one week before each drug session, he/she will refrain from taking any
             nonprescription medication, nutritional supplement, or herbal supplement except when
             approved by the study investigators. Exceptions will be evaluated by the study
             investigators and will include acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
             and common doses of vitamins and minerals.

          -  Have limited lifetime use of hallucinogens (at least one prior use of a hallucinogen,
             but preference will be given to those with the fewest number of prior exposures to a
             hallucinogen)

          -  Last hallucinogen use was at least 3 months ago (but preference will be given to
             those with a greater duration of time since last hallucinogen use)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant (as indicated by a positive urine pregnancy test assessed at
             intake and before each drug session) or nursing; women who are of child-bearing
             potential and sexually active who are not practicing an effective means of birth
             control.

          -  Cardiovascular conditions: coronary artery disease, stroke, angina, uncontrolled
             hypertension, a clinically significant ECG abnormality (e.g., atrial fibrilation),
             artificial heart valve, or stroke in the past year

          -  Epilepsy with history of seizures

             hypoglycemia

          -  Currently taking psychoactive prescription medication on a regular (e.g., daily)
             basis

          -  Currently taking on a regular (e.g., daily) basis any medications having a primary
             centrally-acting serotonergic effect, including mono-amine oxidase inhibitors
             (MAOIs). For individuals who have intermittent or &quot;as needed&quot; use of such
             medications, psilocybin sessions will not be conducted until at least 5 half-lives of
             the agent have elapsed after the last dose.

          -  More than 20% outside the upper or lower range of ideal body weight according to
             Metropolitan Life height and weight table

          -  Current or past history of meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental

             moderate or severe alcohol or drug use disorder (excluding caffeine and nicotine)

          -  Have a first or second-degree relative with schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic
             disorders (except substance/medication-induced or due to another medical condition),
