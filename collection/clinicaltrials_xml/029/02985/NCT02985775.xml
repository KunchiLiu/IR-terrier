  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, especially in patients received
      haploidentical transplantation. During the past decades, prophylactic or preemptive
      treatment with antiviral drugs has significantly reduce the incidence of early-onset CMV
      infection. Unfortunately, prolonged antiviral treatment is associated with substantial
      toxicity and may delay recovery of virus specific immune responses, resulting in an
      increasing of late-onset CMV disease.

      To date, adoptive immunotherapies have been developed as treatment alternatives to antiviral
      agents for CMV infection after HSCT. Studies have demonstrated that prophylactic or
      preemptive therapy with donor CMV-specific T cells can restore antiviral immunity and clear
      CMV viremia after transplantation. In this prospective clinical phase I/II trial, we propose
      to reconstitute antiviral immunity against CMV by preemptive transfer of CMVpp65-specific T
      cells (CMV-CTLs) at an early time point after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We also
      propose to demonstrate whether protect against CMV is associated with recovery of CMV-CTLs.

      ALL patients enrolled into this clinical trial are standard risk patients diagnosed with
      acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and received haploidentical blood and
      marrow transplantation. When patients develop acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD),
      CMVpp65-specific T cells will be generated and transferred to the aGVHD controlled
      patients(patients who do not develop aGVHD are at low risk of refractory CMV infection, and
      are not include in treated group). Physical exams and blood tests will be performed -2w, -0d
      before and +1d, +2w, +4w, +8w, +12w, +24w after adoptive CMV-CTL transfusion. The end points
      were safety and clinical and immunologic response. Following time is 12 months.
