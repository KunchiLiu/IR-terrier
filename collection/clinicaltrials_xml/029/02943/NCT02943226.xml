  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare two types of catheters used for infusing
      the contrast dye necessary for viewing internal organs during computed tomography (CT)
      scanning. The standard catheter, which has one hole from which contrast dye enters veins,
      will be compared to the Becton Dickinson Nexiva Diffusics System catheter, which has three
      holes for diffusing dye into veins. The purpose of this study is to determine which catheter
      type gives the best image.

    <measure>Image quality as assessed by ratio of tissue density of liver to the aorta</measure>
    <time_frame>at the time of CT scanning</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio of tissue density measured in the liver to tissue density in the aorta on the CT images will be determined and will provide a measure of biodistribution, which is an important indicator of image quality. Dividing each Hounsfield unit measurement by the aorta density and determining these ratios will be done on a per patient basis to assess biodistribution as a measure of image quality.</description>
