      The ABSORB Post-Approval Clinical Study is a prospective, open-label, multi-center,
      single-arm, non-randomized trial designed to observe Absorb continued safety during
      commercial use in real world settings.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After approval of commercial use of Absorb GT1 Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) System
      in over 75 countries as of December 31, 2015, Abbott Vascular has developed a post-approval
      commitment plan that includes the initiation of the ABSORB Post-Approval Clinical Study, a
      single-arm trial that will include approximately 3000 subjects at approximately 265 sites in
      the US and Canada.

      The objectives of ABSORB PostApproval Study are the following:

        -  Evaluate the safety of the use of Absorb in a real world setting following commercial
           physician training.

        -  Observe the effectiveness of commercial physician training on appropriate vessel sizing
           in the use of Absorb in a real world setting.

      The study design allows evaluating low frequency events, effectiveness of commercial
      physician training and education for very small vessels (&lt; 2.25 mm as assessed by
      quantitative coronary angiography (QCA)), and confirmation of generalizability of the
      treatment with Absorb to real-world practice. The clinical followup will occur at 30 days,
      180 days, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years by investigator or designee through telephone contacts
      or office visits.

      Angiographic Subgroup:

      Approximately the first 500 consecutive subjects implanted by operators inexperienced in the
      usage of Absorb GT1 BVS to receive baseline assessment of reference vessel diameter (RVD) by
      the angiographic core laboratory. An inexperienced operator is defined as having performed
      two or fewer Absorb implants prior to commercial approval. The purpose of the angiographic
      subgroup is to evaluate the effectiveness of training in the selection of appropriately
      sized coronary arteries for GT1 BVS implantation. Study staff will be notified after the
      procedure if the subject is in the angiographic subgroup, and instructed to send
      pre-procedure angiogram and supporting materials to core laboratory for assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject agrees and signs the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed
             consent form

          -  The subject receives an Absorb

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a member of a vulnerable population.

        Vulnerable population: Defined as subject whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical
        investigation could be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of
        benefits associated with participation or of retaliatory response from senior members of a
        hierarchy in case of refusal to participate. Examples of populations which may contain
        vulnerable subjects include: Individuals with lack of or loss of autonomy due to
        immaturity or through mental disability, persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished
        persons, subjects in emergency situations, ethnic minority groups, homeless persons,
        nomads, refugees, and those incapable of giving informed consent. Other vulnerable
        subjects include, for example, members of a group with a hierarchical structure such as
        university students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of the
        sponsor, members of the armed forces, and persons kept in detention
