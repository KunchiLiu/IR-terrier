  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cycle Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Cycle) is developing an oral tablet formulation of
      Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride and intends to conduct bioequivalence trials to demonstrate its
      similarity to the RLD.

      The aim of this pilot study is to investigate intrasubject variability in the
      bioavailability of Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride 25 mg sugar coated tablets.

      Cycle aims to demonstrate that Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride has a shallow dose response
      curve and a wide safety margin. This will then allow for the modification of bioequivalence
      acceptance criteria in future pivotal studies which will reduce the number of participants
      required whilst still maintaining assurance of safety and efficacy.

      Pilot Subjects (n): 20 Periods: 2 (2xR) Dosing: Single-dose Strength: 25 mg Test Product:
      N/A Reference: USL PHARMA Chlorpromazine Hydrochloride Analytes (in plasma): Chlorpromazine;
      7-Hydroxychlorpromazine Bioequivalence based on 90% CI (Cmax, AUC): Standard; 80.00 -
      125.00%

      This will be a single-dose, open-label, two-period replicate pilot study with orally
      administered chlorpromazine hydrochloride 25 mg (sugar coated tablets) conducted under
      fasting conditions in at least 16 healthy male and female subjects at a single study center.

      Up to 20 eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study with 16 evaluable subjects to
      complete the study.

      Analytes to be measured will be Chlorpromazine and 7-hydroxy-Chlorpromazine (free) as
      stipulated by FDA Guidance for assessment of bioequivalence for Chlorpromazine.

             electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory investigations must be clinically acceptable
             or within laboratory reference ranges for the relevant laboratory tests, unless the

                  hysterectomy, amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months and considered post-menopausal, Note:
                  In postmenopausal women, the value of the serum pregnancy test may be slightly
                  increased. This test will be repeated to confirm the results. If there is no
                  increase indicative of pregnancy, the female will be included in the study.

             OR

               -  Of childbearing potential, the following conditions are to be met:

               -  Negative pregnancy test

               -  If this test is positive, the subject will be excluded from the study. In the
                  rare circumstance that a pregnancy is discovered after the subject received IMP,

                  with the same method throughout the study. Examples of reliable methods of
                  contraception include non-hormonal intrauterine device, and barrier methods
                  combined with an additional contraceptive method.

             In this study the concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives is NOT allowed. Other
             methods, if considered by the investigator as reliable, will be accepted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of psychiatric disorder, antagonistic personality, poor motivation,
             emotional or intellectual problems likely to limit the validity of consent to
             participate in the study or limit the ability to comply with protocol requirements.

             In this study the concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives is NOT allowed.

          6. Participation in another study with an experimental drug, where the last
             administration of the previous IMP was within 8 weeks (or within 10 elimination

             first administration of IMP.

         20. Diagnosis of hypotension made during the screening period.

         21. Diagnosis of hypertension made during the screening period or current diagnosis of
             hypertension.

         22. Resting pulse of &gt; 100 beats per minute or &lt; 40 beats per minute during the screening
