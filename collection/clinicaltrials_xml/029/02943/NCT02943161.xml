    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether treatment with L-citrulline, which is an amino acid found
      in some foods, can increase levels of L-arginine and thereby restore the concentration of
      nitric oxide (NO) in the airways.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that some obese asthmatics have a metabolic imbalance in which L-arginine
      levels are reduced. L-arginine is an amino acid that is used to make NO, a gas that is
      normally made in the bronchi and ensures that the lungs function properly. In this pilot
      study subjects with asthma that have an increased body mass index compatible with being
      obese, will be invited to participate in a short open-label treatment with 15g/day of
      L-citrulline for two weeks. Study participants will be asked to do lung function testing and
      donate blood before and after taking the supplement. L-citrulline is safe and well tolerated
      and has been used at much higher doses without significant side effects.

          -  Smoking history &lt;10 pack years and no smoking in the last year

          -  V1 eNO ≤ 25ppb

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Respiratory tract infection within the 4 weeks prior to the study (may re-enroll
             after 4 weeks).

          -  Oral or systemic corticosteroid burst (for any indication) within the 4 weeks

          -  One-time doses, such as intra-articular injections into a shoulder or knee joint,
             require a 2-week washout.

          -  Asthma-related ER visit within the previous 4 weeks of Visit 0
