    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability of 1 to 3 concept
      formulations of JNJ-53718678 compared to the currently existing oral solution, and to assess
      the effect of food on the bioavailability of 1 to 3 oral concept formulations of
      JNJ-53718678 when administered as a single oral dose of 500 milligram (mg) in healthy adult
      participants.

    <time_frame>Up to 72 hour of Post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC (0-last) is the area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable non-below quantification limit concentration, calculated by liner-linear trapezoidal summation.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 72 hour of Post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C(last)/lambda(z)Í¾ wherein AUC(last) is area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant.</description>

    <description>The relative bioavailability based on Cmax, AUC(0last), and AUC(0-inf) will be estimated as 100*Test/Reference, where Test is defined as the pharmacokinetic parameters of oral JNJ-53718678 and Reference is defined as currently existing oral solution G024.</description>
