    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between heavy alcohol use, pain,
      and response to pain medication in older adults. We hypothesize that heavy alcohol use may
      impact health physiology.

      Potential participants complete a phone screen. If still found eligible, the participant
      comes in for 1 screening visit (3 hours long). Cognitive/problem solving tests, computerized
      tasks, CPT, and questionnaires are given. A blood draw is done to determine eligibility. If
      the participant is still eligible, he/she comes back for 1 full study day visit (9-10 hours
      long). A testing battery (very similar to the one done during the screening visit) is done
      in the morning. Study medication is then administered, and additional testing batteries are
      done throughout the day. Blood draws, vital signs, and pupil measurements are taken
      throughout the day. A follow-up phone call is completed within a few days of the full study
      day visit, during which a questionnaire is given.
