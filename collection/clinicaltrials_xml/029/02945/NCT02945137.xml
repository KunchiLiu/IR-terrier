    <textblock>
      The accurate diagnosis of H. pylori infection is an important step for establishing the
      strategy for gastric cancer prevention. During endoscopy, rapid urease test (RUT) is the
      first of biopsy-based H. pylori tests. Despite indirect test for H. pylori detection, RUT
      shows rapid result with good sensitivity and specificity. Several study reported that H.
      pylori density was related to positive reaction time of RUT. However, there was no study
      comparing the positive reaction times of RUT according to biopsy site, degree of gastric
      atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia.

      The aims of this study were to: (1) assess the positive reaction times of RUT in the body
      and antrum, (2) investigate the association between the difference of RUT results (body and
      antrum) and gastric atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia, and (3) evaluate the optimal biopsy
      site for RUT according to degree of gastric atrophy in Korean population.

        The subjects who underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were enrolled in this study
        at a single, tertiary-care, academic medical center. During endoscopy, rapid urease tests
        would be performed in the body and antrum.
