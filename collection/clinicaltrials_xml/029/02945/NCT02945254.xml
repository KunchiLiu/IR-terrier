  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insufficient and low-quality sleep is a major public health problem that has been linked to
      motor vehicle crashes, industrial disasters, and medical and other occupational errors.
      Persons experiencing sleep insufficiency are also more likely to suffer from chronic
      diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and obesity, as well as from cancer,
      increased mortality, and reduced quality of life and productivity.

      The number of people using sleep-inducing drugs to increase or improve sleep is steadily
      increasing in the last few decades; however, the side effects of these therapies often
      outweigh the benefits.

      A few small trials and anecdotal findings suggest that continuous background (pink or white)
      noise overnight can improve sleep quality, increase acoustic arousal threshold, and reduce
      sleep onset latency.

      In an attempt to find new, alternative solutions to increase sleep quality in people
      suffering from insomnia, the investigators would like to test the effect of surrounding
      filtered white noise on sleep onset latency and subjective sleep quality in healthy
      subjects.
