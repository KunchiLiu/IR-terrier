  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication is a common condition in the elderly
      population and is characterized by bilateral buttock, thigh, or calf discomfort and/or pain,
      as well as by weakness precipitated by walking and prolonged standing. Self-management
      options include physical therapy, which includes exercise as a core component for improving
      the flexibility and mobility of the spine and hips. A Williams flexion protocol has
      historically been used to treat low-back pain following degenerative changes to the
      posterior elements of the lumbar spine. However, few studies have been done to validate the
      efficacy of this protocol. A more individualized treatment protocol may be more efficacious.
      Patients in this study will be randomized to receive either the conservative physical
      therapy protocol or the individualized regimen. Outcomes will be assessed using validated
      questionnaires and physical function tests.
