  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase II safety and efficacy study of
      combination therapy with pembrolizumab and PEG-Intron (Peginterferon alpha-2b) in patients
      with advanced cholangiocarcinoma who have progressed on or cannot tolerate frontline
      chemotherapy. PEG-Intron will be administered to patients as a 3ug/kg (subject to possible
      dose modification) subcutaneous injection weekly, while pembrolizumab will be administered
      as a 200mg IV infusion once every three weeks, starting on week 4 (at the same time as the
      4th dose of PEG-Intron). This trial design provides an initial window (3 weeks) to evaluate
      the effect of PEG-Intron alone on tumor microenvironment in comparison to that of prior
      therapy: a biopsy prior to treatment will be collected, followed by a, repeat tumor biopsies
      collected while the patients receive PEG-Intron. Tumor tissue will be collected and analyzed
      as described in the next paragraph.

    <textblock>
      If survival is to be further improved in patients with cholangiocarcinoma, new approaches
      are urgently needed to prevent tumor recurrence after surgical resection of
      cholangiocarcinomas. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the programmed
      death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby
      releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including a strong
      anti-tumor immune response. Prognostic impact of tumor-infiltrating immune cells on biliary
      tract cancer was studied in a retrospective study of 375 patients with cholangiocarcinoma.
      High levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in cholangiocarcinoma were associated with
      good clinical outcome. Therapies that target the PD-1 receptor have shown yet unmatched
      rates of lasting clinical responses in patients with a number of cancer types. The response
      rate of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma was 17% in a phase I
      study. Interferon alpha 2b has been shown to increase tumor immune infiltrates. The
      investigators propose to combine Sylatron with pembrolizumab to improve the response rate of
      pembrolizumab. It is hypothesized that Sylatron will improve the response rate of
      pembrolizumab from 17% to 35% by increasing the immune cell infiltrate into the tumor.

             interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         20. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
