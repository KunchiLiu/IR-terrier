  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study to test Sym013 (Pan-HER) in humans. The primary purpose of this
      study is to see if Pan-HER is safe and effective for patients with advanced epithelial
      malignancies without available therapeutic options.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter trial composed of 2 parts in which Pan-HER will be
      evaluated when administered by the intravenous (IV) route on a weekly schedule in patients
      with advanced epithelial malignancies without available therapeutic options. Four (4) doses
      of Pan-HER administered weekly constitute 1 cycle.

      Part 1 is a Phase 1a dose-escalation designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D).

      Part 2 is a Phase 2a dose-expansion at the RP2D. Two tumor types to be evaluated in this
      part of the trial will be selected based upon findings from Part 1, additional preclinical
      data, and additional clinical data available at that time from other agents inhibiting these
      targets. Patients will be entered, depending upon their underlying malignancy, to one of two
      corresponding expansion cohorts: Cohort A or Cohort B.
