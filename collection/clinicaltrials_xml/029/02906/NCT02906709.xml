  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy of omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly compared to placebo
      in Japanese patients with T2DM who have inadequate glycemic control on insulin monotherapy
      in addition to diet and exercise therapy. The primary hypothesis of the study is that
      omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly provides greater reduction in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) compared
      with placebo as assessed by change from baseline to Week 16 [Phase A (double-blind period)].

      After a screening period of up to 2 weeks followed by a pretreatment period of 2 or 10
      weeks, each participant will be receiving assigned double-blind treatment (omarigliptin 25
      mg or placebo once weekly) for approximately 16 weeks (Phase A) followed by 36 weeks of
      open-label treatment (omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly, Phase B). After the end of treatment
      each participant will be followed for 21 days.
