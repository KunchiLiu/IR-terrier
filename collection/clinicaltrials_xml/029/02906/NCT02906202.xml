    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-site, single-dose, Phase 3 study in approximately 15 subjects
      ≥12 and ≤50 years of age with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT), also known as
      β-thalassemia major, who do not have a β0 mutation at both alleles of the hemoglobin β (HBB)
      gene. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) using LentiGlobin BB305 Drug Product.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects between 12 and 50 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent or assent
             (as applicable), and able to provide written consent or assent.

          -  Diagnosis of TDT with a history of at least 100 mL/kg/year of packed red blood cells
             (pRBCs) or ≥8 transfusions of pRBCs per year for the prior 2 years.

          -  Clinically stable and eligible to undergo hematopoietic stem cell therapy (HSCT).

          -  Treated and followed for at least the past 2 years in a specialized center that
             maintained detailed medical records, including transfusion history.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a mutation characterized as β0 mutation at both alleles of the HBB gene.

          -  Positive for presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2),
             hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C (HCV).

          -  A white blood cell (WBC) count &lt;3×10^9/L, and/or platelet count &lt;100×10^9/L not
             related to hypersplenism.

          -  Uncorrected bleeding disorder.

          -  Any prior or current malignancy.

          -  Prior HSCT.

          -  Advanced liver disease.

          -  A cardiac T2* &lt;10 ms by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  Any other evidence of severe iron overload that, in the Investigator's opinion,
             warrants exclusion.

          -  Participation in another clinical study with an investigational drug within 30 days
             of Screening.

          -  Any other condition that would render the subject ineligible for HSCT, as determined
             by the attending transplant physician or investigator.

          -  Prior receipt of gene therapy.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding in a postpartum female or absence of adequate
             contraception for fertile subjects.

          -  A known and available HLA-matched family donor.
