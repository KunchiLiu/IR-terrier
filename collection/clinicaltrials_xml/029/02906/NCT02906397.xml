          -  Local or loco-regional therapy (ie surgery, radiation therapy, hepatic arterial
             embolization, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol
             injection or cryoablation) must have been completed ≥4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Must be willing to undergo a pretreatment biopsy

          -  A history of prior radiotherapy is permitted, as long as the prior radiated site is
             not overlapping with the site of planned SBRT

          -  Measurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) version 1.1

          -  An index lesion measuring between 1cm-7cm that is amenable to hypofractionated
             radiation therapy at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             at screening and must use an approved contraceptive method (for example, intrauterine
             device, birth control pills or barrier device) which has an expected failure rate of
             &lt;1%, if appropriate for at least 3 months after the last dose of galunisertib.

          -  Must have adequate organ and hematopoietic function as defined below:

        Laboratory Test Required Value Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥100
        x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥9.0 x 109/L Alanine transaminase ≤2.5 x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase
        ≤2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine or CrCl ≤2.0 x ULN Total Bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any history of a serious medical or psychiatric condition that would prevent the
             patient from signing the informed consent form

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Use of any other chemotherapy, radiotherapy or experimental drug within 4 weeks prior
             to first study treatment date

          -  A history of radiotherapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render SBRT
             unsafe to administer

          -  Those who have not recovered from adverse events ≤ grade 1 secondary to therapy
             administered &gt;4 weeks prior to first study treatment date, with the exception of
             stable grade 2 neuropathy

          -  Subjects may not receive concomitant anticancer agents. Antiviral agents aimed at
             treating infectious hepatitis are permitted

          -  History of or suspected hypersensitivity to radiation or to galunisertib

             moderate or severe heart valve function defect) that is not stable for at least 6
             months.. Note: Left ventricular [LV] ejection fraction &lt;50% is allowed only if
             clinically stable for at least 6 months (evaluation based on the institutional lower
             limit of normal).

             topical skin and/or eye drop-containing corticosteroids) or immunosuppressive therapy
             (excludes low-dose methotrexate). All other systemic corticosteroids above
             physiologic replacement dosing must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to first
             study treatment

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence as documented in the chart that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements

          -  A second primary malignancy that, in the judgment of the investigator, may affect the
             interpretation of results

          -  Prior malignancies. Patients with carcinoma in-situ of any origin and patients with
             prior malignancies who are in remission and whose likelihood of recurrence is very
             low (such as basal cell carcinoma) as judged by the Lilly clinical research physician
             (CRP), are eligible.

          -  Any illness or condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect the

          -  Any other conditions judged by the investigator that would limit the evaluation of
