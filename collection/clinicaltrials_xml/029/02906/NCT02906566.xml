  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been increasing evidence for different rates of natural aging in humans and one of
      the best organs to study human aging is skin. Studies have demonstrated anti-aging effects
      of topical agents (such as creams, gels, lotions, or ointments) and one of them, retinol or
      vitamin A, was shown to decrease fine wrinkling in skin of older individuals. Additionally,
      studies of retinol in humans have largely occurred in white populations and so this study
      aims to focus on skin aging in individuals of East Asian descent as they represent a
      majority of the world population. This study aims to better characterize the molecular basis
      of rejuvenation effects and to potentially discover new topical agents with similar and/or
      more effective preservation of skin youthfulness.
