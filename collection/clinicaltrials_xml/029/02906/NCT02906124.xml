  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), treated at centres in Europe,
      South Africa and Australia, with pregnancy confirmed during the study observation period and
      who provide informed consent to participate in the study.

      Exposed subjects are women who received Repatha® during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding;
      unexposed subjects are women who have not received Repatha® during pregnancy and/or
