      The purpose of this study is to conduct a parallel group, randomized trial of primary care
      clinic-based and community-based programs to educate and support low-income, Hispanic
      patients with chronic pain to adopt evidence-based pain self-care behaviors and activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Significance Over the past two decades, opioid analgesic (OA) drugs have been
      increasingly prescribed for chronic pain despite little to no effectiveness for treatment &gt;6
      months. In prospective cohorts, OA therapy can worsen pain and disability by promoting a
      sedentary lifestyle. Yet some type of intervention is necessary because chronic pain is not
      &quot;curable&quot; in a conventional sense so the patient must learn and maintain a lifestyle to
      increase function, mobility, and cognition despite their pain. The safety threat of OAs
      galvanized the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) develop its National Pain
      Strategy that uses non-pharmacologic approaches to manage pain as the first line management.
      Unfortunately, there are few patient-centered programs to improve function and pain through
      proactive and daily self-care behaviors that are available to low income, minority patients
      who are most likely to receive poor quality pain care.

      For low income, predominantly Hispanic patients with chronic pain, the investigators will
      conduct a trial of non-pharmacologic pain management program delivered in clinic- versus
      community-based settings. The program in both settings will offer similar educational
      content such as: pain physiology and goal setting as well as training in exercises,
      stretching, massage, and mindfulness techniques. This program incorporates elements of
      evidence-based approaches that have been demonstrated to improve outcomes of chronic back
      and lower extremity musculoskeletal pain. However, little is known about how to engage
      persons with chronic pain in self-care management. Therefore, the program tests delivery of
      this intervention in two different settings: individually in clinic or as a group in a
      convenient community-based location.

      Objective:

      For this study, the investigators will randomize primary care patients treated for chronic
      lower extremity or back pain with OAs to a 6-month multimodality non-pharmacologic pain care
      program that will differ by setting, educator, and individual versus group education. In one
      arm, subjects will receive the pain care program individually by health educator in clinic
      and, in the second arm, subjects will be taught in groups by experts in nearby public
      library.

      Study Design:

      The investigators will conduct a parallel group, randomized trial of clinic- and community-
      structured programs to educate and promote pain self-care by low-income, predominantly
      Hispanic patients aged 35-70 who have received at least two months of OA therapy for chronic
      non-cancer back and lower extremity pain. A total of 90 subjects will be randomized to: 1) a
      clinic-based self-care program led by health educator who offers evidence-based pain and
      self-care education onsite, or 2) a community-based program organized by a community health
      worker (CHW) assisted by students in physical therapy but with self-care education and
      training delivered by content experts. A low literacy PowerPoint educational program in
      Spanish or English will be delivered by a trained health educator in clinic 6 monthly
      sessions lasting 30-45 minutes. In the community there will be 9 sessions delivered by 7
      content experts every 2 weeks for the first three months and once a month for the last three
      months, with each session lasting an hour. To increase availability in the community, the
      same group session is offered twice week. Sessions include: 1) Orientation to the pain
      program; 2) Pain physiology exercises/stretching; 3) Stress management and mindfulness; 4)
      Massage therapy approaches; 5) Nutrition; 6) Sleep hygiene; 7) Relapse prevention-exercise;
      8) Health literacy, Internet resources; 9) Review and long-term pain self-care strategies.
      In the community setting, participants are able to practice stretching, exercise,
      self-massage, and mindfulness techniques with experts. For the clinic, sessions are
      condensed to be delivered in 6 meetings.

      All subjects will be given information to work on personally selected goals through home
      activities and receive phone/texting support from a health educator (clinic arm) or CHW
      (community program). Patient progress will be monitored by self-reported logs of activity
      measures as well as measures taken at baseline, 3- and 6- months assessing physical and
      mental function, pain and quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that patients in
      both arms of the study will show improvement in the primary outcome of the 5-x sit-to-stand
      test, which reflects improvement in the critical skill of rising from chairs, cars, and
      toilets and is associated with improvements in gait speed and overall psychosocial function,
      as described below. These are all validated physical and mental function measures (see
      below) In addition, patient adherence to meetings will be collected to compare
      implementation of the two programs. This trial will offer a valuable foundation for
      subsequent studies on the effect of multimodality pain self-care programs in helping
      patients reduce or even avoid reliance on risky OA therapy while achieving desirable
      functional goals.

      Impact: If either or both of these patient-centered self-care programs improve patient
      functional outcomes, they can be sustained and expanded through preexisting partnerships
      with the primary care clinic and library system for future studies targeting reduced
      reliance on OAs as the lynchpin of chronic pain management and improve option of and
      decreased long-term OA use for chronic pain.
