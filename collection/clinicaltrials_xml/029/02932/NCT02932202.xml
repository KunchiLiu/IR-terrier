  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and excessive weight gain in pregnancy have significant associated maternal and
      fetal complications including gestational diabetes, large for gestational age infants, birth
      trauma, and stillbirth. The standard of care places the responsibility on the providers
      during prenatal visits to remind patients of their weight gain goals and provide appropriate
      counseling. The objective of this study is to evaluate a sustainable medical
      student-assisted longitudinal program of nutritional counseling and web based nutrition
      tracking for pregnant women on excessive weight gain during pregnancy and the effects on
      diet choices and fetal and maternal complications.

      Obesity and excessive weight gain in pregnancy have significant associated maternal and
      fetal complications including gestational diabetes, large for gestational age infants, birth
      trauma, and stillbirth. The rates of obesity in American adults is 34.9% and the rates of
      excessive weight gain in pregnancy for all women range from 20-40% with even higher rates
      seen in the obese. Such high rates are putting mothers and infants at significant risk.Â· In
      2009, the Institute of Medicine outlined clear guidelines for suggested weight gain goals
      based on pre-pregnancy BMI. Currently only 30-40% of pregnant women are meeting the
      suggested weight gain goals and the great majority not meeting the goals are gaining
      excessive weight. However, despite the high prevalence of excessive weight gain, there is
      little access to insurance covered nutrition counselling. The standard of care places the
      responsibility on the providers during prenatal visits to remind patients of their weight
      gain goals and provide appropriate counselling. This can be challenging due to limited time
      and resources. However, there is good evidence that diet intervention reduces the risk of
      excessive weight gain by up to 20%. If appropriate nutritional counselling were available to
      all patients, the rates of excessive weight gain could be significantly impacted and have
      widespread improvement in pregnancy outcomes. The CDC has made important progress in
      providing free nutrition resources online to all patients. This study aims to incorporate
      this free resource with a sustainable ongoing nutrition counselling to impact the rates of
      excessive weight gain in pregnancy.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate a sustainable medical student-assisted
      longitudinal program of nutritional counseling and web based nutrition tracking for pregnant
      women on excessive weight gain during pregnancy and the effects on diet choices and fetal
      and maternal complications.

    <description>The intervention group will be contacted every 2 weeks by medical students over the phone to provide nutrition counseling and complete a verbal survey. During the phone calls, participants will be asked a series of questions regarding their dietary intake over the course of the last 2 weeks. If any deficiencies are identified, participants will be counseled on those topics</description>
