      The primary objectives of this study are as follows:

      Part A: To evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)
      and confirm the dose of TAF 25 mg tablet given once daily in treatment-naive and
      treatment-experienced adolescents (aged 12 to &lt; 18 years) with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)

      Part B: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity (HBV DNA &lt; 20 IU/mL) of
      TAF 25 mg once daily versus placebo through Week 24 in treatment-naive and
      treatment-experienced adolescents with CHB.
