  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cluster-randomized crossover trial involving adult ICU patients, family members and ICU
      workers is being conducted. Near 35 intensive care units (ICUs) will be evaluated. In the
      first study period (T1) Brazilian ICUs with RFVMs (&lt;4.5 hours/day) will be randomly assigned
      to either an restrictive family visitation model (RFVM) (intermittent visits according to
      local ICU regulation) or to a flexible family visitation model (FFVM) (12 consecutive hours
      per day) in a 1:1 ratio. After enrollment of 25 patients and 25 family members, there will
      be a 30-day period without subject recruitment (T2) to avoid contamination bias. After this
      period, each ICU will be assigned to an intervention contrary to that which initially
      receive (T3) until the enrollment of more 25 patients and 25 family members. The primary
      outcome is the cumulative incidence of delirium among ICU patients. Secondary outcome
      measures include delirium-free days, mechanical ventilation-free days, any ICU-acquired
      infections, ICU length of stay and all-cause hospital mortality among patients; satisfaction
      and symptoms of anxiety and depression among family members; and prevalence of symptoms of
      burnout syndrome among ICU workers. Tertiary outcomes include need of antipsychotic use,
      need of mechanical restraints, unplanned loss of invasive devices, and ICU acquired
      pneumonia, urinary tract infection and bloodstream infection among ICU patients; perception
      of involvement in patient care among family members of ICU patients; and satisfaction among
      ICU workers.

    <intervention_model_description>The following interventions will be evaluated in the present study: restrictive family visitation model (intermittent visits according to local ICU regulation) and flexible family visitation model (12 consecutive hours per day). The unit of of concealed randomization is the ICU to minimize the risk of contamination, given that we intend to apply the intervention to the whole ICU multidisciplinary team. We will randomize ICUs to either an RFVM or to an FFVM as the initial intervention (T1). After enrollment of 25 ICU patients and 25 family members, there will be a 30-day period without patient or family member recruitment (T2) to avoid contamination bias. After this period, each ICU will be assigned to an intervention contrary to that which initially receive (T3) until the enrollment of more 25 ICU patients and 25 family members.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In the FFVM, two or fewer family members will be allowed to visit the patient for up to 12 consecutive hours each day. In addition to family visitation, patients will be allowed to receive social visits in specific time intervals (according local ICU regulation). To have access to the FFVM, family members of ICU patients will have to attend a structured meeting at ICU in which they will receive orientations about the ICU environment, common ICU treatments, rehabilitation and basic infection control practices, multidisciplinary work at ICU and palliative treatment. Social visitors will not be required to attend the structured meeting.</description>
