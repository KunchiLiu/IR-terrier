      Introduction:

      It is well established that physical fitness improves muscle performance either in sedentary
      people or in athletes. In this regard, specific exercises for respiratory muscles can result
      in better functional performance in hospitalized individuals, especially in critically ill
      patients in prolonged weaning.

      Objectives:

      To compare the following variables between intervention and control patients: success in
      weaning, free time off ventilator on ICU after weaning, and gain of muscle strength with the
      use of the inspiratory muscle training (IMT).

      Patients and methods:

      Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. Only individuals on prolonged weaning will
      be enrolled. They will undergo IMT or will be managed in a conventional manner. The primary
      endpoint will be successful weaning. In addition, other variables such as free time off
      ventilator on ICU after weaning and muscle strength will be measured. In addition, mortality
      in the ICU, inside the hospital and after discharge will be followed for one year after
      study entrance.

      Expected results:

      According to the working hypothesis, it is expected that the performance of patients
      undergoing IMT will be superior to the conventional treatment. Also, their time to mortality
      is expected to be longer.
