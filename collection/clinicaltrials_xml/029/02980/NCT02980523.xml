    <textblock>
      Hypothesis PRO-157 (Project-157) ophthalmic solution is as safe and effective, demonstrating
      non-inferiority, when compared against Moxifloxacin and Gatifloxacin in the treatment of
      conjunctivitis.

      General objective: assess the safety and efficacy of the PRO-157 ophthalmic solution in
      three different dosing regimens, versus Moxifloxacin, versus Gatifloxacin in patients with
      bacterial conjunctivitis.

      Specific objectives:

      determine the safety of the PRO-157 ophthalmic solution in three different dosages versus
      Moxifloxacin versus Gatifloxacin in patients with bacterial conjunctivitis by the incidence
      of adverse events.

      evaluate the efficacy of the PRO-157 ophthalmic solution in three different dosing regimens,
      versus Moxifloxacin, versus Gatifloxacin in patients with bacterial conjunctivitis through
      evaluation of ocular signs and symptoms such as: burning, tearing, foreign body sensation,
      pruritus, photophobia, Conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, secretion, membranes and / or
      pseudomembranes, scales and eyelid edema, epitheliopathy.

      Number of participants: 300 eyes, 60 per group.

      Inclusion criteria: Patients with bacterial conjunctivitis (signs and / or symptoms and / or
      culture)

      Treatment duration:

      Recruitment: 4 months Treatment: 7 days Follow-up: 15 days

      Criteria for evaluation:

      Measurements of effectiveness: Main efficacy criterion

      It will be determined as effective if there is a reduction in number or species of bacterial
      flora by comparing the basal culture against the final culture among the five different
      patient groups.

      Reduction or absence of infection with the clinical evaluation through signs and symptoms
      such as burning, tearing, foreign body sensation, pruritus, photophobia, conjunctival
      hyperemia, chemosis, secretion, eyelid edema, membranes or pseudomembranes, palpebral scales
      and epitheliopathy

      Safety Measurements: it will be determined by visual acuity and adverse events

      This is a phase II multicenter, evaluating 5 treatment arms. Patients recruited diagnosed
      with bacterial conjunctivitis will be treated for 7 days with any of three doses of PRO-157,
      Moxifloxacin, or Gatifloxacin.

      The randomization will be coordinated by a member of the research team previously designated
      by principal investigator (PI) who will not be masked and will instruct the patients about
      how to apply the drops, emphasizing patients not mention to the evaluating physician about
      frequency of the study medication.

      For protocol purpose, the infected eye (s) will be taken into account at the time of
      baseline, however the study medication and procedures will be applied and performed in both
      eyes to protect the healthy eye.

      The study is divided into the following evaluation periods:

      Visit 1 baseline (day 1), visit 2 (day 3), final visit (day 8). and a telephone call (day
      23) for the evaluation of adverse events after 15 days of the last drug application.

      In each visit the PI will take a photograph of both eyes to make a visual clinical
      comparison at the end of the study.

      Subjects will be allocated to any of the following regimen dosages:

        -  PRO-157 1 drop 2 times daily in both eyes

        -  PRO-157 1 drop 3 times daily in both eyes.

        -  PRO-157 1 drop 4 times daily in both eyes.

        -  Moxifloxacin 1 drop 3 times daily in both eyes.

        -  Gatifloxacin 1 drop 3 times daily in both eyes.

      All regimen dosage will have a duration of 7 days. An artificial tear preservative free
      (Lagricel Ofteno®) will also be applied 15 minutes before instillation of study drug, during
      study period.

      Data Analysis

      The data will be analyzed by Intention to Treat (ITT) and per Protocol (PP) , in which each
      of the variables is described, the ITT population will be constituted by all subjects
      recruited who have received at least one dose of the study, the PP population will be the
      subset of ITT composed of all subjects without any major deviation from the protocol and the
      bivariate analysis will be performed in this group.

      Continuous quantitative variables are expressed and presented by measures of central
      tendency and dispersion (mean, standard deviation and ranges). Qualitative nominal and
      ordinal variables are presented by means of frequencies and proportions.

      The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to know the normal distribution or not of the
      results obtained in each study group.

      The differences between-group were determined by the ANOVA test, for the quantitative
      variables.

      For the qualitative variables, Pearson's chi-square will be used. Intra-group differences
      were analyzed using the T-test in the case of quantitative variables.

      For the qualitative variables differences were calculated by Pearson's chi-square.

      The level of significance was an alpha of 0.05 or less.
