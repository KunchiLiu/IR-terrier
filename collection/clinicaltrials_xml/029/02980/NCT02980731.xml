  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, single-arm study is to evaluate the impact of venetoclax on
      the quality of life of participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; a type of cancer
      affecting the blood and the bone marrow) including those with the 17p deletion or TP53
      mutation (local lab assessed) OR in CLL participants who have received prior B-Cell Receptor
      Inhibitor (BCRi) therapy. The starting dose of venetoclax is 20 mg once daily. The dose must
      be gradually increased over a period of 5 weeks up to the daily dose of 400 mg. Participants
      may continue receiving venetoclax for up to 2 years. After the treatment period,
      participants may continue on into a 2-year follow-up period.

    <measure>Change in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) subscale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening (Baseline) up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including a global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) scale. Participants rate items on a four-point scale, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 as &quot;very much.&quot; A change of 5 - 10 points is considered a small. A change of 10 - 20 points is considered a moderate change.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Module (EORTC QLQ-CLL16),</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening (Baseline; Day 0) up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-CLL16 is comprised of 16 questions that address 5 domains of HRQoL important in CLL. Participants rate items on a 4-point scale, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 as &quot;very much.&quot; A negative change in score from baseline represents an improvement in symptoms. A change of 5 - 10 points is considered a small change. A change of 10 - 20 points is considered a moderate change.</description>

    <measure>EuroQoL 5 Dimension 5 Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening (Baseline; Day 0) up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L has five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. These dimensions are measured on a 5-level scale: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The scores for the 5 dimensions are used to compute a single utility index score ranging from zero (0.0) to 1 (1.0) representing the general health status of the individual. The EQ-5D-5L also contains a visual analog scale (VAS) to assess the subject's overall health.</description>

    <measure>Change in the remaining subscales/items from the EORTC QLQ-C30.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening (Baseline; Day 0) up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and difficulties). Subjects rate items on a four-point scale, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 as &quot;very much.&quot; A change of 5 - 10 points is considered a small change. A change of 10 - 20 points is considered a moderate change.</description>

    <measure>Complete Remission rate (complete remission [CR] + complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery [CRi])</measure>
    <time_frame>When all participants have completed Week 48 disease assessment, or after all enrolled participants have discontinued venetoclax, whichever is earlier.</time_frame>
    <description>Complete remission rate (CR + CRi) defined as the proportion of subjects achieving a CR or CRi as their best response (per the investigator assessment) based on IWCLL NCI -WG criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured up to 2 years after the last participant has enrolled in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR assessed as the proportion of participants with an overall response (CR + CRi + Nodular Partial Remission [nPR] + Partial Remission [PR]) based on the 2008 Modified International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia National Cancer Institute-Working Group Guidelines (IWCLL NCI-WG) criteria.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Overall Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured up to 2 years after the last participant has enrolled in the study.</time_frame>
    <description>DoR is defined as the number of days from the date of first response (CR, CRi, nPR, or PR) to the earliest recurrence or progressive disease.</description>
