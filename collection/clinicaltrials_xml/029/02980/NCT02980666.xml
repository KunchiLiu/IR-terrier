      The purpose of this study is to determine if an investigational treatment (teduglutide) is
      safe and effective in Japanese children (age 1 through 15 years of age) with SBS who are
      dependent on parenteral support. This study will also evaluate how teduglutide moves through
      the body (pharmacokinetics) and how it affects the body (pharmacodynamics).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed consent by a parent or legally-authorized representative prior to any
             study-related procedures

          2. When applicable, informed assent (as deemed appropriate by the Institutional Review
             Board) by the subject prior to any study-related procedures

          3. Male or female child or adolescent aged 1 year through 15 years

          4. Current history of SBS as a result of major intestinal resection (eg, due to
             necrotizing enterocolitis, midgut volvulus, intestinal atresia, or gastroschisis)

          5. Short bowel syndrome that requires PN/IV support that provides at least 30% of
             caloric and/or fluid/electrolyte needs

          6. Stable PN/IV support, defined as inability to significantly reduce PN/IV support,
             usually associated with minimal or no advance in enteral feeds (ie, 10% or less
             change in PN or advance in feeds) for at least 3 months prior to and during
             screening, as assessed by the investigator. Transient instability for events such as
             interruption of central access or treatment of sepsis is allowed if the PN/IV support
             returns to within 10% of baseline prior to the event.

          7. Sexually active female subjects of childbearing potential must use medically
             acceptable methods of birth control during and for 4 weeks following the last dose of
             investigational product

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are not expected to be able to advance oral or tube feeding regimens

          2. Serial transverse enteroplasty or any other bowel lengthening procedure performed
             within 3 months of screening

          3. Known clinically significant untreated intestinal obstruction contributing to feeding
             intolerance and inability to reduce parenteral support

          4. Unstable absorption due to cystic fibrosis or other known DNA abnormalities (eg,
             Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, Fanconi-Bickel syndrome)

          5. Severe, known dysmotility syndrome such as pseudo-obstruction or persistent, severe,
             active gastroschisis-related dysmotility; that is the primary contributing factor to
             feeding intolerance and inability to reduce parenteral support, prior to screening.
             Dysmotility is defined as severe if it is expected to limit the advancement of
             enteral feeding.

          6. Evidence of clinically significant obstruction on upper gastrointestinal (GI) series
             done within 6 months prior to screening

          7. Major GI surgical intervention including significant intestinal resection within 3
             months prior to screening (insertion of feeding tube, anastomotic ulcer repair, minor
             intestinal resections ≤ 10 cm, or endoscopic procedure is allowed)

          8. Unstable cardiac disease or congenital heart disease or cyanotic disease, with the
             exception of subjects who had undergone ventricular or atrial septal defect repair,
             and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation

          9. History of cancer or clinically significant lymphoproliferative disease, not
             including resected cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinoma, or in situ
             non-aggressive and surgically resected cancer

         10. Pregnant or lactating female subjects

         11. Participation in a clinical study using an experimental drug (other than glutamine or
             Omegaven) within 3 months or 5.5 half-lives of the experimental drug, whichever is
             longer, prior to screening and for the duration of the study

         12. Previous use of teduglutide or native/synthetic glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2)

         13. Previous use of glucagon-like peptide-1 analog or human growth hormone within 3
             months prior to screening

         14. Previous use of octreotide or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors within 3
             months prior to screening

         15. Subjects with active Crohn's disease who had been treated with biological therapy
             (eg, antitumor necrosis factor [anti-TNF]) within the 6 months prior to the screening
             visit

         16. Subjects with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who require chronic systemic
             immunosuppressant therapy that had been introduced or changed during the 3 months
             prior to screening

         17. More than 3 SBS-related or PN-related hospital admissions (eg, documented
             infection-related catheter sepsis, clots, bowel obstruction, severe water-electrolyte
             disturbances) within 3 months prior to the screening visit

         18. Any major unscheduled hospital admission which affects parenteral support
             requirements within 1 month prior to or during screening, excluding uncomplicated
             treatment of bacteremia, central line replacement/repair, or issues of similar
             magnitude in an otherwise stable subject

         19. Body weight &lt;10 kg at screening and baseline visits

         20. Signs of active, severe, or unstable clinically significant hepatic impairment during
             the screening period, indicative by any of the following laboratory test results:

               1. Total bilirubin ≥2x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥7x ULN

               3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥7x ULN

               4. Indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin ≥2x ULN

         21. Signs of known continuous active or unstable, clinically significant renal
             dysfunction shown by results of an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below
             50 mL/min/1.73 m2

         22. Parent(s)/legally-authorized representative(s) and/or subjects who are not capable of
             understanding or not willing to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements

         23. Unstable, clinically significant, active, untreated pancreatic or biliary disease

         24. Any condition, disease, illness, or circumstance that in the investigator's opinion
             puts the subject at any undue risk, prevents completion of the study, or interferes
             with analysis of the study results.
