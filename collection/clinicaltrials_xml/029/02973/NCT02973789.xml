    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized controlled phase III trial aimed to test the efficacy
      and safety of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) in combination with PD-1 inhibitors or
      docetaxel, for second line treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) .The device is an
      experimental, portable, battery operated device for chronic administration of alternating
      electric fields (termed TTFields or TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor, by means of
      surface, insulated electrode arrays.

      PAST PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:

      The effect of the electric fields (TTFields, TTF) has demonstrated significant activity in
      in vitro and in vivo NSCLC pre-clinical models both as a single modality treatment and in
      combination with chemotherapies and PD-1 inhibitors. TTFields have been demonstrated to act
      synergistically with taxanes and have been shown to be additive when combined with PD-1
      inhibitors. In addition, TTFields have shown to inhibit metastatic spread of malignant
      melanoma in in vivo experiment.

      In a pilot study, 42 patients with advanced NSCLC who had had tumor progression after at
      least one line of prior chemotherapy, received pemetrexed together with TTFields (150 kHz)
      applied to the chest and upper abdomen until disease progression (Pless M., et al., Lung
      Cancer 2011). The combination was well tolerated and the only device-related adverse event
      was mild to moderate contact dermatitis. Efficacy endpoints were remarkably high compared to
      historical data for pemetrexed alone.

      In addition, a phase III trial of Optune® (200 kHz) as monotherapy compared to active
      chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients showed TTFields to be equivalent to active
      chemotherapy in extending survival, associated with minimal toxicity, good quality of life,
      and activity within the brain (14% response rate) (Stupp R., et al., EJC 2012). Finally, a
      phase III trial of Optune® combined with maintenance temozolomide compared to maintenance
      temozolomide alone has shown that combined therapy led to a significant improvement in both
      progression free survival and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      without the addition of high grade toxicity and without decline in quality of life (Stupp
      R., et al., JAMA 2015).

      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:

      All patients included in this trial are patients with squamous or non-squamous,
      unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had disease progression while on or
      after front-line treatment. In addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

      Patients receive docetaxel or PD-1 inhibitor in combination with TTFields using the
      NovoTTF-100L System.

      Patients receive docetaxel or PD-1 inhibitor without TTFields. Patients will be randomized
      at a 1:1 ratio. Baseline tests will be performed in patients enrolled in both arms. If
      assigned to the NovoTTF-100L group, the patients will be treated continuously with the
      device until irPD in the thorax/liver (lung cancer progression based on Imune Related
      Response Criteria (irRC)).

      On both arms, patients who have irPD will switch to a third line treatment according to
      local practice.

      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:

      Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces
      on metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of
      electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic
      particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.

      Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues.
      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their
      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (150
      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects
      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the
      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.

      The breakthrough finding made by Novocure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very
      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in
      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are
      multiplying, TTFields cause electrically-charged cellular components of these cells to
      change their location within the dividing cell, disrupting their normal function and
      ultimately leading to cell death. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building
      blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place.
      TTFields interfere with the normal orientation of these tiny motors related to other
      cellular components since they are electrically-charged as well. As a result of these two
      effects, tumor cell division is slowed, results in cellular death or reverses after
      continuous exposure to TTFields.

      Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells
      since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to
      a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach. Finally, the
      frequency of TTFields applied to each type of cancer is specific and may not damage normally
      dividing cells in healthy tissues.

      In conclusion, TTFields hold the promise of serving as a brand new treatment for NSCLC with
      very few side effects.
