        General Eligibility

        All patients must meet at least one of the following definitions of failed standard
        therapy of decompensated heart failure:

        Definition for failure of standard therapy:

          1. Decompensated heart failure refractory to standard therapy (Milrinone of
             ≥0.5mcg/kg/min for &gt;48 hours with EF &lt;35%) including any of the following:

               -  (SaO2 - SmVO2) &gt; 30 % or lactate &gt;3 AND/OR

               -  Need for second inotropic agent AND/OR

               -  Need for positive pressure ventilation AND

               -  Patient not qualifying for long term ventricular assist device support or
                  transplant at the time of assessment.

          2. Cardiogenic shock with acute decompensated heart failure (requiring positive pressure
             ventilation and addition of inotropic support with or without use of Milrinone with
             EF &lt;35%) refractory to therapy for more than 48h including any or all of the
             following:

               -  (SaO2 - SmVO2) &gt; 30 % or lactate &gt;3

               -  Patient not qualifying for long term ventricular assist device support or
                  transplant at the time of assessment.

               -  Potential need for short-term mechanical circulatory support.

          3. Failure to wean off ECMO support with use of standard inotropic / vasoconstrictor
             support.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, ≤18 years of age with acute or acute on chronic decompensated heart
             failure.

          2. Male or female, ≤18 years of age on ECMO support and unable to wean from ECMO
             support.

          3. Informed Consent signed by the subject's parents or their legally acceptable
             representatives indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures
             required for expanded access and are willing to participate in the study.

          4. Patients meeting one of the following definitions of failed standard therapy of
             decompensated heart failure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients &lt; 36 weeks gestational age

          2. Patients weighing &lt; 2 kg

          3. Obstructive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, pericardial tamponade

          4. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGRF) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2.

          5. Known allergic reaction or sensitivity to levosimendan or excipients.

          6. A history of Torsades de Pointes, uncorrectable hypo- or hyperkalemia, uncorrectable
             hypo- or hypercalcemia

          7. Pregnant, suspected to be pregnant, or breast-feeding.

          8. Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to give
             written informed consent.
