  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 15 years, cesarean delivery is most commonly performed under spinal anesthesia
      using hyperbaric bupivacaine which provides an adequate sensory and motor block. Despite
      effective surgical anesthesia, bupivacaine is associated with long duration motor block and
      dose-dependent maternal hypotension potentially harmful for the fetus. Prilocaine with its
      new 2% hyperbaric formulation (HP), developed recently, showed rapid onset of action and
      faster regression of motor block compared to other local anesthetics without noteworthy
      side-effects when used intrathecally. The aim of this randomized, multicenter, powered
      clinical trial is to investigate whether HP may be an efficient alternative to hyperbaric
      bupivacaine for scheduled caesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia.
