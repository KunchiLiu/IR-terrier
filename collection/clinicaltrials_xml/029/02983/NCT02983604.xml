    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the Phase 1b Dose Escalation part of this study are to
      characterize the safety and tolerability of GS-5829 in combination with exemestane or
      fulvestrant in women with advanced estrogen receptor positive Her2-negative (ER+/HER2-)
      breast cancer and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (if not already determined)
      or the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of this study.

      The primary objectives of the Randomized Phase 2 Dose Expansion portion of this study are to
      evaluate the efficacy of GS-5829 in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant compared to
      exemestane or fulvestrant alone in women with advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
