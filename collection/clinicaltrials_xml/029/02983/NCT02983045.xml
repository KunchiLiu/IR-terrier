  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine first, the recommended Phase 2 dose of NKTR-214 when administered
      in combination with nivolumab, and then, the clinical benefit, safety, and tolerability of
      combining NKTR-214 with nivolumab in select patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma or
      non-small cell lung cancer. Both drugs target the immune system and may act synergistically
      to promote anti-cancer effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NKTR-214 is a cytokine (investigational agent) that is designed to target CD122, a protein
      which is found on certain immune cells (known as CD8+ T Cells and Natural Killer Cells) to
      expand these cells to promote their anti-tumor effects. Nivolumab is a full human monoclonal
      antibody that binds to a molecule called PD-1 on immune cells and promotes anti-tumor
      effects.

      Approximately 40 eligible patients that enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study
      (Phase 1) will be assigned to one of five dose regimens of NKTR-214 in combination with
      nivolumab (0.006 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 21 days with 240 mg nivolumab every 14 days, 0.003
      mg/kg NKTR-214 every 14 days with 240 mg nivolumab every 14 days, 0.006 mg/kg NKTR-214 every
      14 days with 240 mg nivolumab every 14 days, 0.006 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 21 days with 360 mg
      nivolumab every 21 days, 0.003 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 21 days with 360 mg nivolumab every 21
      days). Based on safety, tolerability and efficacy observed in the trial, enrollment to
      additional dose escalation cohorts are planned. The first phase of the study will test the
      safety and efficacy profile of the combination and determine which dose will be studied in
      Phase 2 of the overall study. During Phase 2, cohorts of patients with specific cancers will
      be expanded and these patients will receive the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of
      NKTR-214 in combination with nivolumab.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur. The efficacy of
      the combination will be assessed using objective response rate (ORR). Exploratory
      immunological biomarkers in plasma and tumor samples will evaluate immune activation.

    <description>NKTR-214 in escalating doses, will be combined with one of the two proposed doses of nivolumab. The goal of this dose escalation part of the study is to find the recommended phase 2 dose.
For the second part of the study, enrollment into a dose expansion cohort will commence once the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) is established for this combination.
Patients may be discontinued from receiving study treatment based on the results of disease assessments or if experiencing intolerable side effects.</description>
