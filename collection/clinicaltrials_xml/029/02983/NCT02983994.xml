      The aim of the study is to evaluate the errors that may occur during inhalation of two
      devices in patients with asthma, as well as to study whether it relates to the degree of
      control of patient symptoms and the degree of compliance of medication symptoms. Finally, we
      also want to study the degree of patient satisfaction with each of the inhalers studied
