      Study Drug Administration:

      Every study cycle will be 28 days.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will begin
      study treatment within 28 days after the screening tests are performed. Participant will
      receive AZD9150 by vein over 1 hour 3 times before the first dose of MEDI4736 (7, 5, and 3
      days beforehand), and then on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of every cycle.

      Participant will receive MEDI4736 by vein over about 1 hour on Day 1 of every cycle, about
      30 minutes after the AZD9150 infusion.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may continue receiving the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks is in
      participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to receive the study drugs
      if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to
      follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check participant's thyroid function.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected
           for a pregnancy test.

      On Days 8 and 22 of Cycles 1 and beyond:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests (Cycle 1 only).

      On Day 15 of Cycles 1 and beyond:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests (Cycle 1 only).

      Every 2 months, participant will have a PET/CT scan or MRI to check the status of the
      disease.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 30 days after participant's last dose of the study drugs:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check participant's thyroid function.

        -  Participant will have a PET/CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.

      Follow-Up:

      About 1-3 months after participant's last dose of the study drugs, participant will have a
      PET/CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      If participant cannot come to MD Anderson for participant's follow-up visits, participant
      may be called every 12 weeks and asked about how participant is doing. These calls will last
      about 10 minutes each.

      Participation on the study will be over at the end of the follow-up period.

      Treatment Beyond Progression:

      If the disease appears to be getting worse or the tumors appear to be getting larger,
      participant may still be able to receive the study drugs if participant and participant's
      doctor decide it is in participant's best interest. The study doctor will discuss this
      option with participant. If participant chooses to receive the study drugs after the disease
      gets worse, participant will sign an additional informed consent form.

      This is an investigational study. AZD9150 and MEDI4736 are not FDA approved or commercially
      available. They are currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can
      explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 75 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical
             cause). Two methods of contraception which are considered accurate per protocol must
             be combined. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are
             not acceptable methods of birth control.

          8. Women of childbearing potential also may not be breast feeding and must have a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of study
             treatment.

          9. The patient/legal representative must be willing to provide written consent for
             collection of formalin fixed paraffin-embedded blocks or slides from archival

             invasive cancer other than SCCHN in the past 3 years. Exceptions are: Previously
             treated in-situ carcinoma (ie, noninvasive) - Cervical carcinoma stage 1B or less,
             Noninvasive basal cell and squamous cell skin carcinoma - Radically treated prostate
             cancer (prostatectomy or radiotherapy) with normal prostate-specific antigen, and not
             requiring ongoing antiandrogen hormonal therapy

          3. Patients must have completed previous cancer-related treatments before enrollment.
             Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic, or hormonal
             therapy for cancer excludes the patient (concurrent use of hormones for
             noncancer-related conditions [eg, insulin for diabetes or hormone replacement
             therapy] is acceptable). The following intervals between end of the prior treatment
             and first dose of study drug must be observed: -Port-a-cath placement: no waiting
             required. -Minor surgical procedures: &gt;/=7 postoperative days. -Major surgery: &gt;/=4
             weeks. -Radiotherapy: &gt;/=4 weeks. -Chemotherapy: &gt;/=4 weeks. -Immunotherapy or
             investigational anticancer therapy with agents other than mAbs: &gt;/=4 weeks.
             -Immunotherapy or investigational anticancer therapy with mAbs: &gt;/=6 weeks.
             -Immunosuppressive medication: &gt;/=4 weeks with the exceptions of intranasal or
             inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to
             exceed 10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent.

          4. Is still experiencing toxicity related to prior treatment and assessed as CTCAE grade
             &gt;1. Exceptions are alopecia and/or anorexia. The eligibility of patients who are
             still experiencing irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be
             exacerbated by the study drugs in this study (eg, hearing loss) must be reviewed and
             approved by both the Principal Investigator and Medical Monitor.

          5. Has experienced immune-related AEs (irAEs) while receiving prior immunotherapy
             (including anti-CTLA4 treatment) and assessed as CTCAE grade &gt;/= 3

          6. Has active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years with the
             exceptions of vitiligo, Grave's disease, and/or psoriasis not requiring systemic
             treatment

          7. Has active or prior documented inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease,
             ulcerative colitis)

          8. Has a history of primary immunodeficiency

          9. Has undergone an organ transplant that requires use of immunosuppressive treatment

         10. Has a history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis from any cause

         11. Has a history of allergic reactions attributed to the study treatments (AZD9150 or
             MEDI4736), their compounds, or agents of similar chemical or biologic composition
             (eg, antibody therapeutics)

         12. Suffers from a comorbidity that in the opinion of the Investigator renders the
             patient unsuitable for participation in the study. Such comorbidity may include, but
             is not limited to, uncontrolled intercurrent illness such as active infection, severe
             active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, myocardial infarction within 6 months
             before entry, congestive heart failure, symptomatic congestive heart failure, active
             cardiomyopathy, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled
             hypertension, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
             with study requirements.

         13. As judged by the Investigator, has any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             diseases such as active bleeding diatheses, is positive for human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV), or has active hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV)

         14. Has a known history of tuberculosis

         15. Has a condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the
             evaluation of the study drugs or the interpretation of patient safety or study
             results

         16. Has received a live attenuated vaccine within 28 days before the first dose of study
             drug

         17. Judgment by the Investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and
             requirements

         18. Patients with clinically active brain metastases (known or suspected) are excluded
             unless the brain metastases have been previously treated and are considered stable.
             Stable brain metastases are defined as no change on CT scan or magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) scan for a minimum of 2 months AND no change in steroid dose for a
             minimum of 4 weeks, unless change due to intercurrent infection or other acute event.

         19. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control.
