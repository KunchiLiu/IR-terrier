  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      80 patients eligible for a total hip replacement (THR) mainly due to primary osteoarthritis
      were recruited from our waiting list. The patients were randomized to either CFP or Corail
      stem, both groups received Delta cup from Lima. Randomisation was done using envelopes.
      Patients could only participate with one hip. We are evaluating patients with different
      questionnaires, radiographs and RSA analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of femoral neck preserving hip replacement is intended for the young and active
      patients. By preserving proximal bone load, the transmission to the proximal femur is
      supposed to improve and future revision surgery would be facilitated. We speculated that a
      more conservative resection of the femoral neck could lead to better clinical outcomes
      compared to a conventional stem. We therefore decided to compare the clinical outcomes and
      the fixation between a short stem and a stem with a classic, conventional design. 83
      patients were included in our randomized controlled trial where patients either received a
      Collum Femoris Preserving (CFP) stem or a Corail hip stem. Clinical outcomes are being
      assessed, plain radiographs are studied and the early migration is being measured using
      radiostereometric analysis. All of the patients have gone through 1 year follow-up. We are
      waiting for the 2 years data to conduct the final analysis and present the results.

    <measure>Oxford Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Hip Score (OHS) is a short 12-item patient-reported PRO specifically designed and developed to assess function and pain with patients undergoing hip replacement surgery. It is short, reproducible, valid and sensitive to clinically important changes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiostereometric analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Radiostereometric analysis is an accurate method of determining the migration and wear of orthopaedic implants such as total hip arthroplasties. The overall concept of RSA is straightforward: determining the precise location of two distinct objects relative to each other in three dimension (such as the relative position of the femoral component and the proximal femur).</description>
