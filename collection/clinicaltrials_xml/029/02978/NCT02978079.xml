  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Horner's syndrome (HS) is a result of interruption of the sympathetic innervation to the eye
      and ocular adnexa, which can occur due to carotid artery dissection (CAD), along which the
      sympathetic nerve fibers travel to reach the eye. Dissection of the carotid artery is one of
      the etiologies for ischemic stroke in young patients.

      In our current study, we will explore the diagnostic accuracy of automated binocular
      pupillometry in the diagnosis or HS, and its potential in identifying dissection of the
      carotid artery in patients of young age who suffer ischemic stroke.
