  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether curcumin, a drug and naturally-occurring
      plant compound, is safe and effective in the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis
      (PSC).

    <measure>Mean Change in Mayo PSC Risk Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mayo Risk Score (R) = (0.0295 * (age in years)) + (0.5373 * natural logarithm(total bilirubin in mg/dL)) - (0.8389 * (serum albumin in g/dL)) + (0.5380 * natural logarithm(AST in IU/L) + (1.2426 * (points for variceal bleeding)) where:
AST = serum aspartate aminotransferase level, Points for variceal bleeding: 0 if none, 1 if present. Each unit increase in the Mayo Risk Score (R) is associated with a 2.5-fold increase in the risk of death. Most references to the score round the coefficients to 2 decimal places. The score shows very slight upward slope over time in stable patients, but during the terminal phase it shows an acceleration in progression.</description>

             hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, non-alcoholic
             steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or secondary sclerosing cholangitis
