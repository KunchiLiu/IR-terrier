  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a blinded, randomized, parallel groups Phase II trial. Patients with platinum
      sensitive ovarian cancer (defined as time to progression &gt; 6 months in the penultimate
      platinum containing regimen) and who had either a tumor response or a stable disease upon
      completing their last platinum containing regimen will be randomized to either vaccine
      regimen with GM-CSF adjuvant or GM-CSF adjuvant alone as a control group. Treatment will be
      administered as a consolidation therapy within 12 weeks of the last administration of
      platinum.

      The vaccination phase will include 6 administrations of the study drug at 4-week intervals.
      Unless they progress or go off-study, patients will be monitored for tumor response and for
      relapse or progression every 12 weeks after enrollment. Once a patient is off-study, they
      will be followed by quarterly contact until study completion for survival and cancer status.

      The total duration of the patient's participation in the study will be 2 years. Assessment
      for tumor response, disease progression and recurrence will be conducted every 12 weeks from
      the end of treatment until documented disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter double-blind controlled randomized Phase II study to evaluate the
      activity of folate receptor alpha (FRα) peptide vaccine as a consolidation treatment
      following completion of no less than 4 cycles of a platinum containing regimen in patients
      with recurrent platinum sensitive, non-mucinous ovarian, fallopian tube or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

      Patients enrolled will have received two or more previous platinum-containing regimen.
      Patients must be determined as platinum sensitive after completion of their penultimate
      platinum therapy prior to enrollment on this study. Platinum sensitivity is determined as &gt;6
      months and &lt;24 months after completion of the patient's final platinum dose. In addition the
      patients will have demonstrated a tumor response or stable disease upon their last
      platinum-containing regimen (per RECIST v1.1 and/or CA125 GCIG criteria) prior to enrolment
      in this study.

      Following consent the patient eligibility will be confirmed. Patients will need to start
      treatment with study drug within 12 weeks of the last dose of a chemotherapeutic agent of
      the platinum-containing regimen.

      Following randomization, patients will be administered TPIV200 with GM-CSF adjuvant or
      GM-CSF control alone. Patients will have tumor assessments done every 12 weeks ± 1 week for
      up to 2 years, until objective disease progression or the patient withdraws consent.
