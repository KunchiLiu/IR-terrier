  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to further understand the memory response to HPV
      vaccination in subjects who have received 2 versus 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine.
      Although memory responses can be detected shortly after immunization, the best approach to
      measure the long-lasting anamnestic response is to challenge with a booster dose years (&gt; 5)
      after the original exposure.

      This is a single center, interventional study to evaluate long term memory response to Q-HPV
      vaccination and to natural infection. Memory response will be assessed by measuring
      seroprotection 8-10 years post Q-HPV vaccination and to challenge with a booster dose years
      after the original exposure to measure the long-lasting anamnestic response.

                  when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle

          -  Receipt of blood or blood product within 3 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Immune compromise resulting from disease or immunosuppressive systemic medication use
             within 3 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Inadequate participant fluency in English to provide fully informed consent.
