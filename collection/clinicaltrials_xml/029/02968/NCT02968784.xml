  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to show that ExAblate™ MRgFUS is a safe procedure that can
      significantly postpone or eliminate the need of patients with organ confined intermediate
      risk prostate cancer to undergo a definitive treatment (i.e., Radical Prostatectomy or
      Radiation therapy) for their disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the proportion of patients with organ-confined intermediate risk
      prostate cancer (OC-IRPC) undergoing focal ExAblate™ MRgFUS prostate treatment that will be
      free of clinically significant PCa which requires definitive treatment at 2 years after
      completion of their ExAblate™ treatment and to demonstrate the safety of focal ExAblate™
      MRgFUS treatment.

      Clinically significant PCa requiring definitive treatment is defined as pathology findings
      from whole-gland, imaging-guided, extended mapping biopsy of Gleason Score (GS) &gt; 7

      The primary efficacy endpoint in this trial, measured at 24 months with whole-gland extended
      imaging-guided mapping biopsy, is Response scored dichotomously for each subject as follows:

        -  Response = 0 (&quot;Failure&quot;): Positive mapping biopsy defined as Gleason Score &gt; 7
           (indicating definitive treatment) in any part of their prostate gland

        -  Response = 1 (&quot;Success&quot;): Negative mapping biopsy defined as Gleason Score &lt; 7.

      Safety of ExAblate™ treatment will be determined by evaluation of the incidence and severity
      of device related complications from the first treatment day visit throughout entire
      follow-up duration.

      All adverse events will be captured and recorded. However, the safety of the ExAblate™
      treatment will be defined by the incidence and severity of treatment or device related
      adverse events, grades III - V (CTCAE version 4.03; 2010-06-14).

      Secondary Effectiveness Outcomes:

        1. % of patients with negative 5-month follow-up biopsy results in the treated part of the
           prostate

        2. Treatment effect on patients' Quality of Life (QoL), the following validated
           self-reported urogenital functioning assessment instruments will be used before and
           following treatment at pre-specified intervals.

             1. Urinary symptoms - IPSS

             2. Urinary continence - ICIQ-UI-SF

             3. Sexual function - IIEF-15

        3. PSA levels and post-treatment PSA kinetics will also be assessed

    <description>Up to 50% of the prostate gland will be treated. Treatment will include the Index lesion which is visible on MRI + tumor free margins of 3-mm; tumor free margins will not extend beyond the posterior aspect of the prostate capsule.
Urethral and bilateral neurovascular bundle preservation will be preferred whenever clinically justified.
Additional foci in the same hemisphere that are confirmed by biopsy and are &lt; Gleason Score 7 (up to 3+4 or 4+3; no Gleason 5 pattern) or suspected to be positive for malignancy based on multi parametric-MRI) will also be included in the treated volume, providing total treatment volume does not exceed 50% of the gland.</description>
