      A Phase 1, Randomized, Open-Label, 3-Way Crossover, Pilot, Pharmacokinetic Study to Evaluate
      the Steady State Pharmacokinetics of a Once-Weekly Application of Corplex Donepezil
      Transdermal Delivery System (TDS) Compared to Daily Oral Administration of Aricept in
      Healthy Adult Subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 male and female subjects will be enrolled Subjects will receive 2 versions of once-weekly
      Corplex Donepezil TDS and QD oral Aricept; each administered for 35 days in 3 different
      treatment periods.

      For each treatment period; Subjects will receive a lead-in dose of approximately 5 mg
      donepezil/day for 7 days before commencing a dose of 10 mg donepezil/day for 28 days. Blood
      samples for donepezil PK and red blood cell (RBC) AChEI (as a potential pharmacodynamic [PD]
      marker) will be collected pre-dose through Week 8.

      Adhesion and skin irritation will be monitored throughout TDS Treatments. A washout period
      of at least 21 days between the last study drug administration (oral administration or
      removal of TDS, as appropriate) in each treatment period and the first application of TDS or
      oral drug administration, as appropriate, in the following treatment period.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by adverse event reporting, repeated clinical
      and laboratory evaluations

    <description>To evaluate the safety and tolerability (including local skin irritation) of once-weekly Corplex Donepezil TDS. Skin irritation assessed using 8 pt categorical scale based on former FDA.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/990236GD.pdf. The Skin Irritation scale is: no irritation; minimal erythema/barely perceptible; definite erythema readily visible, minimal edema or minimal papular response; erythema and papules; definite edema; erythema, edema and papules; vesicular eruption; strong reaction spreading beyond application site.</description>

    <time_frame>Twice daily during 36-day confinement period</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the adhesion of once-weekly Corplex Donepezil TDS. Adhesion is based on the adhered area (%) of the patch according to FDA.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory Information/Guidances/UCM504157.pdf. Specifically: ≥ 90% adhered (essentially no lift off skin); ≥ 75% to &lt;90% adhered (some edges only lifting off skin); ≥ 50% to &lt;75% adhered (less than half the TDS lifting off skin); &lt; 50% adhered but did not detach (not detached, but more than half of the TDS lifting off skin without falling off); patch completely detached (TDS detached, completely off skin).</description>
