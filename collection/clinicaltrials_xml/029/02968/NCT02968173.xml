      This is a Phase 3b, prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-controlled study to assess the
      safety and effectiveness of immunoprophylaxis with the intramuscular (IM) administration of
      the liquid formulation of palivizumab for the prevention of RSV hospitalizations in infants
      at high risk (infants born at less than or equal to 35 weeks gestational age and less than
      or equal to 6 months of age at enrollment; or infants less than or equal to 24 months of age
      with a diagnosis of chronic lung disease [CLD] of prematurity requiring on-going medical
      treatment within the previous 6 months or infants less than or equal to 24 months of age
      with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease [CHD]).

      Participants will receive palivizumab solution for injection at 15 mg/kg by IM injection
      every 30 days for a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 injections given during anticipated
      periods of RSV risk in the community; the number of doses will depend on the time of
      enrollment during the RSV season.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Infants at high risk of severe RSV infection defined as fulfilling at least one of the
        following:

          -  Infants born ≤ 35 weeks gestational age AND are ≤ 6 months of age at enrollment;

          -  Infants ≤ 24 months of age at enrollment AND with a diagnosis of bronchopulmonary
             dysplasia(BPD) (defined as oxygen requirement at a corrected gestational age of 36
             weeks) requiring intervention/management (i.e., oxygen, diuretics, bronchodilators,
             corticosteroids, etc.) anytime within 6 months prior to enrollment;

          -  Infants ≤ 24 months of age at enrollment with hemodynamically significant congenital
             heart disease (CHD), either cyanotic or acyanotic, unoperated or partially corrected.
             Children with acyanotic cardiac lesions must have pulmonary hypertension (≥ 40 mmHg
             measured pressure in the pulmonary artery [ultrasound acceptable]) or the need for
             daily medication to manage CHD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalization at the time of enrollment (unless discharge is anticipated within 14
             days).

          -  Mechanical ventilation (including continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP) at the
             time of enrollment.

          -  Life expectancy less than 6 months.

          -  Unstable cardiac or respiratory status, including cardiac defects so severe that
             survival is not expected or for which cardiac transplantation is planned or
             anticipated.

          -  Active respiratory illness, or other acute infection.
