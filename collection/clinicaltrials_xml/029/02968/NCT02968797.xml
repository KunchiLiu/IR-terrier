  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SafeSed prototype monitors respiratory parameters by tracking chest movements with optical
      and accelerometer markers. The respiratory parameters are compared to respiratory parameters
      measured by a spirometer and a capnograph.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients performing endoscopy procedures under sedation at the gastro clinic will be
      monitored by SafeSed in addition to being monitored by capnography, used by an anaesthetist.
      All patients will be monitored using the same two techniques (Safesed and Capnography). No
      clinical decisions will be made based upon the data generated by the Safesed system.

      The data from all sources will be compared (post factum) to validate SafeSed performance.

      The data collected on the SafeSed prototype will not be used for treatment of the patient.

      The comparative analysis will be free vto be used by the sponsor.

    <description>Validation of SafeSed performance by comparing to capnography. The RR and ETCO2 levels will be collected into a PC, and stored with a continuous time-stamp. RR, TD and MV calculations using the SafeSed markers chest movements will be stored at the same PC using the same time-stamp. Comparisson will show correlation between deterioration events of respiratory parameters. This comparison will be the outcome of off-line analysis.</description>
