    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how apolactoferrin (an iron-depleted form of
      lactoferrin) may improve mobility and memory in older adults with chronic inflammation.
      Lactoferrin, a known anti-inflammatory agent found in milk, has recently been made available
      in a controlled, pharmaceutical grade capsule. As part of this double blinded and randomized
      study, participants will take daily dosages of lactoferrin or its matched placebo. To
      measure the effects of lactoferrin on chronic inflammation and ultimately on improving
      mobility and memory over 6 months, participants will provide blood samples and complete
      physical and cognitive tests. By measuring biomarkers in the blood as well as changes in
      physical and cognitive measures, the investigators will gain an understanding of how
      lactoferrin may improve chronic inflammation in older adults, and an understanding of
      whether improving chronic inflammation will improve cognitive and physical function.

    <measure>Attenuating cognitive decline as measured by the digital symbol substitution test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The test taker is given a key consisting of numbers 1-9 that are paired with a unique symbol. Below the key is a randomly generated list of the numbers repeated several times. The test taker is allowed 90 seconds to assign the correct symbol to the number on the list. The test administrator then scores the number of correct answers over the 90 second test time, and assigns a total score based on one point for each correct answer.</description>

    <measure>Attenuating cognitive decline as measured by the trail making test A and B.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For test A, the test taker is given a sheet of paper that has the numbers 1-25 within individual circles randomly distributed on the page. The test taker is asked to connect the numbers sequentially over a period of 3 minutes. The score is recorded as the time it takes to complete the task in seconds. For test B, the test taker is given a piece of paper that has numbers 1-13 and letters A-L. Each letter or number is inside of a circle. The test taker must then draw a line from one circled number to the next circled letter (ie. 1 to A to 2 to B to 3 to C etc.) over a period of 360 seconds. The time it takes to record this task correctly is recorded in seconds.</description>

    <measure>Physical mobility as measured by 4 meter walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A standard measurement of 4 meters is marked on a flat, long floor surface. The test taker is asked to walk the length at their usual pace while the test giver is recording the time with a stop watch. This test is repeated twice, and the average of the two recorded times is used as the data point.</description>

    <measure>Physical mobility as measured by 6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A measured course is set up in an open area on a hard flat surface. The test taker walks on this measured course for 6 minutes, and the test administrators calculates the distance traveled over 6 minutes. The test taker is allowed to rest as is needed.</description>
