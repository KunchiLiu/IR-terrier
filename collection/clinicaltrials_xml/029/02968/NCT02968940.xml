  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how safe and effective treatment with the combination
      of Avelumab and radiation is for IDH mutant gliomas that have transformed to glioblastoma
      after chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Avelumab (MSB0010718C) is a fully human antibody of
      the immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) isotype that specifically targets and blocks the
      Programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) for Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1).

      Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1. This removes the
      suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumor cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cells,
      resulting in the restoration of cytotoxic T cell response.

             14. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to father a child must
             agree to use highly effective contraception while on study drug and for 60 days after
             the last dose of Avelumab. WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 28 days
             of initiation of dosing. (Note: The effects of the trial drug on the developing human
             fetus are unknown; thus, WOCBP and men able to father a child must agree to use 2
             highly effective contraception methods). Women may be included if they are either
             surgically sterile (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 weeks prior
             with confirmation of reproductive status by follow up hormone level assessment) or
             are postmenopausal (natural, spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
             profile for ≥1 year or 6 months with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20
             pg/mL). Highly effective contraception is defined as a method with a failure rate of
             less than 1 % per year, including but not limited to:

        a. True Abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
        subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, post-ovulation methods) and
        withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

        b. Sterilization: Surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) as above,
        or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior.

        c. Male Partner Sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the
        absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised
        male partner should be the sole partner for that participant.

        d. Use of a combination of any two of the following:

        1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 2. Barrier

        spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository e. Appropriate hormonal contraceptives
        (including any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen
        and/or a progestational agent - including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or
        intramuscular agents) 15. Willing to and capable of providing written informed consent, or
