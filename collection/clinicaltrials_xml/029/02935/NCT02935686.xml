  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess safety/tolerability of the different vaccine
      regimens and to assess envelope (Env)-binding antibody (Ab) responses of the 2 different
      vaccine regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the treatment received), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive
      substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a
      clinical trial), parallel-group (each treatment group will be treated at the same time),
      multicenter (more than one clinical site) study in healthy human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV)-uninfected adults. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: a 6-week screening period;
      a 48-week vaccination period; and a follow-up period to the final visit at Week 72. The
      approximate duration of the study will be approximately 78 weeks. Participants safety will
      be monitored throughout the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of medical history, physical examination,
             and vital signs measurement performed at screening

          -  Participants are negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at
             screening

          -  Participants are amenable to HIV-risk reduction counseling and committed to
             maintaining behavior consistent with low risk of HIV exposure through the last
             required protocol clinic visit

          -  All female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum
             (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at the screening visit, and a negative
             urine pregnancy test pre-dose on Day 1

          -  Participants are willing/able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions
             specified in the protocol and study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has chronic hepatitis B (measured by hepatitis B surface antigen test) or active
             hepatitis C (measured by hepatitis C virus [HCV] Ab test; if positive, HCV
             ribonucleic acid [RNA] polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test will be used to confirm
             active versus past HCV infection), active syphilis infection, chlamydia, gonorrhea,
             or trichomonas

          -  In the 12 months prior to randomization, participant has a history of newly acquired
             herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), syphilis, gonorrhea, non-gonococcal urethritis,
             chlamydia, pelvic inflammatory disease, trichomonas, mucopurulent cervicitis,

          -  Participant has had major surgery (eg, requiring general anesthesia) within the 4
             weeks before screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery
             planned through the course of the study

          -  Participant has had a thyroidectomy or active thyroid disease requiring medication
             during the last 12 months (not excluded: a stable thyroid supplementation)

          -  Current or past drug/alcohol use that investigator assesses poses any more than a
             remotely increased risk of the ability of the participant to comply with the protocol
             requirements

          -  Has been in receipt of any licensed vaccine within 14 days prior to the first dose of
             study vaccine or placebo, plans to receive within 14 days after the first study
             vaccination, or plans to receive within 14 days before or after the second, third or
             fourth vaccination

          -  Is a recipient of a prophylactic or therapeutic HIV vaccine candidate at any time, or
             a recipient of other experimental vaccine(s) within the last 12 months. For
             participants who received an experimental vaccine (except HIV vaccine) more than 12
             months ago, documentation of the identity of the experimental vaccine must be
             provided to the sponsor, who will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis
