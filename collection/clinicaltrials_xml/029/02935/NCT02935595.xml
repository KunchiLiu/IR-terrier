      The present proposal aims to combine state-of-the-art integrated transcranial brain
      stimulation, electroencephalographic recording techniques with genetics and computational
      modeling to unveil the mechanisms underlying a fundamental cortical network process -
      synchronization of neuronal activity in the gamma band (30-80 Hz) - and the sources of its
      intersubject variability. By measuring the entrainment of prefrontal cortex produced by weak
      oscillatory currents, the study team will provide a new non-invasive strategy to derive
      robust estimates of the cortical ability to support gamma oscillations, critically
      overcoming limitations associated with current approaches and allowing measures solely
      dependent on intrinsic regional cortico-thalamic properties. Consistent with molecular
      evidence and the investigators biophysical models of gamma oscillations, the study team
      expects that such unambiguous measurement of cortical capabilities will straightforwardly
      map onto key genetic underpinnings related to the dopamine and neuregulin signaling
      pathways. These computational models will be used to offer critical mechanistic insights
      linking genetic variations to variability in emergent circuit-level activity in the form of
      cortical gamma oscillations.

      The primary goal of the project is to study the effect of Ketamine on cortical
      neurophysiological function in Treatment Resistant Depression(TRD) patients. There are three
      key preclinical findings regarding Ketamine antidepressant effects that motivate the current
      study: a) low dose Ketamine causes early increase in glutamate neurotransmission; b)
      Ketamine initiates synaptic plasticity; c) ketamine infusion leads to rapid improvement in
      depression symptoms; d) specific expression and/or methylation markers measured in blood
      cells isolated treated ex vivo with ketamine will significantly correlate with the clinical
      response to treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression; The proposal
      essentially employs robust and non-invasive neurophysiological techniques, Auditory Steady
      State Response(ASSR)-gamma oscillatory response and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation(TMS)
      cortical excitability to investigate the above findings in patients with treatment resistant
      depression.

      Study:

      In the first session, one group of TRD patients receive low dose Ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over
      40 minutes while the other group of TRD patients receive placebo-saline infusion. In the
      second visit, the patients who received ketamine in the first visit will receive
      placebo-saline infusion and the patients who received placebo-saline infusion will receive a
      ketamine infusion. The study will be randomized such that in the first session, 5 patients
      will receive ketamine infusion and 5 patients will receive placebo. The randomization will
      be broken and the data analyzed. The study will then continue with the remaining 10
      patients, where 5 of them will receive ketamine infusion and 5 patients will receive placebo
      infusion in the first session.

      Ketamine Infusion:

      The study team will use slow infusions of ketamine/placebo-saline solution over a time
      period of 40 minutes. Study drug will be provided in identical syringes, containing clear
      solutions of 1 mL of ketamine, e.g. 100 mg/mL with 9 mL of normal saline or just 1 ml saline
      solution.

      Cortical Excitability:

      TMS stimulation will be applied to the corresponding region of the contralateral primary
      motor cortex to determine motor threshold and to examine the motor cortical excitability
      measures after Ketamine. The optimal coil position will be determined by moving the TMS coil
      in 1-cm increments over the motor cortical area while delivering single or paired magnetic
      pulses and by observing maximal contraction of the contralateral abductor pollicis brevis
      (APB). Electromyography readings will be obtained from the APB muscle. TMS stimulation will
      then be applied to Left DLPFC or Left Brodmann Area 6 to investigate cortical excitability
      changes after ketamine. Electroencephalography(EEG) recordings will be concurrent with TMS
      procedure.

      ASSR/EEG paradigm:

      Participants may engage in the auditory steady state response task where click trains of
      500-ms duration will be presented binaurally at 65 Â± 5 decibel(dB). The click train
      repetition frequencies will be 40 Hz and presented in the context of an auditory oddball
      paradigm to ensure participant attention to the stimuli. This task will be done while
      participants undergo EEG recordings.

      Blood Tests:

      Gene Expression and Methylation:

      To identify alterations in gene expression and methylation markers induced by the ex vivo
      treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from symptomatic patients with
      treatment-resistant depression with ketamine and assess their correlations with clinical
      response (as measured by the reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - HDRS). For
      that end blood samples will be collected from all subjects immediately before the first
      administration of ketamine.

      Brain-derived neurotrophic factor,(BDNF):

      Serum BDNF tests will be performed. For that end blood samples will be collected from all
      subjects.
