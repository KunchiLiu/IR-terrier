      A proof of principle single-centre, randomized-controlled, examiner-blind, two treatment
      group study to investigate the efficacy of an experimental 15% w/w dissolvable strip in
      relieving dentine hypersensitivity (DH) after a single application and up to 4 hours after
      application compared to no treatment.

      This will be a single-centre, randomized-controlled, examiner-blind, two treatment group
      (test and no treatment), parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity
      score of the two selected test teeth) study, in healthy participants with at least two
      sensitive teeth that meet all the criteria at the screening and the baseline pre-treatment
      visit. DH will be assessed at baseline (pre-treatment), and 10mins, 2 &amp; 4 hours
      post-treatment.

    <description>The examiner will indicate the participant's response to the evaporative air stimulus, after the stimulation of each individual tooth, using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale as follows: 0 Participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus, 3 Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and requests discontinuation of the stimulus.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in tactile threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>At 10 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner will assess the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allows the application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force is reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth is determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort or pain. The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses is recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used will be 20g; at all subsequent visits, it will be 80g.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in numerical rating scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At 10 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate the intensity of their response to the evaporative air stimulus using a 10 point numerical rating scale of 1 (No Pain) to 10 (Intense Pain).</description>
