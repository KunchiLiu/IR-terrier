    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether combining cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
      with task-oriented balance training (TOBT) is more effective than general health education
      (GHE) together with TOBT in promoting fear of falling and reducing activity avoidance
      behavior.

      The null hypothesis of this study will be that no significant difference in the efficacy of
      the two treatments (CBT + TOBT; GHE + TOBT) in promoting fear of falling and reducing fear
      avoidance behavior, and thus no significant difference in improving balance ability,
      reducing fall risks, improving health-related quality of life and community reintegration of
      people with stroke.
