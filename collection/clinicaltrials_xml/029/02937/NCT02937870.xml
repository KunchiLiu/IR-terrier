      The objective of this 4-treatment, 4-period, randomized, crossover, proof of principle bite
      force study will be to compare bite force measurements over a 12 hour period across two
      (test) cream denture adhesives, with a currently marketed cream denture adhesive (positive
      control), and a negative/no treatment control.

    <textblock>
      This will be a 4-treatment, 4-period, randomized, crossover, proof of principle bite force
      study which will compare bite force measurements over a 12 hour period across two cream
      denture adhesives with a currently marketed cream denture adhesive (positive control), and a
      negative/no treatment control. A short questionnaire regarding the flavor and texture
      characteristics of each denture adhesive after a single use will also be administered to
      give an indication of participant satisfaction of these attributes.

    <description>Efficacy will be assessed by area over baseline (AOB)over 12 hours for the incisal bite force. The difference will be estimated for the test product 1 compared to no adhesive (negative control). AOB over 12 hours will be calculated as (AUC 0-12)/12 minus baseline bite force. Area Under the Curve (AUC) will be calculated from 0 to 12 hours (AUC 0-12) using the trapezoidal method.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Demonstrates understanding of the study procedures, restrictions and willingness to
             participate as evidenced by voluntary written informed consent and has received a
             signed and dated copy of the informed consent form.

          -  Aged between 18 to 85 years.

          -  Good general and mental health with, in the opinion of the investigator or medically
             qualified designee: No clinically significant and relevant abnormalities in medical
             history or upon oral examination and absence of any condition that could affect the
             participant's safety or wellbeing or their ability to understand and follow study
             procedures and requirements.

          -  Completely edentulous maxillary arch restored with a conventional full acrylic based
             upper complete denture. Dentate, partial or full edentulous mandibular arch. Partial
             or full edentulous arch may be restored with a stable complete, partial or implant
             supported denture. Maxillary dentures must be considered to be moderately
             well-fitting at the screening visit (Kapur Index, Olshan Modification: retention
             score &gt;=2, stability score &gt;=2). Maxillary dentures and mandibular dentures, if
             present, must be considered to be well-made based on design and construction criteria
             specified in the protocol. The qualifying maxillary incisal bite force readings
             (without adhesive) must be less than or equal to 9 pounds (lb) at the Screening Visit
             and subsequent visit pre-treatment baseline bites. At least 2 of the 4 qualifying
             bite readings at the Screening Visit must be reproducible (+/- 2lb). At subsequent
             visits the bite force readings must be within +/-2lb for 1 of the 3 practice bites
             and the pre-treatment baseline bite.

          -  Understands and is willing, able and likely to comply with all study procedures and
             restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A woman who is known to be pregnant or who is intending to become pregnant (self
             reported) over the duration of the study.

          -  A woman who is breast-feeding.

          -  Implanted with a cardiac pacemaker.

          -  Daily doses of medication that might interfere with the ability to perform the study
             according to protocol (as determined by the Investigator).

          -  Taking or have taken a bisphosphonate drug for treatment of osteoporosis.

          -  A serious chronic disease requiring hospitalization.

          -  Any condition not previously mentioned that in the Investigator's opinion may impair
             the study evaluation.

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely
             related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients.

          -  Any clinically significant or relevant oral abnormality (e.g. temporomandibular joint
             [TMJ] problems) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect the
             participant's participation in the study.

          -  Any participant clinically identified as having an incisal bite relation which could
             affect the bite force measurements.

          -  Severe dry mouth that may affect denture retention in the opinion of the
             Investigator.

          -  OST examination findings such as stomatitis, open sores, lesions, redness or swelling
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect the participant's
             participation in the study.

          -  Participation in another clinical study (including cosmetic studies) or receipt of an
             investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit.

          -  Previous participation in this study.

          -  Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse.

          -  A participant who is unwilling to refrain from smoking, including e-cigarettes and
             the use of chewing tobacco or other tobacco products for the duration of screening

          -  An employee of the sponsor or the study site or members of their immediate family.
