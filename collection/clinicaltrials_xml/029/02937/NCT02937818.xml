      Study design This is a Phase II, open-label, multi-drug, multi-center, multi-arm,
      signal-searching study in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who
      have refractory or resistant disease from prior platinum-based chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is modular in design, allowing evaluation of the preliminary efficacy, safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of novel combinations of immunotherapies and/or
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair inhibitors in patients with platinum refractory or
      resistant extensive-stage-disease SCLC. Patient who has progressive disease (PD) during
      first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum refractory) or PD within 90 days after
      completing first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum resistant) will be enrolled to
      the study. The primary objective of the study is to assess the preliminary efficacy of each
      treatment arm based on objective response rate (ORR).

      This study will consist of a number of arms (sub-studies), each evaluating the efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of a specific agent or combination. This study will open with 2
      arms (Arms A and B), and additional arms may open, provided there is compelling rationale
      for the combination and safe and tolerable doses and schedules have been determined from
      ongoing Phase I studies. There are 2 pre-defined arms:

      A. Durvalumab + tremelimumab followed by durvalumab monotherapy B. AZD1775 + carboplatin
      (CBDP)

             obtained from the patient/legal representative prior to performing any
             protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations.

          3. Histologically or cytologically documented extensive disease American Joint Committee
             on Cancer Stage IV SCLC (T any, N any, M1 a/b), including patients with:

               -  T3-4 due to multiple lung nodules that are too extensive or have tumor/nodal

                  suspected brain metastases at screening should have a computed tomography
                  (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain prior to study entry.

          4. Patients must have demonstrated progressive disease (PD) either during first-line
             platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum refractory) or within 90 days of completing
             platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum resistant), and have not received further
             treatment apart from first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

          6. At least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at
             baseline as â‰¥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have a
             short axis â‰¥15 mm) with CT or MRI and that is suitable for accurate repeated
             measurements as per RECIST 1.1 guidelines.

          7. Willingness and ability to comply with study and follow-up procedures.

          8. Life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.

         10. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for
             female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have
             been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following
             agespecific requirements apply:

               -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and folliculostimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Women â‰¥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt;1 year interval since last menses, or
                  underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

             EXCLUSION:

         11. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca
             staff and/or staff at the study site).

         12. Previous enrollment in the present study.

         13. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product (IP) during
             the last 4 weeks.

         14. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study unless it is an observational
             (non-interventional) clinical study or the follow-up period of an interventional
             study.

         15. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the
             first dose of IP. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent is
             acceptable.

         16. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the
             evaluation of the IP or interpretation of patient safety or study results, including
             but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs from the study medications,
             or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent.

         17. Radiation therapy to the chest and whole-brain irradiation must be completed at least
             4 weeks prior to start of study treatment, and patients must have recovered from any
             acute adverse effects prior to start of study treatment. An exception to this is
             palliative radiotherapy for bone lesions and must be completed before the first dose
             of study treatment.

         18. Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced pneumonitis,
             radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically
             active interstitial lung disease.

         19. History of hypersensitivity to active or inactive excipients of any investigational
             drug in the study or drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to those
             investigated in the study.

         20. Patients with Grade â‰¥2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis after
             consultation with AstraZeneca Study Physician.

         21. History of another primary malignancy except for:

               -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease â‰¥5
                  years before the first dose of study drug and of low potential risk for
                  recurrence

               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease

               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease (eg, cervical
                  cancer in situ)

         22. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

         23. Spinal cord compression unless asymptomatic or treated and stable off steroids and
             anticonvulsants for at least 1 month prior to study treatment.

         24. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
