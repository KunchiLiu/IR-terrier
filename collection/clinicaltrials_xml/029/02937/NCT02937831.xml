      The purpose of this survey is to understand the following items observed in the actual
      clinical use of RIXUBIS.

        1. Unexpected adverse drug reactions

        2. Occurrence of adverse drug reactions in the actual clinical use

        3. Factors that may affect safety and effectiveness

        4. Occurrence of Factor IX (FIX) inhibitor development in patients with coagulation FIX
           deficiency

        5. Safety and effectiveness for hemophilia B patients who received routine prophylactic
           therapy, on-demand therapy and perioperative therapy
