    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate complete response plus (+) very good partial
      response (CR+VGPR) rate following 4 cycles of induction therapy of daratumumab in
      combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (Dara-CyBorD), in
      previously untreated subjects, and in relapsed subjects with multiple myeloma, as defined by
      the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria.
