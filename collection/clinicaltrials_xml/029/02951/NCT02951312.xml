  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assessed the safety and ability of several doses of an orally inhaled medicine
      [ie, Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution = GIS] to improve airflow in the lungs when
      delivered with an electronic eFlow nebulizer system in patients with Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The study was conducted in 12 patients in 2 parts. Part 1 was
      designed to find the once-a- day GIS dose that produced the highest improvement in lung
      airflow. Part 2 tested the GIS dose with the highest improvement in lung airflow and a
      placebo (ie, no drug) delivered by a general purpose nebulizer. The airflow improvements of
      the same GIS dose were compared between the two nebulizer systems to determine what effect
      the device had on GIS delivery.
