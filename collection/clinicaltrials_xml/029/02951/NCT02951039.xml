  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to understand the risks and benefits of edoxaban use in a real-world clinical
      setting in the Non valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) indication, Daiichi-Sankyo proposed
      this non-interventional study to gain insight into the safety (bleeding, liver adverse
      events, all-cause mortality and other drug related adverse events) and efficacy of edoxaban
      use in non-preselected patients with NVAF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Edoxaban was approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) in Korea (date: 25th,
      August 2015) for the reduction in the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with
      NVAF, treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. Edoxaban was approved
      by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) in Taiwan (date: 24th, February, 2016) for
      the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more
      risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age at least 75 years,
      diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), or treatment of deep
      vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), following 5 to 10 days of initial therapy
      with a parenteral anticoagulant.

      Real world evidence data of routine clinical practice use of edoxaban up to two years will
      be collected and evaluated in approximately 2,500 patients, treated by specialized as well
      as non-specialized physicians in hospital centers.
