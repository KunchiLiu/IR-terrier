      Study B9991011 is a multi-center, international, randomized, open label, 2 component (Phase
      1b followed by Phase 3), parallel-arm study of avelumab in combination with various agents
      for the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The target study population of this Phase 1b/3 registrational study is patients with R/R
      DLBCL who have completed at least 2 (but not more than 4) lines of prior
      rituximab-containing multi-agent chemotherapy, and/or in whom autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT) has failed, or who are not candidates for ASCT or who are not eligible for
      intensive chemotherapy. Patients who are ineligible for intensive second line chemotherapy
      must have received at least one prior rituximab-containing combination chemotherapy regimen.
      The study will assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity of the 3
      avelumab-based combination regimens tested, and collect patient reported outcome (PRO) data.
