    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn more about the effects of different nicotine
      levels in cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). E-cigarettes use water vapor
      to deliver nicotine.

      Length of Study:

      You will have 5 visits over 10-15 weeks. You will be taken off study if you develop serious
      medical problems, intolerable side effects occur, you are not able to follow the study
      directions, or you become pregnant. Your participation may also be stopped by the study
      doctor at any time for any reason.

      Your participation on this study will be over after the follow-up call (30 days after your
      last study visit).

      Smoking Schedule:

      There are 4 phases to this study. Phase 1 (Week 1), Phase 2 (Weeks 2-4), Phase 3 (Weeks
      5-7), and Phase 4 (Weeks 8-10).

      During Week 1, you will be asked to smoke your usual cigarette brand as you normally would.

      During Weeks 2-4, you will be asked to smoke only the study cigarettes provided to you. You
      will receive a larger supply than you normally smoke. You may choose to smoke either menthol
      or non-menthol study cigarettes.

      During Weeks 5-10, you will be asked to smoke only the cigarettes and e-cigarettes provided
      to you. You will smoke either low- or high-nicotine content e-cigarettes for the first 3
      weeks (Phase 3) and then switch to whichever one you have not yet received for the remaining
      3 weeks (Phase 4). Neither you nor the study staff will know the order in which you are
      receiving the high- and low-nicotine content e-cigarettes. However, if needed for your
      safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving. You will watch a
      90-minute video that explains how to smoke the e-cigarettes.

      Study Visits:

      At the Week 1 study visit, you will be given a smartphone to use during the study. If you
      lose the smartphone, you will need to file a police report since the phone is the property
      of MD Anderson. You will not be financially responsible due to the loss of the smartphone.
      This will not affect your compensation. You will receive instructions on how to use it to
      answer questions about your nicotine cravings and mood, and to log your daily smoking
      activity every day for up to 75 days. It should take about 15-30 minutes each day to
      complete these questions. You will be asked to return the smartphone when your participation
      on the study is complete.

      At your first visit, you will be provided with a smart phone device. You will answer
      questions at various points every day for up to 42 days. The questions are about events from
      the previous day, such as cigarettes per day, alcohol you drank, mood, sleep, motivation,
      and if you used your e-cigarette device. You will have multiple assessments during the day.
      These assessments will take up to 30 minutes total per day to complete.

      At Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8:

        -  Your CO level will be measured.

        -  You will complete questionnaires about mood, nicotine withdrawal symptoms and smoking
           behavior. These questionnaires will take about 30 minutes to complete.

        -  You will complete an electronic survey about your opinion of the study cigarettes. This
           survey should take about 1 hour to complete.

        -  Urine will be collected for testing for substances that are related to tobacco.

        -  If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. To take part
           in this study, you must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.

      On or about Day 10 of Phases 1, 2, and 3, you will be asked to collect your urine in the
      morning at home to bring to your Weeks 5, 8, and 10 study visits for testing for substances
      related to tobacco. Your smartphone will alert you when it is time to collect the samples.
      You will be given a cup to collect your urine in and a biohazard storage bag. You will store
      the cup inside the bag and then will store the bag inside the refrigerator until your next
      visit.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      About 25-30 days after your last study visit, if you have any side effects, you will be
      called by a member of the study staff to ask about how you are doing. This call should last
      about 10 minutes.

      Other Information:

        -  You should smoke only the cigarettes assigned to you for 15 weeks. If you smoke other
           cigarettes during the study, or use other nicotine products like nicotine gum, you can
           still be in the study. However, it is important that you tell the study staff about any
           non-study cigarettes, tobacco, or nicotine products that you use.

        -  This study is not a treatment program, however if you choose to reduce the amount you
           smoke or stop smoking entirely, you may still take part in the study. If you decide to
           quit, the study staff will provide you with information about stopping smoking and
           referrals to local treatment programs. If you decide to quit, you can choose whether
           you want to take home your assigned study cigarettes. However, having cigarettes in
           your possession during your quit attempt could make it difficult for you to refrain
           from smoking.

        -  Quitting smoking can greatly improve your health. However, changes in your smoking can
           lead to changes in the levels of drugs you are taking. Please make sure to tell the
           study staff about all the drugs you take. Quitting smoking may alter the way in which
           your body metabolizes certain medications. If you quit smoking and are taking certain
           medications regularly (e.g., medications to treat asthma or diabetes) discuss this with
           your regular doctor to determine if a change in these medications is warranted.

        -  The amount of nicotine in the study cigarettes and e-cigarettes provided to you may be
           lower/higher than your normal brand of cigarettes.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 480 participants will be screened to take part in the study, but only about 160
      participants will be enrolled. All will take part at MD Anderson.
