    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has NOSE Score ≥55.

          2. The subject has dynamic lateral nasal wall insufficiency as confirmed by Positive
             Modified Cottle Maneuver.

          3. The subject is ≥18 years of age.

          4. The subject is willing and able to provide informed consent and comply with the study
             protocol.

          5. The subject is seeking treatment for nasal airway obstruction due to Nasal Valve
             Collapse (NVC) and is willing to undergo an in-office nasal implant procedure alone
             or with a turbinate reduction procedure.

          6. The subject has appropriate nasal and facial anatomy to receive the Latera Implant.

          7. The subject agrees to follow-up examinations through twelve (12) months post
             operatively.

          8. The subject has failed to benefit from appropriate maximal medical management [e.g.,
             nasal steroids (at least 4 weeks); antihistamines; oral decongestants; nasal strips,
             stents, or cones]. Failure of maximal medical management may be from lack of
             effectiveness or tolerability.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is having a concurrent Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) or
             sinuplasty.

          2. The subject has had rhinoplasty within the past twelve (12) months.

          3. The subject is planning to have other concurrent rhinoplasty procedure.

          4. The subject is planning to have other rhinoplasty procedures or will use external
             dilators within twelve (12) months after the index procedure.

          5. The subject has had septoplasty and/or inferior turbinate reduction within the past
             six (6) months.

          6. The subject has, in the view of the clinician, inappropriate fixation on their nasal
             airway.

          7. The subject plans to have any surgical or non-surgical treatment of their nasal
             valve, other than the index procedure, within twelve (12) months of the study.

          8. The subject has a permanent Implant or dilator in the nasal area.

          9. The subject has concomitant inflammatory or infectious skin conditions or unhealed
             wounds in the treatment area.

         10. The subject currently has active nasal vestibulitis.

         11. The subject has a history of nasal vasculitis.

         12. The subject is a chronic systemic steroid or recreational intra-nasal drug user.

         13. The subject has had a cancerous or pre-cancerous lesion and/or has had radiation
             exposure in the treatment area or chemotherapy.

         14. The subject has polyps or pathology (i.e., septal deviation) other than turbinate
             hypertrophy and/or lateral wall insufficiency that would contribute to airway
             obstruction.

         15. The subject has a history of a significant bleeding disorder(s) that would prevent
             healing of the treatment area post procedure.

         16. The subject has a known or suspected allergy to PLA or other absorbable materials.

         17. The subject has a significant systemic disease such as poorly controlled diabetes
             which, in the investigator's opinion, could pre-dispose the subject to poor wound
             healing.

         18. The subject is currently using nasal oxygen or CPAP.

         19. The subject is not a candidate for procedures conducted under local anesthesia and/or
             managed anesthesia care (MAC) or conscious sedation.

         20. Female subjects of child bearing potential, known or suspected to be pregnant or is
             lactating.
