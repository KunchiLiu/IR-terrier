    <textblock>
      This is a safety and pharmacokinetics study of MK-7684 as monotherapy and in combination
      with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adults with metastatic solid tumors for which there is no
      available therapy that is expected to convey clinical benefit. Part A of this study is a
      dose escalation phase. Part B is a dose confirmation phase to estimate the recommended Phase
      2 dose (RPTD) for MK-7684 monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. The primary
      hypothesis is that MK-7684 administered as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab
      is safe when administered at the RPTD.

    <description>During an initial dose evaluation phase, participants will receive dose A, B, C, D, or E of MK-7684 on Day 1 of each infusion cycle (for a maximum of 35 cycles) until the RPTD has been established. The RPTD will be established based on the number of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at each dose level. Once the RPTD is established, participants will continue receiving the RPTD of MK-7684 on Day 1 of each infusion cycle until the 35-cycle limit is reached.</description>

    <description>During an initial dose evaluation phase, participants will receive Dose A, B, C, D, or E of MK-7684 in combination with 200 mg pembrolizumab on Day 1 of each infusion cycle (for a maximum of 35 cycles) until the RPTD of MK-7684 has been established. The RPTD will be established based on the number of DLTs at each dose level.
