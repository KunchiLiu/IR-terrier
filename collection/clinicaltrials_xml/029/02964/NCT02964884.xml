  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder that is associated with a four
      times greater risk of learning disabilities, including reading disabilities, and a
      deficiency of neurofibromin - a protein important in a signaling pathway that regulates
      learning and memory. Our previous work (NS49096) demonstrated that school-age children with
      NF+RD can respond to standard phonologically-based reading tutoring originally developed to
      treat reading disability in the general population. Combining our work with that by other
      researchers suggesting that a medication (Lovastatin) may counteract the effects of the
      deficient neurofibromin, and possibly ameliorate learning disabilities in NF1, the
      investigator propose to examine the synergistic effects of medication plus reading tutoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurofibromitosis Type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome. The
      most common concern of NF1 is learning disabilities (LDs). Approximately half of children
      with NF1 have LDs, the most common of which are reading disabilities (RDs).The purpose of
      this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics and treatment of RDs
      in NF1.

      The Investigator will evaluate three different groups (see list below) to determine if there
      are differential outcomes in these groups of children.with NF+RD.

        1. Reading tutoring program and a medication called Lovastatin

        2. Reading tutoring program and no Lovastatin (placebo)

        3. No reading (sham) tutoring and Lovastatin

    <measure>Experimental Short-Term Learning of Letters</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In this task, children learn new symbols associated with new sounds (i.e., &quot;fake letters&quot;). Children will be taught these &quot;fake letters&quot; by the same methods used in CTR to teach sound-symbol associations for real letters, i.e., focusing in on mouth movements. Each visit, children learn a new set of 10 &quot;fake letters&quot; and associate a phoneme not in the English language with them. The dependent measure is the number of trials taken to learn the fake letters, and accuracy and reaction time associated with recognizing learned vs novel fake letters. Note that the accuracy and reaction time task builds upon the letters learned at prior visits, so that the investigator will be able to test longer-term retention/learning (i.e., the 10 letters learned in Visit 1 will also be in Visit 2a, along with the newly learned letters in Visit 2a, etc.).</description>

    <measure>Visuospatial Learning and Memory, Biological Motion vs Coherent Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants identify whether movement of a figure on a computer screen is to the left or to the right. The figure consists of 12 lights placed on the major joints and head of a person wearing dark clothing, and the person is filmed as they move about. A single form (one frame) looks like an irregular cluster of dots. However, when frames are viewed in succession, they are perceived as a person walking. The dependent measure is the threshold for detection of motion.
• Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO, Forms J and H)98 requires the judgment of spatial relationships between two lines compared to a reference of a protractor-like half-circle of 11 lines. The Investigator will create 4 forms from the two already existing by splitting each test in half by selecting every other item, a method used by others (Leach et al., 2003). This will allow us to generate 4 different versions of the JLO.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        This study will be open to all native English speakers who meet eligibility criteria
        regardless of race, gender, minority or socioeconomic status. A child will be excluded if
        he/she meets any of the following criteria, which will be determined by initial telephone
        screening as well as review of medical/developmental history prior to and during testing:

          1. previous diagnosis of Intellectual Disability;

          2. known uncorrectable visual impairment;

          3. documented hearing impairment greater than or equal to a 25 dB loss;

          4. medical contraindication to MRI procedures (e.g., metal devices);

          5. known IQ below 70;

          6. a pervasive developmental disorder; and

          7. any known neurologic pathology, including epilepsy, spina bifida, cerebral palsy,
             traumatic brain injury, optic gliomas, and brain tumors (other than UBOs).

          8. Comorbid severe psychiatric disorders will also be excluded.

        Children who meet criteria for ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, adjustment disorder,
        and/or mild depression will be eligible as long as they are not taking psychotropic
        medications, with the exception of stimulant medication for ADHD. Because ADHD is highly
        comorbid with NF1 (~50%; 116), and it is important that findings of this clinical trial
        are generalizable (cf. 117), the Investigator will include children with ADHD including
        those taking stimulant medications. Because the investigator recognizes the importance of
        taking ADHD into account, the investigator will also incorporate measures of ADHD (with
        both categorical and continuous variables) as well as stimulant status as moderators in
        our analyses. This approach is consistent with other Lovastatin clinical trials in NF1
        (e.g., 8).

        Reading disability (RD) will be defined by a score less than the 25th percentile on the
        Letter Word Identification and Word Attack subtests from the Woodcock Johnson
        Psychoeducational Battery-III. This is an accepted definition of RD in reading research
        118. The Investigator anticipates that only a few recruited participants will not meet RD
        criteria because the study is unlikely to appeal to families with children who are not
        struggling academically; however, if criteria are not met these participants will not be
        included in the randomization procedure for the clinical trial but, as a courtesy to the
        family, will be allowed the opportunity to participate in tutoring if they choose to do
        so.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        ADHD symptomology as well as status will be determined by DSM-5 criteria that require that
        symptoms be present in at least two settings; therefore, two questionnaires each will be
        administered to each child's parent and teacher. See below for specific criteria for ADHD
        diagnosis confirmation/exclusion.

        Measures to Determine ADHD Status and/or other Diagnoses: The following measures will be
        used to determine ADHD status and presence of any psychiatric diagnoses that would
        preclude inclusion in the study. All of these measures were developed under DSM-IV
        guidelines. The Investigator is now under DSM-5 criteria but there has not been enough
        time for measures to be tested against DSM-5; however the measures below remain
        appropriate to capture the necessary data for us to make a determination about the
        relevant comorbid diagnoses. In particular, the diagnostic criteria for ADHD continue to
        be based on the same 18 diagnostic symptoms, split equally between inattentive and
        hyperactive/impulsive behaviors, with a threshold of at least six symptoms in at least one
        domain to make a diagnosis. Also the DSM-5 diagnostic specifiers map directly onto the
        previous DSM-IV subtypes of ADHD. Changes to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria include a less
        stringent requirement for symptoms to have been problematic by 12-years old compared to
        the DSM-IV age of 7-years. There remains a requirement for symptoms to occur in more than
        one setting. Overall, the measures below remain appropriate to capture the necessary data
        to make a determination about ADHD diagnosis, and the Investigator will also have the
        continuous data which may be the most pertinent for our research questions. Parents and
        teachers will fill out questionnaires and a clinical interview with the parent(s) will be
        conducted.

        Conners Third Edition (Conners 3, 119) is a behavioral rating scale that provides
        information on a variety of symptoms of ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity)
        as well as cross-cutting symptoms of anxiety, and depression. Completed by parent and
        teacher using the appropriate forms for each.

        Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV--Home and School Versions 120 is
        a Likert scale completed about the child's behavior over the past 6 months. The items were
        developed to assess symptoms of ADHD. Completed by parent and teacher using the
        appropriate forms for each.

        Diagnostic Interview for Children, Fourth Edition (DICA-IV; 121) is a semi-structured
        interview, designed for determining psychiatric diagnoses, including ADHD. Completed by
        parent only.

        Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function 122 is an executive function
        questionnaire that captures Initiate, Inhibit, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, and
        Self-Monitor. Completed by parent only.

        Pediatric Medical and Developmental History Questionnaire (developed in house) will be
        used to screen for conditions that would preclude inclusion in the study by providing a
        review of the child's birth, developmental, and medical history. Completed by parent only.

        ADHD Status: ADHD status will be based on DSM-5 criteria. All diagnoses will be confirmed
        Dr. Rimrodt, a neurodevelopmental pediatrician. To meet criteria for ADHD, children must
        score positively on one of two parent scales and have a positive ADHD diagnosis on the
        DICA-IV. Specifically, they must have a rating of 2 or higher for 6 of 9 items assessing
        inattention and/or 6 of 9 items assessing hyperactivity/impulsivity on the ADHD Rating
        Scale IV and/or a T-score &gt; 65 on either the Inattention or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity
        scales of the Conners 3. Subjects must also meet criteria for ADHD on one of the two
        teacher ratings scale (Conners 3 or DuPaul). During all testing children with ADHD will
        remain on any prescribed stimulant medications. Children will be considered free of ADHD
        if they do not meet criteria for ADHD on any of the parent or teacher rating scales used
        to diagnose ADHD (i.e. they must have a rating of 2 or higher for fewer than 4 of 9 items
        assessing inattention and fewer than 4 of 9 items assessing hyperactivity/impulsivity on
        the ADHD Rating Scale IV and a T-score &lt; 60 on both the Hyperactivity and Inattention
        scales of the parent or teacher Conners 3). They also cannot meet criteria for ADHD on the
        DICA-IV. Participants with ambiguous ADHD diagnosis
