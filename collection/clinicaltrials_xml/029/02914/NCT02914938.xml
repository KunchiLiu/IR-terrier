  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the minimum biologically effective dose of ME-401;
      determine the maximally tolerated dose of ME-401 and determine the dose limiting toxicities
      of ME-401. Secondary objectives to evaluate the safety profile and efficacy of ME-401.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose escalation/expansion study with seven planned dose
      levels (Cohorts) of ME-401. DLT will be assessed within the first 56 days (8 weeks). A
      Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) model will be used to determine dose
      escalation/de-escalation.

      Dose levels will consist of 6 subjects and can be expanded to enroll up to 12 subjects. The
      total number of cohorts depends on the incidence of DLTs.
