  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical consistency of three production lots
      of the Porcine circovirus (PCV)-free liquid formulation of oral live attenuated human
      rotavirus (HRV) vaccine and to evaluate the PCV-free liquid formulation of HRV vaccine as
      compared to the currently licensed lyophilised formulation of the HRV vaccine in terms of
      immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety when administered as a two-dose vaccination in
      healthy infants starting at age 6-12 weeks. No new subjects will be enrolled in the
      extension phase of the study

      -  Experimental design: Phase IIIA, observer-blind, randomised (1:1:1:1), controlled,
           multi-centric, with four parallel groups and a staggered enrolment (Part A and Part B).

        -  Duration of the study: The intended duration of the study, per subject, will be
           approximately 7-8 months including the 6 months of extended safety follow-up period
           after the last dose of HRV vaccine.

             -  Epoch 001: Primary starting at Visit 1 (Day 0) and ending at the safety follow-up
                contact (Month 7-8).

        -  Primary completion Date (PCD): Visit 3 (Month 2-4).

        -  End of Study (EoS): Last testing results released of samples collected at Visit 3 or
           Last Subject Last Visit (LSLV) (Follow up contact at month 7-8).

        -  Study Groups:

             -  PCV-free HRV liquid formulation lot A (also referred to as Liq_A Group)

             -  PCV-free HRV liquid formulation lot B (also referred to as Liq_B Group)

             -  PCV-free HRV liquid formulation lot C (also referred to as Liq_C Group)

             -  GSK Biologicals' currently licensed lyophilised HRV formulation (also referred to
                as Lyo Group)

        -  Control:active control-GSK Biologicals' currently licensed lyophilised HRV vaccine

        -  Vaccination schedule: Two doses of HRV vaccine to be administered according to a 0, 1-2
           month schedule according to the immunisation schedule for RV vaccine.
