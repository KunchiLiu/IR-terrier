      Evaluation of the Aerin Medical Device used for the treatment of nasal obstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-significant risk, prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of the Aerin Medical device (Vivaer Stylus) when used to deliver
      radiofrequency (RF) energy to the nasal valve area to improve symptoms in those diagnosed
      with nasal airway obstruction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Seeking treatment for nasal obstruction and willing to undergo an office-based
             procedure

          -  NOSE score of â‰¥ 60 at Baseline

          -  Nasal valve is a primary or significant contributor to the subject's nasal
             obstruction as determined by the study investigator (based on clinical presentation,
             physical examination, nasal endoscopy, etc.) and the subject has a positive response
             to any of the following temporary measures (based on patient history or office exam):

          -  Use of external nasal dilator strips (e.g., Breathe Right Strips)

          -  Q-Tip test (manual intranasal lateralization)

          -  Use of nasal stents

          -  Cottle Maneuver (manual lateral retraction of the cheek)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior surgical treatment of the nasal valve

          -  Rhinoplasty, septoplasty, inferior turbinate reduction or other surgical nasal
             procedures within the past twelve (12) months

          -  Chronic sinusitis, recurrent sinusitis, or allergies leading to nasal obstruction

          -  Septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, polyps, or ptotic nose tip believed to be a
             significant contributor to the subject's nasal obstruction symptoms

          -  Known or suspected allergies or contraindications for any general or local anesthetic
             agents and / or any antibiotic medications

          -  Known or suspected to be pregnant, or is lactating

          -  Other medical conditions which in the opinion of the investigator could predispose
             the subject to poor wound healing or increased surgical risk
