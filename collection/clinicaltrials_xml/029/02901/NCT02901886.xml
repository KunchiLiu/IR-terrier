    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the effect of an intensive smoking cessation intervention
      (motivational counseling combined with nicotine replacement) on smoking cessation and
      disease activity in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Half of the patients will
      participate in a smoking cessation intervention; the other half will receive usual
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco smoking is a well-known environmental risk factor for developing rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). The onset of RA can occur in all age groups, with the majority being women
      aged 50-60 years. RA is a chronic inflammatory disease and cannot be cured. However, the
      activity of the disease can be reduced by medication. During periods with high disease
      activity, patients experience increased pain and fatigue and subsequent restrictions in
      social life, psychical activity and activities of daily life. Furthermore, the inflammatory
      process underlying RA can cause pain, fatigue, reduced health-related quality of life and
      reduced physical function. Patients with RA are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases
      similar to the risk demonstrated in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, several studies
      indicate that smokers with inflammatory arthritis tend to experience more pain and fatigue,
      and a reduced quality of life compared to non-smokers.

      The primary aim of this study is to examine if an intensive smoking cessation intervention
      leads to smoking cessation and reduced disease activity in patients with RA. Secondary aims
      are to examine the effect on the risk of cardiovascular diseases, lung function, psychical
      function, health-related quality of life, pain and fatigue in patients with RA.

      Material and Methods

      Study design: A multicenter randomized 2-armed controlled intervention study (RCT). It is
      not possible to blind patients or smoking cessation counsellors to the intervention. All
      outcomes will be assessed by blinded outcome assessors. Data on remaining secondary outcomes
      will be patient-reported. Baseline and outcome data will be collected at baseline before
      randomization, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post intervention.

      Study setting: Patients will be recruited from rheumatology outpatient clinics at University
      Hospital Rigshospitalet - Glostrup (Capital Region of Denmark), Frederiksberg Hospital
      (Capital Region of Denmark) and Preventive Cardio-Rheuma Clinic, Diakonhjemmet Hospital
      Oslo, Norway.

      Randomization and blinding: After accepting participation in the study, baseline data will
      be collected. Following this, patients will be randomized using computer-generated
      stratified block randomization (blocks of 6-10 patients). Patients will be allocated 1:1 to
      either 1) the intervention group (N = 75) or 2) the control group (N = 75).

      Data collection: Outcomes will be assessed four times up to 13.5 months post-intervention:
      1) at baseline 2) 3 months post-intervention 3) 6 months post-intervention 4) 12
      post-intervention.

      At baseline, patients will be asked to complete self-reported questionnaires regarding
      demographics, lifestyle, smoking history, consumption of pain medication and alcohol
      consumption. Charlson's co-morbidity Scale is used for assessing co-morbidity based on data
      from the patient's chart. In addition, data on medical treatment, IgM-RF (rheumatoid factor)
      and Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (Anti-CCP) status will be obtained from the DANBIO
      registry.

      At each subsequent follow-up, patients will be asked to complete self-reported
      questionnaires regarding smoking status, disease activity (FLARE instrument), psychical
      function (HAQ), and health-related quality of life (SF-36 and EQ-5D), pain (VAS scale) and
      fatigue (BRAF-NRS). All patient-reported questionnaires will be completed electronically
      using a tablet. The tablet is exclusively for use in this study. Arterial stiffness, blood
      pressure, pulse, weight and waist circumference will be assessed at baseline and all
      follow-up visits. Blood samples will be drawn and analyzed for C-reactive protein (CRP),
      triglycerides, cholesterol level and HbA1c.

      All outcomes excluding patient-reported outcomes will be assessed by project nurses blinded
      to the patients' group allocation.

      Ethics, confidentiality and dissemination: The study will be carried out in accordance with
      the Helsinki Declaration. The study has been approved by The Regional Committee on Health
      Research Ethics (H-16022001) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (I-suite number 04849).
      All data and information collected during the study will be handled in accordance with the
      Danish Data Protection Agency and Good Clinical Practice.

Individual motivational counseling. The intervention consists of five individual motivational counseling sessions (20 to 40 minutes) within 6 weeks, conducted by an educated smoking cessation counselor. The smoking cessation counselor has been trained in motivational counseling techniques to this specific intervention.
Nicotine replacement therapy. Dose and form of nicotine replacement will be assessed individually using Fagerström's Test for Nicotine Dependence.
Intervention patients will receive a smoking diary in which they can report smoking status and use of nicotine replacement therapy daily.</description>
