  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II multi-center, randomized, double-blind, 24-week, 3-arm, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of
      RO5285119 in children and adolescents aged 5-17 years with ASD who are high functioning
      (intelligence quotient [IQ] greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 70). Enrollment will be staggered,
      starting first with adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years) and then with children (aged 5 to 12
      years). Initially, a first cohort of approximately 24 adolescents will be enrolled together.
      Based on pharmacokinetic evaluation, safety, and tolerability in the first adolescent cohort
      and determined final doses, enrollment of adolescents will resume and the enrollment of a
      first cohort of approximately 24 children (aged 5 to 12 years) can commence. Based on
      acceptable safety and tolerability in the first children cohort and determined final doses,
      enrollment of children will resume.
