  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was aimed to conduct a 3-year perspective study to observe the immunological
      effect of one-dose mumps-containing vaccine, monitor the incidence of mumps in vaccinated
      population aged 2-7 yearsï¼Œand provide basis for adjusting MMR immunization strategy in
      Jiangsu province, China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      in 2-7 years old children with high risk of mumps, epidemiological investigation of the
      serum IgG antibody level were conducted, and then a prospective observational cohort was
      established in the population with a history of mumps vaccination, and the incidence of
      mumps in each antibody level group will be observed, the relationship between different
      antibody levels and the incidence after mumps vaccinated were analyzed, to explore
      attenuation of mumps IgG antibody levels in the body,S79 vaccine strain against F genotype
      mumps' antigenic cross-reactivity and the protective effect of antibodies.
