  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is common and deadly but without
      therapy. Inconclusive studies such as TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart
      Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist) suggest spironolactone may be effective in HFPEF,
      but it is generic and will not be studied by industry.

      SPIRRIT is a unique Registry-Randomized Clinical Trial (RRCT) that will test the hypothesis
      that spironolactone reduces all-cause mortality in HFPEF and is summarized by PICO (Patient
      Intervention Comparison Outcome) as follows: Population: HFPEF patients in the Swedish Heart
      Failure Registry. HFPEF defined as symptoms/signs of HF, elevated NTproBNP (B-type
      Natriuretic Peptide; N-terminal pro b-type Natriuretic Peptide) and EF&gt;=40%. Intervention
      and control: Randomized 1:1 to intervention: spironolactone + usual care vs. control: usual
      care alone.

      Outcome: Primary outcome all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include hospitalization for
      various causes, adverse events and treatment adherence. Outcomes are obtained automatically
      by linking with the Population, Patient and Drug Dispensed Registries. The trial is
      event-driven with enrollment 3 years and study duration 5 years. Based on actual patients
      meeting eligibility 2008-2010, the control death rate is 0.141 / year. Based on TOPCAT and
      accounting for dropouts, the investigators conservatively assume hazard ratio 0.85, or a
      clinically meaningful 15% reduction in death, yielding a required number of events of 1208
      and a sample size of 3335, conservatively rounded to 3500. A detailed feasibility assessment
      shows that there will be &gt; 8197 eligible patients to meet the required enrollment of 3500.
