      Two part, dose escalation and dose expansion study. Open label, multi center, non
      randomized, multiple dose, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of single agent
      PF-06747143 in sequential dose levels of adult patients with refractory or relapsed AML in
      order to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or
      maximally permitted dose (MPD) following by a 3 arm dose expansion with PF-06747143 in
      combination with standard of care chemotherapy in adult patients with AML.

      Patients will receive intravenous (IV) PF-06747143 as a weekly infusion (QW) in 28 day
      cycles at escalating doses. The proposed dosing scheme includes 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10, 15, and
      20 mg/kg. Patients will be monitored for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose escalation
      in order to define the MTD. Two of the three arms in the dose expansion will include
      PF-06747143 in combination with standard of care chemotherapy and will include a safety lead
      in. The third arm, pending clinical data, will be PF-06747143 as a single agent.
