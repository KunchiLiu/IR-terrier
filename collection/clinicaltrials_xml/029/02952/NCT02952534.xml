  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how patients with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer, and evidence of a homologous recombination gene deficiency, respond to
      treatment with rucaparib.

             differentiated carcinoma of the prostate

          -  Be surgically or medically castrated, with serum testosterone levels of â‰¤ 50 ng/dL
             (1.73 nM)

          -  Experienced disease progression after having received at least 1 but no more than 2
             prior next-generation androgen receptor-targeted therapies, and 1 prior taxane-based
             chemotherapy, for castration-resistant disease

          -  Have a deleterious mutation in BRCA1/2 or ATM, or molecular evidence of other
             homologous recombination deficiency

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active second malignancy, with the exception of curatively treated non-melanoma skin
             cancer, carcinoma in situ, or superficial bladder cancer
