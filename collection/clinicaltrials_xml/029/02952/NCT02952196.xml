  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addiction to amphetamine is characterized by alternating phases of intoxication and short
      abstinence, followed by recurrent drug-craving episodes which result in distress and
      relapse. Addiction involves a number of neurotransmission systems, including the
      endocannabinoid system (ECBS). Cannabidiol (CBD), the second most abundant component of
      cannabis, is known for its broad spectrum of physiological, anxiolytic and neuroprotective
      properties. It has been shown to have multiple therapeutic properties for treating anxiety,
      schizophrenia and interestingly CBD has been shown to be potentially helpful in treating
      addiction, due to its effects on various neuronal circuits involved in this disorder.

      The investigators overall hypothesis is that CBD is an interesting pharmacological contender
      to decrease amphetamine craving and treat amphetamine addiction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current DSM-V criteria for amphetamine use disorder

          -  Current amphetamine use with last use during two weeks prior to admission to the
             study

          -  Subject are not under treatment for amphetamine dependence at the time of the study

          -  Ability to give valid, informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe and/or unstable hepatic, neurologic (including diagnosis of seizures), cardiac
             (including arrhythmias) or renal disease, or any other severe or unstable medical

             medicinal products.

             anticonvulsants), or opioid medications (including methadone and suboxone) or
