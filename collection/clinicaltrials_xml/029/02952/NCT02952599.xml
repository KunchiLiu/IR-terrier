  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to current guidelines, duration of anticoagulant treatment after a venous
      thromboembolic event varies from 3 months to indefinite treatment depending on the estimated
      risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence and bleeding. Current data for edoxaban are
      limited to a maximum treatment duration of 12 months.

      Therefore, this study aims to gather further insight into efficacy (i.e. symptomatic
      recurrent VTE) and safety (i.e. bleeding events, liver adverse events, all-cause mortality
      and other drug related adverse events) of extended treatment with edoxaban up to 12 months
      in an unselected patient population in routine clinical practice.

      Edoxaban is an orally administered anticoagulant that inhibits coagulation factor Xa. It has
      been approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) in Korea (date: 25th, August
      2015) for the: Reduction in the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non
      valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
      embolism (PE) Reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, and by Taiwan Food and Drug
      Administration (TFDA) in Taiwan (date: 24th, February, 2016) for the Prevention of stroke
      and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors, such as
      congestive heart failure, hypertension, age â‰¥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or
      transient ischemic attack (TIA). Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
      embolism (PE) following 5 to 10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant.

      According to current guidelines, duration of anticoagulant treatment after a venous
      thromboembolic event varies from 3 months to indefinite treatment depending on the estimated
      risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence and bleeding. Current data for edoxaban are
      limited to a maximum treatment duration of 12 months.

      This non-interventional study aims to gather further insight into efficacy (i.e. symptomatic
      recurrent VTE) and safety (i.e. bleeding events, liver adverse events, all-cause mortality
      and other drug related adverse events) of extended treatment with edoxaban up to 12 months
      in approximately 350 patients in an unselected patient population in routine clinical
      practice.
