  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the dose-escalation part of the trial is to determine the safety and
      tolerability, Pharmacokinetic (PK), biomarkers, and efficacy, and to determine the Maximum
      Tolerated Dose and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of BI 754091 on the basis of
      patients with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in patients with selected advanced solid
      malignancies. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by monitoring the occurrence of
      adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAE), and laboratory parameter abnormalities, as well as
      changes to vital signs.

      Secondary objectives are the determination of the PK profile of BI 754091 after single and
      multiple doses of BI 754091, and the preliminary assessment of antitumour activity.

      In the dose-expansion part of the trial, the main objectives are to further assess the
      safety, efficacy, PK profile, and biomarkers of BI 754091 at the RP2D.
