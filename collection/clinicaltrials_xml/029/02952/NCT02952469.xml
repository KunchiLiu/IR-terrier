  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to collect initial data regarding biodistribution,
      reproducibility, and dosimetry for the radiotracer Ga-68 PSMA-HBED-CC, an agent which may be
      useful for the early detection of metastatic prostate cancer. Investigators will use a test
      and re-test design in all patients to determine reproducibility of lesion detection and
      signal intensity, and will include dynamic imaging in some patients for the purposes of
      dosimetry. Patients with known metastatic prostate cancer will be recruited and imaged on
      two occasions within the course of 15 days.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Male age &gt;/= 18 years

          -  Histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Multifocal metastatic disease in either castrate sensitive or castrate resistant
             patients.

          -  May or may not be on hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or radium therapy. If on
             hormonal therapy or chemotherapy, must be on it for at least 3 months.

          -  No plans to undergo PCa therapy administration (with hormone therapy, chemotherapy,
             radium therapy, external radiation) between the two study exams.

          -  At least 2 metastatic soft tissue or osseous lesions identified on conventional
             imaging (CT, MRI or bone scan).

          -  Karnofsky performance status of 50 or greater (or ECOG/WHO equivalent)

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection requiring hospitalization, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Physical limitation that would limit compliance with the study requirements

          -  Current enrollment in a therapeutic clinical trial
