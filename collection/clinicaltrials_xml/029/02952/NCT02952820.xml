  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The key objectives of this study are to determine, using sleep diaries, whether lemborexant
      at the doses 5 milligrams (mg) and 10 mg is superior to placebo on subjective sleep onset,
      subjective sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep maintenance in participants with insomnia
      disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term (approximately 1 year), multicenter, randomized, controlled,
      double-blind, parallel group study of two doses of lemborexant and placebo in approximately
      900 male or female participants with insomnia disorder. Approximately 40% of participants
      will be age 65 years or older. The study will last a maximum of 59 weeks, and will include a
      Screening Period, an approximately 54-week Treatment Period (during which study medication
      will be administered), and a 2-week Follow-up Period. All participants will receive
      lemborexant for at least 6 months and will receive placebo at some point during the study.
      Participants will not know which medication they receive (lemborexant or placebo), and will
      not know the timings at which the medication will change.

             during the night
