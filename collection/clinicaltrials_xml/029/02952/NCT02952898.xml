    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to compare the safety and effectiveness of GDC 695 (test
      drug) against the currently marketed reference drug (diclofenac sodium gel, 3%) and to
      establish that these two drugs work better than placebo in the treatment of actinic
      keratosis.
