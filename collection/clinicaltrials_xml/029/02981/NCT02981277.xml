  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flexible bronchoscopy is one of the most widely performed procedures for diagnosis of
      various bronchopulmonary diseases. Most patients tolerate the procedure well although cough
      is often reported as a distressing symptom. It is likely that the acceptance of bronchoscopy
      would be significantly improved with control of cough. Use of sedation during bronchoscopy
      has been reported to improve procedure tolerance. However, awake(no sedation) bronchoscopy
      is routinely performed at many centres including ours.

      Topical lignocaine is administered during bronchoscopy for local anaesthesia. There is
      limited literature on the efficacy of transtracheal/transcricoid injection versus spray as
      you go method for lignocaine delivery to the airways during bronchoscopy. This study would
      help to determine the procedure comfort for the patient while using the
      transtracheal/transcricoid method vs the spray as you go method.

      For all patients meeting the inclusion criteria, the demographic profile including age, sex,
      weight, smoking history and the type of procedures performed during bronchoscopy shall be
      recorded. A written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The patients
      who undergo flexible bronchoscopy would be randomised in a one is to one ratio either to
      transcricoid or spray as you go group. Prior to the bronchoscopy blood pressure, pulse rate,
      respiratory rate and pulse oximetry saturation will be recorded at the baseline Patients in
      both the groups shall be prepared in a similar fashion except for the initial route of
      lignocaine delivery.

      During the procedure, 2 ml aliquots of 1% lignocaine solution will be delivered through the
      bronchoscope when using spray-as-you go technique. Patients in the transcricoid group shall
      initially receive 5 ml of 2% lignocaine solution and additional aliquots of 1% lignocaine
      using the spray as you go method. The total lignocaine dose during the procedure will be
      recorded. The patients would be monitored for any adverse effects throughout the procedure.
      The bronchoscopist doing the procedure will be provided 2 VAS charts to mark the severity of
      cough and overall procedure satisfaction. An audio recorder shall be used to record the
      cough count during the entire procedure.

      Post procedure, patients will record the pain experienced while undergoing the procedure on
      the VAS scale.
