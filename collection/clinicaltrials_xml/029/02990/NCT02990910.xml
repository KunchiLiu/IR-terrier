  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high incidence of respiratory morbidity after adenotonsillectomy is reported in children
      with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). So we designed a prospective, double-blind,
      randomized controlled study to determine the effects of personalized opioid analgesia
      compared with conventional opioid analgesia on respiratory morbidity after
      adenotonsillectomy in Children with OSAS.

    <textblock>
      All children were randomized 2 groups based on a computer-generated random number. The main
      interventions were occurred in post anesthetic care unit (PACU). In the operating room, all
      patients received a standardized anesthetic regimen by one anesthetist. Sevoflurane was used
      for maintenance without any opioids. Before the end of the procedure, spontaneous
      respiratory was recovered. All the patients were given 1 mcg/kg fentanyl intravenous
      injection after the end of the procedure. The positive result was defined as spontaneous
      respiratory rate decreased more than 50%, the others were defined as negative result. The
      result of fentanyl test submitted to assistant, and prepared the rescue analgesic drugs
      according to this result. One group: positive result 10μg/kg morphine; negative result
      50μg/kg morphine. Another group: all received 25μg/kg morphine .The trachea was extubated
      when patients were awake, and then transported to the PACU. Patients with a Children's
      Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale score&gt;6 received rescue analgesic drugs and observe
      respiratory morbidity in each group.
