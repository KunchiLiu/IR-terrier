      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the benefit of isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and low-dose
      dexamethasone in the prolongation of Progression Free Survival (PFS) as compared to
      pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in patients with refractory or relapsed and
      refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the Overall Response Rate (ORR) as per International Myeloma Working Group
           (IMWG) criteria in each arm.

        -  To compare the Overall Survival (OS) between the two arms.

        -  To evaluate the Time To Progression (TTP) in each arm.

        -  To evaluate the Progression Free Survival (PFS) in high risk cytogenetic population in
           each arm.

        -  To evaluate the Duration of Response (DOR) in each arm.

        -  To evaluate the safety in both treatment arms.

        -  To determine the Pharmacokinetic profile of isatuximab in combination with
           pomalidomide.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab.

        -  To assess disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life (HRQL), disease
           and treatment-related symptoms, health state utility, and health status.

      The duration of the study for the patients will include a period for screening of up to 3
      weeks. Patients will continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
      adverse reaction, patients' wish or other reason of discontinuation.

      During follow-up, patients who discontinue the study treatment due to progression of the
      disease will be followed every 3 months (12 weeks) for survival (or until cut- off date),
      and patients who discontinue the study treatment prior to documentation of disease
      progression will be followed-up every 4 weeks until disease progression, and then every 3
      months (12 weeks) for survival (or until cut-off date).
