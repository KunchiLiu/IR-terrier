    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, Phase 2, dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), and efficacy of venetoclax administered in combination with azacitidine in
      participants with treatment-naïve higher-risk (HR) MDS as compared to azacitidine
      monotherapy.
