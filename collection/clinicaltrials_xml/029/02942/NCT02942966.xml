      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-blinded study designed to investigate
      the safety and efficacy of the Tack Endovascular System in the Mid/Distal Popliteal, Tibial,
      and Peroneal Arteries ranging in diameter from 1.5mm to 4.5mm for the treatment of post
      percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) dissection(s) requiring repair.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or non-pregnant females ≥ 18 years of age at the time of consent

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior
             to treatment and must use some form of contraception (abstinence is acceptable)
             through the duration of the study

          -  Subject has been informed of and understands the nature of the study and provides
             signed informed consent to participate in the study. If the subject possesses the
             ability to understand and provide informed consent but due to physical inability, the
             subject cannot sign the informed consent form (ICF), an impartial witness may sign on
             behalf of the subject

          -  Willing to comply with all required follow-up visits

          -  Rutherford Classification 3, 4 or 5. Rutherford 5 subjects may not exceed the
             following WIfI scores: Wound 0, 1 or modified 2, Ischemia 0-3, Infection 0-1. To
             further specify, the &quot;modified 2&quot; Wound Grade permits a deeper ulcer without exposed
             bone, joint or tendon; or shallow or superficial heel ulcer, without deep tissue
             involvement or exposed calcaneus. It also permits gangrenous changes limited to
             digits.

          -  Estimated life expectancy ≥1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is pregnant or refuses to use contraception through the duration of the study

          -  Acute limb ischemia, defined as symptom onset occurring less than 14 days prior to
             the index procedure

          -  Prior or planned above-ankle amputation to the target limb, including transmetatarsal
             amputation and full thickness heel gangrene (this does not apply to digital
             amputations or ulcer debridements)

          -  Infection that exceeds WIfI grade 0 or 1. This includes any systemic infection or
             immunocompromised state. Patients with an ascending infection/deep foot infection or
             abscess/white blood count (WBC)≥12,000/or febrile state are excluded from
             participation

          -  Endovascular or surgical procedure (not including diagnostic procedures or planned
             digit amputation/wound debridement) to the target limb less than 30 days prior to or
             planned for less than 30 days after the index procedure

          -  Existing stent implant in the target vessel and/or in-stent restenosis of target
             lesion

          -  Endovascular or surgical procedure (not including diagnostic procedures) to the
             non-target limb less than 14 days prior to the index procedure or planned procedure
             less than 30 days after the index procedure

          -  Any other endovascular or surgical procedure (not including diagnostic procedures)
             less than 14 days prior to the index procedure or planned procedure less than 30 days
             after the index procedure

          -  Use of atherectomy, cryoplasty, cutting/scoring/contoured balloon angioplasty,
             stenting or any other treatment (with the exception of a crossing device) of the
             target lesion other than plain balloon angioplasty PTA during the index procedure

          -  Known coagulopathy, hypercoagulable state, bleeding diathesis, other blood disorder,
             or a platelet count less than 80,000/microliter or greater than 500,000/microliter

          -  Wound(s) that exceed WIfI grade 0, 1, or Modified 2. The &quot;Modified 2&quot; grade permits a
             deeper ulcer without exposed bone, joint or tendon; or shallow or superficial heel
             ulcer, without deep tissue involvement or exposed calcaneus. It also permits
             gangrenous changes limited to digits.

          -  Any subject in which antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic therapy is
             contraindicated

          -  Myocardial infarction, thrombolysis or angina less than 30 days prior to the Index
             Procedure

          -  History of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) less than 90 days prior to the
             Index Procedure

          -  Currently on dialysis

          -  Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to nickel-titanium alloy (Nitinol)

          -  Participating in another ongoing investigational clinical trial that has not
             completed its primary endpoint

          -  Has other comorbidities that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude them
             from receiving this treatment and/or participating in study-required follow-up
             assessments

          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to contrast agents that cannot be medically managed
