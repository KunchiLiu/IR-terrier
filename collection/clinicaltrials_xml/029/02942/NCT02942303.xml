  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe three safe and reproducible techniques for brow
      lifting using botulinum toxin. It will also describe the effect of the three techniques on
      the eyebrow shape using quantitative, objective measurements and subjective scales.

    <description>Objective assessment will be done on anteroposterior views of pre-and-post injection photographs. The mid pupillary line will be drawn and the eyebrow vertical height will be measured from this line to the upper border of the brow at seven horizontal points: the most medial aspect of the eyebrow, medial canthus, medial limbus, mid pupil, lateral limbus, lateral sclera, and most lateral eyebrow.</description>

    <measure>Investigators Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in Overall appearance of the upper face, as assessed by the 3 investigators (2 plastic surgeons and 1 dermatologist) using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). GAIS will be completed based on photographic assessment comparing post-treatment photos taken at day 15 post intervention to baseline photos (the lower eyelids and lower face will be cropped), to assess overall aesthetic improvement. The GAIS is a 5-point scale (1-5) as follows:
Very Much Improved: optimal cosmetic results
Much Improved: marked improvement in appearance from initial condition but not completely optimal
Improved: obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition but additional treatments are advised
No Change: the appearance is the same as the original condition
Worse: the appearance is worse from the original condition</description>

    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be determined by a questionnaire completed at 15 days post-treatment. Subjects will indicate how satisfied they are on a 4-point scale (1-4) as follow:
Very Satisfied
Satisfied
Dissatisfied
Very Dissatisfied.</description>

    <measure>Brow Positioning Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Brow Positioning Scale: subjective evaluation using a photonumeric validated scale for eye brow positioning (evaluated by 2 plastic surgeons and 1 dermatologist) using pre and post injection photographs (taken at day 15) as follow:
0-Youthful, refreshed look and high-arch eyebrow
Medium-arch eyebrow
Slight arch of the eyebrow
Flat arch of the eyebrow, visibility of folds, and tired appearance
Flat eyebrow with barely any arch, marked visibility of folds, and very tired appearance.</description>
