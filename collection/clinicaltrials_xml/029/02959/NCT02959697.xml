  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blepharoptosis (ptosis) repair is a common and generally well tolerated surgical procedure
      usually performed using local anesthetic. However, a subset of patients appears to
      experience intraoperative pain/discomfort during ptosis repair using an anterior approach
      with subcutaneous local anesthetic. Posterior subconjuctival local anesthetic is currently
      used for eyelid procedures such as chalazion incision and drainage and full-thickness eyelid
      resections. The purpose of this study is to determine whether an additional subconjunctival
      injection of local anesthetic, through the posterior aspect of the eyelid, reduces
      intraoperative pain during anterior ptosis repair.

    <measure>Presence of post-operative lagophthalmos/fluorescein staining</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The presence or absence of lagophthalmos and fluorescein staining will be assessed in each eye at the post-operative follow up appointment, and will be compared with McNemar's test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Operative margin-reflex distance 1</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative margin-reflex distance 1 (MDR1 - distance between the pupillary light reflex and the lower edge of the upper lid) will be measured in each eye. The difference between the MDR1 of each eye will be analyzed using paired Student's T-testing.</description>
