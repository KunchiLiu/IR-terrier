    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention with a
      mobile adherence platform, compared to physician- or nurse-guided standard of care, to
      improve medication adherence to rivaroxaban in participants who have recently initiated
      treatment with rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation based on an
      assessment of the proportion of days covered (PDC) of rivaroxaban treatment.

    <description>Adherence to rivaroxaban medication will be estimated based on validated PDC algorithm.

             for concomitant conditions are allowed as long as 1 of the indications is atrial
             fibrillation)

          -  Current use of: specialized anticoagulation clinics for rivaroxaban medication
             management; specialized pharmacist-led adherence or refill monitoring; or enrollment
