    <textblock>
      The OPTIMUM registry is a minimal risk observational study that uses a prospective cohort
      design to follow patients who have multivessel or left main coronary artery disease
      (&quot;surgical anatomy&quot; according to ACC/AHA Appropriateness Criteria for PCI12) and are deemed
      ineligible for coronary artery bypass surgery. It is anticipated that 20 sites will be
      selected to participate in the registry from a national network of leading centers across
      the United States with recognized expertise in both complex PCI and coronary artery bypass
      surgery. We will invite leading cardiac centers, as defined by US News and World reports
      rankings for heart care. Additional sites may be added to meet the target enrollment goal.

      Objectives 1. Compare 30-day mortality and the composite of mortality and morbidity
      following high-risk percutaneous coronary revascularization with predicted Society of
      Thoracic Surgeons (STS) survival and morbidity in patients with severe multivessel or left
      main coronary artery disease (CAD).

      2. Compare the 12-month health status and clinical outcomes of surgically ineligible
      multivessel or left main CAD patients treated with PCI compared to those treated with a
      medical therapy alone.

      3. Understand the association between completeness of revascularization and long-term health
      status and clinical outcomes among patients with multivessel or left main CAD treated with
      PCI deemed ineligible for surgery.

      4. Compare 6-month and 1-year survival among surgically ineligible high-risk PCI patients
      with predicted STS survival (ASCERT risk model)

      5. Determine the justification for surgical ineligibility by cardiologists and cardiac
      surgeons among patients with severe multivessel or left main coronary artery disease (CAD).

      6. Describe the frequency and predictors of PCI versus medical management among surgically
      ineligible patients with severe multivessel or left main CAD.

      7. Describe the frequency and predictors of complete revascularization in this population.

      8. Describe the costs and costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained of the strategy
      of management of multivessel or left main CAD with PCI versus medical therapy among
      surgically ineligible patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Participant Selection Inclusion Criteria

          1. Participant undergoes coronary angiography revealing unprotected left main stenosis
             of &gt; 50%, 3 vessel disease with stenoses &gt; 70% or 2 vessel coronary disease (&gt;70%)
             with one lesion involving the proximal LAD. Patients will also be included if there
             is FFR evidence of flow limiting stenosis (FFR ≤ 0.80) in the setting of &gt; 40%
             angiographic stenosis the left main, 3 epicardial coronaries or 2 vessels including
             the proximal LAD. Patients with prior bypass surgery will be included if they have ≥
             2 epicardial vascular distributions subtended by a severe native coronary stenosis
             with either no bypass graft supplying the vessel, a severely diseased (&gt;70% stenosis)
