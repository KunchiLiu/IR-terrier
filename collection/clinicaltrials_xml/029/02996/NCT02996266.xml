    <textblock>
      This study will assess the impact of fever prevention on fever burden and short- and
      long-term neurologic outcomes in brain injured patients. Half of the subjects will undergo
      fever prevention using a targeted temperature management system and half of the subjects
      will be treated for fever should it develop.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies demonstrate that fever / elevated temperature is associated with poor
      outcomes in brain injured patients; however, there are no conclusive studies that
      demonstrate that fever prevention/controlled normothermia is associated with better
      outcomes. This study will be conducted to assess the impact of advanced temperature control
      to prevent fever in brain injured patients. The fever prevention group will use the Arctic
      Sun Temperature Management System and will be compared to standard care patients in whom
      fever may spontaneously develop. If fever develops in a patient in the standard care group,
      they will be treated with standard fever care measures according to a step-wise algorithm,
      consisting primarily of intermittent antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) and cooling blankets
      and, when necessary, advanced targeted temperature management devices.

          9. Has poor skin integrity or poor tissue perfusion
