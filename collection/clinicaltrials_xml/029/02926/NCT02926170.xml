  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term anticoagulation is widely used for secondary thromboprophylaxis in the
      antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) due to the high risk of recurrent events. Currently
      anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is the standard of care but have
      unpredictable pharmacodynamic properties that requiere monitoring for dose adjustment.
      Rivaroxaban, an orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor, has been shown to be effective and
      safe compared with warfarin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and non valvular
      atrial fibrillation in major RCTs. No studies had been published in APS.The aim of the study
      is to investigate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in preventing recurrent thrombosis
      in patients with APS compared with acenocumarol

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3 randomized, multicenter, non-inferiority open-label RCT. 190 eligible APS
      patients with arterial or venous thrombotic history receiving acenocumarol will be
      stratified according the presence of SLE and venous/arterial thrombotic history and
      randomized (1:1) either to continue vitamin K antagonists (standard of care, normalized
      ratio (INR) 2-3 or 2.5 to 3.5 in those with recurrent thrombotic episodes) or to switch to
      rivaroxaban (20 mg/day). The primary efficacy outcome is the development of any thrombotic
      event during the study period. Secondary efficacy outcomes include time to thrombosis, type
      of thrombosis (arterial or venous), overall causes of death, evaluation of a prognostic
      biomarker panel of recurrent thrombosis. The primary safety outcome will be major bleeding.
      Secondary safety outcomes include any adverse event and minor bleeding.
