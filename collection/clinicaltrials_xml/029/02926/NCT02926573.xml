      The study will involve adult otolaryngology patients over the age of 18 years undergoing
      open or endoscopic/robotic tumor resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the oral
      cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx at Washington University Medical Center. Eligible
      patients will be recruited from the otolaryngology head and neck cancer clinic during
      preoperative visits. Participants will be randomized to active or placebo drug and will
      receive study drug twice a day from Post-Op Day 0 and conclude Post-Op Day 2. Questionnaires
      will be collected pre-and post-operatively.

    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction with healthcare is increasingly being utilized as a metric to reflect
      provider and hospital quality of care. Furthermore, at the core of a healthcare team and
      healthcare system is the desire to provide patients with the best possible care in order to
      achieve the best possible outcomes. We as providers have the duty to identify areas of
      needed improvement within our domains of treatment. An area of need that is ubiquitous
      within medicine is pain control; in this case acute postoperative pain control is the
      targeted condition. Studies have already shown that better control of acute postoperative
      pain leads to shortened hospital stays, reduced hospital costs and patient morbidity,
      improved patient satisfaction and a reduced likelihood of developing chronic pain. Research
      within the field of pain management has definitively revealed that a combination of
      different medication regimens can control acute postoperative pain better than narcotics
      alone. In particular, the medication gabapentin has been shown to improve acute postop pain
      in many kinds of surgical settings, and it is a safe medication with arguably fewer side
      effects than narcotics. We know that certain groups of post surgical otolaryngology patients
      can be at risk for high levels of postoperative pain. Given all of this information,
      physicians have a responsibility to utilize medications such as gabapentin to do a better
      job of controlling our patient's pain. This investigation is a quality improvement project
      designed to elucidate the benefits of gabapentin in pain management in patients undergoing
      surgery of the head and neck mucosal surfaces. It will provide much needed data in an
      understudied population and ultimately will improve the practice of pain management, patient
      satisfaction and quality of care delivered in the Barnes otolaryngology department.
