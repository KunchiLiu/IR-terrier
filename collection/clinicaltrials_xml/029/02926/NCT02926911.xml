  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the risks and benefits of active surveillance (AS) compared to guideline
      concordant care (GCC) in the setting of a pragmatic prospective randomized trial for low
      risk DCIS. Our overarching hypothesis is that management of low-risk Ductal Carcinoma in
      Situ (DCIS) using an AS approach does not yield inferior cancer or quality of life outcomes
      compared to GCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overdiagnosis and overtreatment resulting from mammographic screening have been estimated to
      be as high as 1 in 4 patients diagnosed with breast cancer although the absence of standard
      definitions for measuring overdiagnosis has led to much uncertainty around this estimate.
      The national health care expenditure resulting from false positive mammograms and breast
      cancer overdiagnosis has been estimated to approach $4 billion annually. There is general
      consensus that much of this burden derives from the treatment of DCIS; for those estimated
      40,000 women per year whose DCIS may never have progressed even without treatment, medical
      intervention can only harm. In those women who undergo surgical management of DCIS, there is
      risk of developing persistent pain at the surgical site, with estimates ranging from 25-68%.
      Importantly, persistent pain after lumpectomy may be as prevalent as that after total
      mastectomy. Persistent postsurgical pain is rated by patients as the most troubling symptom,
      leading to disability and psychological distress, and is often resistant to management.
      Although prospective population-based data have demonstrated significant patient and
      surgical focus on pain with remarkably high levels of chronic pain 4 and 9 months after
      breast surgery, much of these data have been collected in women with invasive cancer, with
      little data directly relevant to patients with DCIS.

      The overarching hypothesis of the study is that management of low-risk DCIS using an active
      surveillance (AS) approach does not yield inferior cancer or quality of life outcomes
      compared to guideline concordant care (GCC).
