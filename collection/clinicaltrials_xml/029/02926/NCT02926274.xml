    <textblock>
      Massive hemorrhage is a major cause of potentially preventable death following trauma. A
      common consequence of hemorrhagic shock is uncontrollable bleeding from coagulopathy,
      leading to death from exsanguination. Even when bleeding is controlled, patients are at
      increased risk of complications and mortality. Reconstituted whole blood, or component
      therapy with packed red blood cells (PRBCs), plasma, and platelets was introduced by the
      military in recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan with remarkable results and has been
      adopted by most civilian trauma centers. Despite improving coagulopathy, it is apparent that
      transfusion of blood components is not equivalent to whole blood transfusion. Transfusion of
      high plasma volumes may be associated with increased risk of allergic reaction, transfusion
      associated acute lung injury (TRALI), hypervolemic cardiac failure, and acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS). Military services have recently reintroduced fresh whole blood
      (FWB) for standard resuscitation of massive hemorrhage, have found that FWB offers a
      survival advantage over component therapy, and that risks of transfusion reactions are
      similar for FWB and PRBCs. On the civilian side, whole blood is an FDA-licensed product that
      has been in use in pediatric open heart surgery and autologous blood donation but is no
      longer commonly available for other indications. However, the military results are renewing
      interest in whole blood for trauma resuscitation. The use of low-antibody titer whole blood
      leukoreduced with a platelet-sparing filter was recently approved by the University of
      California Los Angeles Blood and Blood Derivatives Committee and two other trauma centers
      for male trauma patients. This study will test the feasibility of providing FWB for
      resuscitation of patients in hemorrhagic shock and determine the effects of FWB on clinical
      outcomes as well as the effects on coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation, compared to
      standard blood component therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most current massive transfusion protocols attempt to treat the early coagulopathic state
      induced by severe injury and hemorrhagic shock with transfusion of red blood cells, plasma,
      and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio replicating whole blood. Civilian trauma centers have now
      begun to initiate resuscitation of adult male patients with stored whole blood as a standard
      of care, however.

      The main hypothesis behind this change in practice is that transfusion of fresh whole blood
      (FWB) rather than attempted reconstitution from its banked components is safer, more
      efficient and effective treatment of hemorrhagic shock following injury and will result in
      less frequent development of clinical coagulopathy and subsequent mortality. Whole blood
      offers the advantages of more precisely approximating shed blood; decreased volume of
      additives per unit; and exposure to a decreased number of donors for a patient undergoing
      massive transfusion. It remains to be seen whether this will translate into differences in
      coagulopathy, inflammation, and mortality. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      feasibility of developing a system to collect, store, and deliver whole blood for trauma
      resuscitations in a civilian trauma center.

      The universal donor blood type for patients with unknown blood type is type O positive blood
      for males and O negative for females. Because O negative blood is rare the study will
      initiate the change in practice in adult male patients and later extend it to female
      patients if feasible. The study will determine the effects of FWB transfusion in adult male
      patients compared to transfusion of PRBCS, plasma, and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio in non
      adult male patients on markers of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation, as well as
      the development of complications and hospital mortality following severe injury.

      Specific aims are to:

        1. Determine the appropriate shelf life of FWB that has been leukoreduced with a platelet
           sparing filter by measuring changes in levels of coagulation factors and global
           clotting potential of banked units over time. To accomplish this the investigators will
           measure variables known to reflect potential and actual clotting capacity including
           platelet function and overall clotting ability by thromboelastography (TEG) and
           thrombin generation analysis in whole blood up to 35 days.

        2. Prospectively determine the effectiveness of trauma resuscitation using FWB compared to
           component therapy and its effects on variables known to reflect potential and actual
           clotting capacity including markers of coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammation,
           platelet function and global hemostatic potential post transfusion, as well as hospital
           outcomes including development of coagulopathy, infection, venous thromboembolism
           (VTE), multiple organ failure (MOF), total transfusion requirements, and mortality.

        3. Test the feasibility and implementation of a system to provide FWB for resuscitation of
           trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock in civilian trauma centers. This will be
           accomplished by monitoring cost, storage needs, frequency of blood collection, number
           of donors, inventory, utilization and wastage of unused units.
