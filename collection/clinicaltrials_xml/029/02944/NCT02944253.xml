  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two dietary approaches, very low energy diets (VLEDs) and ketogenic low carbohydrate diets
      (KLCDs), have the ability to suppress appetite. The suppression of appetite typically
      observed during these diets is believed (but not clinically proven) to be due to ketosis, a
      condition where circulating concentrations of ketone bodies are increased due to a higher
      production of ketones in the liver. Little is known about the potential mechanisms through
      which ketosis may lead to appetite suppression in VLEDs and KLCDs. A 'ketogenic diet'
      typically contains less than 50 grams carbohydrate per day, yet ketosis has been seen in
      subjects who consume diets with a carbohydrates ranging between 59-192 grams per day.
      Although an association between ketosis and appetite suppression has been established, the
      minimum level of ketosis and maximum carbohydrate intake that is still associated with
      appetite suppression remains unknown and should be explored. The ability to increase
      carbohydrate intake while maintaining a suppressed appetite will allow dieters to consume
      more carbohydrate-rich food that is beneficial for health without feeling more hungry. The
      aim of this study is, therefore, to identify the maximum carbohydrate intake that is still
      associated with appetite suppression in a low energy diet and to determine the impact of a
      higher carbohydrate intake on appetite suppression, body composition, and resting metabolic
      rate.
