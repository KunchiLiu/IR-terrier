    <textblock>
      The addition of a self-rehabilitation program to repeated Botulinum Toxin Injections and
      usual physiotherapy should increase the proportion of patients who attain their Primary
      Treatment Goal (impairments and function) more than usual care (involving repeated Botulinum
      Toxin Injections and conventional physiotherapy), in post stroke out-patients with
      spasticity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke affects 150 000 persons in France each year. Most patients have activity limitations
      because of the resulting motor deficit and spasticity. Autonomy in activities of daily
      living is reduced.

      The principal treatment for focal spasticity is currently intramuscular botulinum toxin
      injection ( Botulinum Toxin Injections).

      Botulinum Toxin Injections is classically combined with only 2 to 3 sessions of out-patient
      physiotherapy per week. This is mainly because of a lack of out-patient therapists. However,
      this amount of therapy is insufficient and does not follow current literature which shows
      that the intensity of physiotherapy affects the recovery of impairment and activity. This
      gap in our health system could be filled by a self-rehabilitation program in addition to
      physiotherapy.

      Recent studies have shown that self-rehabilitation following Botulinum Toxin Injections
      could significantly improve activity limitation.

      The addition of a self-rehabilitation program to Botulinum Toxin Injections and usual
      out-patient physiotherapy could thus increase the effects of Botulinum Toxin Injections on
      impairment and activity limitation in patients with spastic hemiparesis following stroke.
