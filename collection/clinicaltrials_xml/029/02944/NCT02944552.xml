      The test adopted the superiority design of multi center, randomized, double-blind, positive
      control drug, dose finding, using two simulation skills. The qualified subjects, according
      to the ratio of 1:1:1, were randomized into low dose group and high dose group and positive
      drug control group, and received a treatment course of 8 weeks, all individuals were
      followed up for 4 weeks after drug withdrawal.

             RUCAM causality scale score more than or equal to 6 points. If the evaluation of
             RUCAM causality scale score is 3~5,the DILI patient needs three liver disease experts
             to confirm, and the opinion of the three liver specialists are consensus

          3. The serum ALT is between 3and 8 times ULN, but TBiL is less than or equal to 2 times
             ULN

          4. Liver biochemical abnormalities lasted less than 90 days

          5. Patients can understand after they know the nature of the experiment, the nature of
             the disease, the characteristics of drugs, related treatment methods and the risk
             they may need to bear if they participate in the test, and sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other reasons cause liver damage, such as viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease,
             and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and autoimmune liver disease.

          4. Serious heart, lung, brain, kidney, gastrointestinal and systemic diseases.

          5. At the same time taking the drugs that affect observation of curative effect of this
             experiment.

          6. The drug allergy or intolerance
