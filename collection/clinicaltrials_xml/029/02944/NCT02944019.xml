    <textblock>
      In order to understand the risks and benefits of edoxaban use in a real-world clinical
      setting in the Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) indication, Daiichi-Sankyo proposed
      this post-authorization safety study (PASS) to gain insight into the safety (bleeding, liver
      adverse events, all-cause mortality and other drug related adverse events) of edoxaban use
      in patients with NVAF who were not preselected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be from 12 different European countries and care settings (primary and
      secondary care and different specialties). A one-year patient recruitment period per country
      is planned, but it could be longer if patient recruitment numbers are not reached. Patient
      data will be documented at baseline (BL), one annual data documentation point during the
      four-year follow up (FU), and at final assessment. Patients who permanently discontinue
      edoxaban during the observation period will continue to be followed annually for a further
      two years, or until the end of the observational period (whichever comes first).
