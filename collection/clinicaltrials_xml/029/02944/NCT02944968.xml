  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the workflow and acute performance , during
      standard electrophysiology mapping and RF ablation procedures, of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH®
      SF-5D catheter with temperature sensing capabilities and micro electrodes used in
      combination with the CARTO® 3 Navigation System with THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF-5D-module.
