      This study is a randomized controlled trial of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove and fuel
      distribution in 3,200 households in four countries (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda).
      Following a common protocol, each intervention site will recruit 800 pregnant women (aged
      18-34 years, &lt;20 weeks gestation), and will randomly assign half their households to receive
      LPG stoves and a 30-month supply of LPG. Controls will receive the same cookstoves and LPG
      supply at the end of the study. The mother will be followed along with her child until the
      child is 2 years old. The researchers estimate that 25% of households will have a second,
      non-pregnant older adult woman (aged 35-64 years) who will also be enrolled at baseline and
      followed during the 30-month follow-up period. To optimize intervention use, the researchers
      will implement behavior change strategies informed by previous experiences and formative
      research in Year 1. This study will assess cookstove use, conduct repeated personal exposure
      assessments of household air pollution, and collect dried blood spots and urinary samples
      for biomarker analysis and biospecimen storage. The primary outcomes are low birthweight,
      pneumonia incidence, and linear growth in the child, and blood pressure in the older adult
      woman. Secondary outcomes include preterm birth and gross motor development in the child,
      maternal blood pressure during pregnancy, and endothelial function, respiratory impairment,
      carcinogenic metabolites, and quality of life in the older adult woman.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, nearly 3 billion people rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating, the vast
      majority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The resulting household air pollution
      (HAP) is the third leading risk factor in the 2010 global burden of disease, accounting for
      an estimated 4.3 million deaths annually, largely among women and young children. Previous
      interventions have provided cleaner biomass-based cookstoves, but have failed to reduce
      exposure to levels that produce meaningful health improvements. There have been no
      large-scale field trials with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cookstoves, likely the cleanest
      scalable intervention.

      The aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of LPG stove and fuel
      distribution in 3,200 households in four LMICs (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda) to
      deliver rigorous evidence regarding potential health benefits across the lifespan. Each
      intervention site will recruit 800 pregnant women (aged 18-34 years, &lt;20 weeks gestation),
      and will randomly assign half their households to receive LPG stoves and a 30-month supply
      of LPG. Controls will receive the same cookstoves and LPG supply at the end of the study.
      The mother will be followed along with her child until the child is 2 years old. In
      households with a second, non-pregnant older adult woman (aged 35-64 years) the researchers
      will also enroll and follow her during the 30-month follow-up period in order to assess
      cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and cancer outcomes. To optimize intervention use, the
      researchers will implement behavior change strategies. This study will assess cookstove use,
      conduct repeated personal exposure assessments to HAP (PM2.5, black carbon, carbon
      monoxide), and collect dried blood spots and urinary samples for biomarker analysis and
      biospecimen storage on all participants at multiple time points. The primary outcomes are
      low birth weight, pneumonia incidence, and linear growth in the child, and blood pressure in
      the older adult woman. Secondary outcomes include preterm birth and gross motor development
      in the child, maternal blood pressure during pregnancy, and endothelial function,
      respiratory impairment, carcinogenic metabolites, and quality of life in the older adult
      woman.

      This study will address the following specific aims: (1) using an intent-to-treat analysis,
      determine the effect of a randomized LPG stove and fuel intervention on health in four
      diverse LMIC populations using a common protocol; (2) determine the exposure-response
      relationships for HAP and health; and (3) determine relationships between LPG intervention
      and both targeted and exploratory biomarkers of exposure/health effects.

      This study will provide compelling evidence, including costs and implementation strategies,
      to inform national and global policies on scaling up LPG stoves among vulnerable
      populations. Ultimately, this will facilitate deeper policy-level discussions as well as
      identify requirements for initiating and sustaining HAP interventions globally.

    <measure>Incidence of Pneumonia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months after birth</time_frame>
    <description>The number of times that a child has pneumonia during the first two years of life will be assessed. Active surveillance for acute lower respiratory infections in infants will be conducted at home visits at 24 hours, and weekly until the child reaches 24 months of age. Health workers will be trained to recognized influenza-like illness (cough or sore throat, and fever &gt;38Â°C) and danger signs of pneumonia using Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) definitions. Infants with severe acute lower respiratory infections (hypoxemia measured by portable pulse oximeter or with chest indrawing or stridor) will be referred for pulmonary ultrasound, and also referred to standard medical care.</description>

Abnormal fetal growth will be defined as an estimated fetal weight of less than the 10th percentile for gestational age based on the recently completed international standard for fetal growth (INTERGROWTH-21st) produced by the World Health Organization (WHO).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preterm birth</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 months (within 24 hours of birth, 3-5 months post randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>Preterm birth is defined as delivery of a living infant prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gross motor development</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month of age to 24 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>World Health Organization (WHO) Motor Milestones will be assessed quarterly (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of age). Six milestones will be assessed under direct observation by trained fieldworkers: sitting without support, hands-and-knees crawling, standing with assistance, walking with assistance, standing alone and walking alone. Starting at the 3-month visit, mothers will be asked to independently record ages of achievement that will occur at intervals between the quarterly assessments. The following observed performance will be recorded: a) tried but failed to perform the milestone, b) refused to perform despite being alert and calm, c) was able to perform the milestone and, d) could not be tested because of irritability, drowsiness or sickness. Percentiles and means (in days and months) for achieving each milestone will be calculated and compared to the reference standards developed by the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brachial artery reactivity testing (BART)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Brachial artery reactivity testing (BART) measures endothelial function via flow-mediated dilatation to reactive hyperemia following the release of arm blood-flow occlusion. In this test, baseline artery diameter is measured, then a blood pressure cuff is inflated to induce distal arm ischemia for 5 minutes and after releasing the pressure, the post-occlusion brachial artery diameter is measured. The ratio of post- to pre-occlusion artery diameter represents endothelial function where lower values indicate worse endothelial function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The carotid intima-media thickness test (CIMT) is used to determine the extent of carotid atherosclerotic vascular disease. The test measures the thickness of the inner two layers of the carotid artery and can detect plaque build up prior to physical symptoms being experienced. The carotid ultrasound will be performed with a portable ultrasound by trained sonographers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adult respiratory health and well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) measures impaired health and perceived well-being among individuals with chronic airway disease. The SGRQ has sections assessing symptoms, activities that cause breathlessness or are limited because of breathlessness, and the impacts of respiratory problems on employment, sense of control of health, panic, stigmatization, medication use, side effects of therapies, expectations for health and disturbances of daily life. The questionnaire includes multiple choice, true/false and open-ended questions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
