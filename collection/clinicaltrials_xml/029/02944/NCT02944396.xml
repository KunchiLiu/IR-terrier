    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of veliparib in
      combination with nivolumab and platinum doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel or
      carboplatin/pemetrexed) (Phase 1 portion) and to assess whether the addition of nivolumab to
      veliparib in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy results will improve progression
      free survival (PFS) compared to veliparib with platinum doublet chemotherapy alone in
      participants with metastatic or advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (Phase 2
      portion).

             inhibitor.

             protein-1 (anti-PD-1), or PD Ligand-1 (PD-L1) or PD Ligand-2 (PD-L2) agent or an
             antibody targeting other immunoregulatory receptors or mechanisms.

          -  Participant has received radiation therapy to lung greater than 30 Gy within 6

             days, or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy within 7 days, or palliative radiation
             within 7 days of the first dose of study medication.
