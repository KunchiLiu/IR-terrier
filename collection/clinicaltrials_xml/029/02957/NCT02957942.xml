  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focal dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by excessive involuntary
      muscle contractions of any body part. Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is a type of focal dystonia
      characterized by excessive contraction of intrinsic muscles in the larynx, leading to
      difficulty in speaking and affecting effective communication. The cause of SD is unknown and
      there are no treatments that produce long-term benefits. Previous studies have suggested
      that SD and other focal dystonias are associated with decreased inhibition in sensorimotor
      areas in the brain. However, no studies have investigated the effects of modulating
      excitability of the laryngeal motor cortex in healthy individuals or SD. The goal of this
      pilot project is to determine if brain excitability of the laryngeal motor cortex can be
      changed with low-frequency inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in
      individuals with SD and healthy controls. Considering that rTMS at low frequencies (â‰¤1 Hz)
      produces lasting inhibition in the brain, and that SD is associated with decreased cortical
      inhibition, the purpose of this pilot study is to determine safety, feasibility and response
      to 1Hz rTMS to the laryngeal motor cortex in individuals with SD and healthy people. The
      results will help understand changes associated with the disorder, as well as contribute to
      the development of future clinical interventions for SD.

    <description>The change from baseline in CSP duration will be reported. The CSP is an interruption of voluntary muscle contraction after single pulse transcranial stimulation. The duration of the period of silent muscle activity will be measured to test the effects of rTMS intervention. There is no known clinical relevance for this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>Changes from baseline in the number of voice breaks during speech will be reported. Voice breaks will be measured by asking subjects to repeat 10 sentences. The frequency of voice breaks in the recorded 10 sentences will be counted.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary inclusion for spasmodic dysphonia:
