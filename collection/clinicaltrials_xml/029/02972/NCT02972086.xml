  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is development of the Integrative Pediatric FPA ADHD Care (IPFAC)
      Model. The IPFAC is intended to increase access to evidence-based behavioral parent training
      (BPT) for school-age children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD)
      who are diagnosed with ADHD and served in the ADHD Clinic at NYU Bellevue's Department of
      Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics.

      The specific aims of this study are to: 1) Develop the IPFAC model (Phase I); 2) Assess and
      determine facilitators and barriers to fidelity, assess feasibility of data acquisition,
      determine preliminary efficacy, and refine the IPFAC model through a small-scale
      implementation study and Plan-Do-Study-Act methods (Phase II), and, 3) Evaluate the revised
      IPFAC model in a small-scale study using state-of-the-art single-case study design
      methods/analyses to test &quot;treatment mechanisms&quot; in a sample of newly diagnosed youth with
      ADHD (Phase III) and finalize the IPFAC procedural manual.

    <measure>Parenting Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Alabama Parenting Questionnaire- Short Form (APQ-SF) is a well-validated 9-item measure of parenting style. Items are rated by the parent scored based on frequency of parenting behavior from Never (1), Almost Never (2), Sometimes (3), Often (4), Always (5). APQ-SF items are based around the three main structures: positive parenting, inconsistent discipline and poor supervision.</description>

    <description>The IOWA-CRS (Waschbusch &amp; Willoughby, 2008) is a widely used brief measure of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional-defiant behavior in children completed by parents. The IOWA-CRS consists of 10 items evaluated using a four-point Likert scale with the following anchors: not at all (0); just a little (1); pretty much (2); and very much (3).</description>

    <measure>Parental Depressive Symptoms using Beck Depression Inventory-II</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>a 21-item self-report measure used to assess maternal depressive symptoms. Mothers were instructed to indicate which of four statements best described how they felt over the preceding two week period. The BDI is scored from one to four, with higher scores on the BDI indicating a greater degree of depression. A total score on the BDI, which is a sum of the 21-item measure, will be used in the study.</description>
