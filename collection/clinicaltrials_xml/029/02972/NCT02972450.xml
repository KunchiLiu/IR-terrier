  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EVHA T01 is a Phase IIb randomised therapeutic HIV vaccine trial in individuals who started
      antiretrovirals during primary or chronic infection. HIV+ participants will be randomised to
      receive active vaccine or placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EVHA T01 is an international, multicentre, double-blind study which will be a two-arm
      prospective 1:1 randomisation comparing active vaccines with placebo control. Randomisation
      will be stratified according to the stage of infection when antiretroviral therapy (cART)
      was commenced either during primary infection or chronic infection. Screening will take
      place during the 6 weeks prior to randomisation. Eligible participants will be enrolled at
      week 0 and randomised to either vaccine or placebo. They will continue on cART during the 12
      week vaccination period and for 12 weeks beyond. Treatment will then be interrupted and
      resumed when the viral load rebounds to 10,000 or more copies/ml, or the CD4 falls to 350 or
      less cells/mm3, or there is evidence of disease progression, or they have completed 24 weeks
      interruption.
