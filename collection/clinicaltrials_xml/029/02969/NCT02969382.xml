      A study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an experimental drug (SEP-363856) in acutely
      psychotic adults with schizophrenia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, flexibly-dosed, study
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of SEP-363856 in acutely psychotic adult subjects with
      schizophrenia using SEP-363856 (50 or 75 mg/day [ie, once daily]) versus placebo over a
      4-week treatment period. Primary hypoathesis to be tested: H0: μSEP = μPBO versus H1: μSEP ≠
      μPBO, where μSEP and μPBO are the mean changes from Baseline at Week 4 in PANSS total score
      for the SEP-363856 and placebo arms, respectively. Subjects who complete study SEP361-201
      may be eligible to enroll in the open-label extension study SEP361-202.

          4. Subject meets DSM-5 criteria for a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia as established
             by clinical interview (using the DSM-5 as a reference and confirmed using the
             SCID-CT). The duration of the subject's illness whether treated or untreated must be
             ≥ 6 months.

          5. Subject must have a CGI-S score ≥ 4 (moderate or greater) at screening and Baseline.

          6. Subject must have a PANSS total score ≥ 80 and a PANSS subscale score ≥ 4 (moderate)
             on 2 or more of the following PANSS subscale items: delusions, conceptual
             disorganization, hallucinations, and unusual thought content at screening and
             Baseline.

          7. Subject has an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms (no longer than 2 months) and
             marked deterioration of function from Baseline (by history) and subject has been

             consecutive weeks or less immediately before screening.

             Subjects who have been hospitalized for more than 2 weeks for reasons unrelated to
             acute exacerbation can be included with concurrence from the Medical Monitor that
             such hospitalization was other than acute relapse. For example, subjects in a
             long-term hospital setting who have an acute exacerbation and are transferred to an
             acute unit are eligible for the study.

          8. Subject has had no more than 2 prior hospitalizations for treatment of acute
             exacerbation of schizophrenia (not including the current hospitalization).

          9. Subject's BMI must be at least 18 kg/m2 but no more than 35 kg/m2.

         10. Female subject must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening.

         11. Female subject of reproductive potential agrees to remain abstinent or use adequate
             and reliable contraception throughout the study and for at least 30 days after the
             last dose of study drug has been taken. In the Investigator's judgment, the subject
             will adhere to this requirement.

               1. Adequate contraception is defined as continuous use of either two barrier
                  methods (eg, condom and spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide) or a hormonal
                  contraceptive.

                  Acceptable hormonal contraceptives include the following: a) contraceptive
                  implant (such as Norplant®) implanted at least 90 days prior to screening; b)
                  injectable contraception (such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injection) given
                  at least 14 days prior to screening; or c) oral contraception taken as directed
                  for at least 30 days prior to screening.

               2. Subjects who are of non-reproductive potential, ie, subject who is surgically
                  sterile, has undergone tubal ligation, or is postmenopausal (defined as at least
                  12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or between 6 and 12 months of spontaneous
                  amenorrhea with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations within
                  postmenopausal range as determined by laboratory analysis) are not required to
                  remain abstinent or use adequate contraception.

         12. Male subjects with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to avoid
             fathering a child and use acceptable methods of birth control from screening until at
             least 30 days after the last study drug administration.

         13. Subject must be able and agree to remain off prior antipsychotic medication for the
             duration of the study.

         14. Subject must have a total score &lt; 5 on the SAS at Baseline (Day 1).

         15. Subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, generally healthy based on screening
             medical history, PE, neurological examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory
             values (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, lipid panel, coagulation panel,
             thyroid panel, and serum prolactin).

         16. Subject has had a stable living arrangement at the time of screening and agrees to
             return to a similar living arrangement after discharge. This criterion is not meant
             to exclude subjects who have temporarily left a stable living arrangement (eg, due to
             psychosis). Such subjects remain eligible to participate in this protocol.
             Chronically homeless subjects should not be enrolled.

         17. Subject must agree to comply with all restrictions for the required length of time

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject answers &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;Suicidal Ideation&quot; Item 4 (active suicidal ideation with
             some intent to act, without specific plan) or item 5 (active suicidal ideation with
             specific plan and intent) on the C-SSRS assessment at Screening (ie, in the past one
             month) or Baseline (ie, since last visit).

          2. Subject does not tolerate venipuncture or has poor venous access that would cause
             difficulty for collecting blood samples.

          3. Subject is currently participating, or has participated in, a study with an
             investigational or marketed compound or device within 6 months prior to signing the

             signing the informed consent.

          4. Subject has previously received SEP-363856.

          5. Subject has any clinically significant unstable medical condition or any clinically
             significant chronic disease that in the opinion of the Investigator, would limit the
             subject's ability to complete and/or participate in the study:

               1. Hematological (including deep vein thrombosis) or bleeding disorder, renal,
                  metabolic, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, urological, cardiovascular,
                  hepatic, neurologic, or allergic disease (except for untreated, asymptomatic,
                  seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

               2. History of cancer or significant neoplasm.

               3. Disorder or history of a condition, or previous gastrointestinal surgery (eg,
                  cholecystectomy, vagotomy, bowel resection, or any surgical procedure) that may
                  interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion,
                  gastrointestinal motility, or pH, or a clinically significant abnormality of the
                  hepatic or renal system, or a history of malabsorption.

               4. Subject has Alcohol or Substance Abuse Disorder (DSM-5 criteria). The only
                  exceptions include caffeine or nicotine.

               5. Subject has a clinically significant abnormal 12-lead ECG that may jeopardize
                  the subject's ability to complete the study or a screening 12-lead ECG
                  demonstrating any one of the following: heart rate &gt; 100 beats per minute, QRS &gt;
                  120 ms, QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;
                  450 ms (males), QTcF &gt; 470 ms (females), or PR &gt; 220 ms.

          6. Female subject who is pregnant or lactating.

          7. Subject has a lifelong history or presence of symptoms consistent with a major
             psychiatric disorder other than primary schizophrenia as defined by DSM-V unless
             symptoms were rediagnosed as consistent with primary schizophrenia. Exclusionary
             disorders include but are not limited to alcohol use disorder (within past 12
             months), substance (other than nicotine or caffeine) use disorder within past 12
             months, major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, mania, schizoaffective
             disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder. Previous or
             current symptoms of mild to moderate mood dysphoria or anxiety are allowed so long as
             these symptoms have not been a focus of primary treatment.

          8. Subject tests positive for drugs of abuse at screening, however, a positive test for
             amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, benzodiazepines may not result in exclusion of
             subjects if the investigator determines that the positive test is as a result of
             prescription medicine(s). In the event a subject tests positive for cannabinoids
             (tetrahydrocannabinol), the Investigator will evaluate the subject's ability to
             abstain from using this substance during the study. This information will be
             discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to study enrollment.

          9. Subject is at significant risk of harming him/herself or others according to the
             Investigator's judgment.

             phase.

         13. Subject is considered resistant to antipsychotic treatment by the Investigator,
             defined as failure to respond to 2 or more marketed antipsychotic agents, given at
             adequate dose for at least 4 weeks (28 days) within 1 year (365 days) before
             Screening (eg, the subject was hospitalized because of worsening psychotic symptoms
             due to insufficient clinical response or required frequent use of other antipsychotic
             drugs on a temporary basis).

         14. Subject has a history of treatment with clozapine for refractory psychosis and/or
             subject has been treated with clozapine (for any reason) within 4 months of
             Screening.

         15. Subject is receiving a total dose of antipsychotic medication equivalent to &gt; 12.0
             mg/day of haloperidol at Screening.

         16. Subject has received electroconvulsive therapy treatment within the 3 months prior to

             current medication that required dose modification or the addition of
             anti-Parkinson's treatment within the last 6 months.

         20. Subject has any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values (hematology, serum
             chemistry, urinalysis, lipid panel, coagulation panel, thyroid panel, and serum
             prolactin (Note: abnormal findings that may be clinically significant or of
             questionable significance will be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to
             including subject).

         21. Subject demonstrates evidence of acute hepatitis, clinically significant chronic

             surgery during study participation or within 60 days after the last study visit.

         24. Subject has used disallowed prescription or disallowed nonprescription drugs,
             vitamins, or dietary or herbal supplements within 14 days prior to dosing or
             anticipates the need for any disallowed medication during their participation in this
             study [exception: female subjects who are taking oral, patch, or intrauterine device
             (IUD) hormonal contraceptives, or progestin implant or injection]..
