    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to use functional neuroimaging (fMRI) to understand the brain systems
      affected when hypnosis and hypnotic analgesia are augmented with repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation to 100 people with
      fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition. The investigators will measure the effect of rTMS-
      augmentation on the brain networks underlying hypnotizability, as well as the effect of
      rTMS-augmentation on hypnotic analgesia networks. The investigators hope to demonstrate that
      a combination of these psychological and neuromodulatory treatments will be more effective
      than hypnosis alone, thereby enhancing the depth of hypnosis, range of hypnosis and the
      efficacy of hypnotic analgesia and hopefully creating a new treatment modality for
      individuals suffering from pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia pain.

      Overall Study Design. The investigators propose to develop a combinatory approach where an
      integrative technique (hypnosis) is augmented with a neurotechnology (repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation). This application seeks to utilize the previously
      established brain-based mechanisms of both hypnosis and repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation as biomarkers to assess the potential synergistic mechanism of this combinatory
      approach. 100 low-moderately hypnotizable subjects with fibromyalgia will be identified. The
      subjects' response to rTMS-augmentation of hypnosis will be measured. The volunteers will be
      randomized to active or sham rTMS. Two scan sessions will be performed for each subject,
      with the first scan session investigating the effect of rTMS-augmentation on hypnosis and
      hypnotizability (120 min scan session) and the second scan session focused on the effect of
      rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia (120 min scan session). The intent of the first scan
      session is to measure the effect of rTMS on the trait of hypnotizability and on the state of
      hypnosis. The investigators will assess changes in functional connectivity between DLPFC and
      dACC as the connectivity between these two brain regions has been suggested to be a
      neuroimaging surrogate of hypnotizability. The first scan session will also involve hypnosis
      assessments that will allow for a determination of the effects of rTMS directly on hypnosis.
      The second scan session intends to assess the effect of active rTMS-augmented hypnotic
      analgesia on the hypnotic analgesia network. Additionally, the effects of rTMS- augmentation
      of hypnotic analgesia on pain thresholds will be assessed and compared to pre-rTMS
      augmentation baselines.

      Experimental design. Subjects will be asked to refrain from taking any analgesic medication
      for 24 hours prior. Before each MRI scan session, participants will undergo a preparation
      session, where hypnotizability and psychological testing will be conducted. At this time,
      thermal pain training, the determination of laser thresholds will also be done. Volunteer
      subjects will then participate in 2 MRI scan sessions on two separate days, each lasting
      approximately 120 mins. Session 1 (rTMS-augmented hypnosis session) will consist of 4
      control conditions followed by a post-treatment assessment. Session 2 (rTMS-augmented
      hypnotic analgesia) will consist of 3 experimental conditions followed by a post-treatment
      assessment.

      Baseline Mood, Cognitive, and Health Assessments

      The following will be assessed after screening/consent:

      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) The Hypnotic Induction Profile (HIP) Hypnosis Intensity Scale
      (HIS) TASS 2010 Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria Antidepressant Treatment History Form The
      Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Edinburgh Handedness Inventory The
      Opioid Risk Tool The Brief Pain Inventory Ishihara Test (?) MRI Safety Screening Form
      Ishihara Color Vision Test

      Participants (n=100) will then be randomized to active (n=50) versus sham (n=50) rTMS and
      undergo MRI scanning over two days (Session 1 and Session 2). There will be four conditions
      during Session 1 and three conditions on Session 2.

      Session 1: The first session will address Aim 1. Participants will receive the Hypnotic
      Induction Profile prior to any scanning. Participants will then receive 1) [Session 1] a
      baseline scan, whereby high-resolution anatomical images will be collected. This will be
      followed by a 10-minute resting-state fMRI scan, whereby participants will be instructed to
      close their eyes, not think about anything in particular, and refrain from repetitive
      thoughts such as counting. Next participants will receive a 2) [Session 1] baseline scan
      with hypnosis where participants will all receive a hypnotic induction while the subject is
      in the scanner though the use of headphones and a pre-recorded induction script. Hypnotic
      instructions will be standardized, and will involve a simple induction instruction used in
      our prior research on the brain signature of the hypnotic state and in clinical care. 3)
      [Session 1] Next the participant will receive a Hypnotic Intensity Profile to assess
      baseline hypnotic depth. 4) [Session 1] rTMS session occurs after the baseline scans and
      consists of 40 seconds of cTBS followed by 15 min spacing followed by 40 seconds of cTBS as
      has been previously described. The stimulation will be delivered at 80% of the motor
      threshold. 5) [Session 1] Post rTMS baseline scan will be performed where the participant
      will have received rTMS in #5 then receive a post rTMS scan. 6) [Session 1] The study will
      then proceed to rTMS-augmented hypnosis where the participant will be placed in the scanner
      again after the hypnotic induction and scanned during active hypnosis. Hypnosis will be
      induced while the subject is in the scanner through the use of headphones and a pre-recorded
      induction script. Hypnotic instructions will be standardized, and will involve a simple
      induction instruction used in our prior research on the brain signature of the hypnotic
      state. The participant will then repeat the Hypnotic Intensity Scale inside the scanner as
      well as the Hypnotic Induction Profile outside the scanner. Finally, the participant will be
      asked whether they believed that they received active or sham rTMS. There will be at least a
      week between the first scan and the second scan to wash out any effects.

      Session 2: The participant will return and receive pain threshold testing. The participant
      will then receive 1) [Session 1] a baseline scan (similar to above). 2) [Scan Session 2]
      Next, in the baseline scan with pain condition, all participants will passively experience
      and rate laser pain. In this condition, laser stimulations will be delivered to different
      areas at two distinct temperatures. The temperatures will correspond to each participant's
      heat-pain threshold (HPTpre) (i.e., the temperature that elicits a pain intensity rating of
      &quot;1&quot; on the NRS) and suprathreshold (i.e., the temperature at which the participant gives a
      pain intensity rating of 5/10, NRS). 3) [Session 2] rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia. The
      participant will be read a script that includes suggestions related to hypnotic analgesia.
      22 painful laser stimulations will be delivered again in two runs, and participants will be
      asked to rate the pain intensity and unpleasantness. Participants will also rate pain
      intensity and unpleasantness in this condition. 4) [Session 2] rTMS session will be the same
      as described above. Participants will also rate pain intensity and unpleasantness in this
      condition to determine the analgesic effect of rTMS alone on analgesia. 5) [Session 2] Post
      rTMS baseline scan will be performed in the same manner as above. 6) [Session 2]
      rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia. The participant will be read a script that includes
      suggestions related to hypnotic analgesia. 22 painful laser stimulations will be delivered
      again in two runs, and participants will be asked to rate the pain intensity.

      Specifics:

      rTMS administration. Using single pulse TMS the scalp position of lowest motor threshold
      will be determined. Subjects will then be randomly assigned to receive active DLPFC rTMS
      (n=50) or sham rTMS (n=50).

      The investigators will then perform 40 seconds of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS)
      form of rTMS followed by 15 min spacing followed by 40 seconds of cTBS as has been
      previously described. The standardized treatment DLPFC location for the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex will be determined by Localite Neuronavigation and targeted at the
      posterior middle frontal gyrus. The baseline structural scan obtained during the scan 1 will
      be utilized for this localization process. Sham rTMS will have the same neuronavigation
      targeting methods.

      SHAM: Both active and sham DLPFC rTMS will receive simulation from a specially designed
      coil, the Cool-B65 AP Butterfly coil. This coil is capable of delivering either active rTMS
      or sham rTMS in a manner, which is randomized by the system itself and therefore blinded to
      the treater. The sham setting on this coil looks and sounds similar to the active setting,
      but has a hidden aluminum plate blocking actual stimulation.

      Hypnosis induction procedures. Hypnosis will be induced while the subject is in the scanner
      though the use of headphones and a pre-recorded induction script. Hypnotic instructions will
      be standardized, and will involve a simple induction instruction used in our prior research
      on the brain signature of the hypnotic state and in clinical care. The ability to enter and
      maintain the hypnotic state through such an induction mechanism in the fMRI environment has
      been previously demonstrated.

      Pain induction assessment procedures. For the pain task, participants will passively
      experience and rate laser stimuli applied to different regions of the dorsum of their
      fingers/hands using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS). Ratings will be made for both pain
      intensity and pain unpleasantness.. Decreased pain ratings will determine the strength of
      any analgesic effect of treatments. Subjects will be asked to rate their laser-evoked pain
      following each stimulus during each scan. They will separately be asked to rate their
      fibromyalgia-related pain during each scan using the same scale.

      Physiologic data acquisition: Throughout the scanning procedure we will monitor peripheral
      autonomic physiology using MRI compatible EKG leads and a chest belt that monitors
      respiration. This will allow us to compute respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which provides a
      good estimate of vagal tone, which, in turn, is associated with better cardiac health and
      self-soothing. Customized algorithms developed here at Stanford for simultaneous fMRI/EEG to
      remove MRI scanner artifact from the EKG tracing will be applied.
