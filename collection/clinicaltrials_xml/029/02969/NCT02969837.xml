  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a multi-center, open-label, Phase 2 study where newly diagnosed Multiple
      Myeloma requiring systemic chemotherapy will be eligible for enrollment. A total of 55
      subjects will be enrolled. Time to progression or death will be calculated from the date of
      first treatment on protocol until the date of disease progression or death from any cause.
      Patients can expect to participate between 12-24 cycles. The primary endpoint will be the
      rate of response by next generation gene sequencing at the end of 8 cycles among
      non-transplant candidates and transplant candidates who agreed to defer transplant.

      Primary Objective

      • The primary efficacy endpoint will be the rate of sCR and/or the rate of negative MRD by
      next generation gene sequencing (NGS) by clonoSIGHT (Adaptive Biotechnologies) at the end of
      8 cycles among non-transplant candidates and transplant candidates who agreed to defer
      transplant

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of elotuzumab in combination with KRd, when
           administered to subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

        -  To determine the rate of MRD by next generation gene sequencing (NGS) by clonoSIGHT
           (Adaptive Biotechnologies) and by multi-color flow cytometry (MFC) at the end of Cycle
           4, 8,and 12 for all subjects, and end of C18 (for subjects who are MRD+ at the end of
           C8 but MRD- at the end of C12 only), 24 months after C1D1, and yearly after that.

        -  To estimate time to event, including duration of response (DOR), progression-free
           survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS).

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  GEP, proteomics, and gene sequencing to evaluate the correlation between treatment
           outcome and pre-treatment subject profile.

        -  Immunologic correlative studies including FcγRIIIa V genotype.
