      This prospective, post-market, open label clinical study is designed to measure the
      posterolateral fusion rate at 24 months post operative in subjects who have undergone a
      posterolateral fusion using Trinity Elite with or without local bone.

      The study is a prospective, post-market, open label clinical study. Up to 10 sites across
      the United States, with a total enrollment of approximately 120 subjects, will be enrolling
      subjects. The primary objective of this study is to measure the posterolateral fusion rate
      at 24 months when posterolateral arthrodesis is performed using Trinity Elite with or
      without local bone and with supplemental pedicle screw fixation. The primary endpoints are
      radiographic evidence of posterolateral fusion and the absence of serious adverse events
      attributable to Trinity ELITE. The secondary objectives of this study are to measure the
      clinical and economic outcomes when posterolateral arthrodesis is performed using Trinity
      Elite and/or local bone with supplemental pedicle screw fixation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be 18 years of age (â‰¥ 18 years) or older at the time of consent.

          2. Subject must have a documented diagnosis of DDD. DDD is defined by back and/or
             radicular pain with degeneration of the disc as confirmed by medical history,
             physical examination, and radiographic studies that may include CT, MRI, plain X-ray
             film, discography, myelography, etc. with one or more of the following findings:

               -  Instability as defined by &gt;3mm translation or &gt;5 degrees angulation

               -  Osteophyte formation of facet joints or vertebral endplates

               -  Decreased disc height, on average by &gt;2mm, but dependent upon the spinal level

               -  Scarring/thickening of ligamentum flavum, annulus fibrosis, or facet joint
                  capsule

               -  Herniated nucleus pulposus

               -  Facet joint degeneration/changes; and/or

               -  Vacuum phenomenon

          3. Subject may have up to a Grade I Spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine with clinical
             manifestations of one or more of the following phenomena:

               -  Radiculopathy

               -  Sensory deficit

               -  Motor weakness

               -  Reflex changes

          4. Subject must require lumbar posterolateral arthrodesis at 1-4 contiguous levels
             (L1-S1).

          5. The number of levels decompressed must equal the number of levels fused.

          6. Subject must have been unresponsive to conservative care for at least 6 months prior
             to fusion surgery.

          7. Subject must agree not to use electromagnetic adjuncts to enhance bone fusion during
             the course of the study

          8. Subject must be willing and able to sign an informed consent document.

          9. Subject must be willing and able to return for all follow-up visits, agree to
             participate in postoperative clinical and radiographic evaluations and comply with
             the required study regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is under 18 years of age (&lt;18) at the time of consent

          2. Subject has had prior lumbar spine fusion surgery at any level

          3. Subject has greater than grade 1 spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine

          4. Subject is currently undergoing treatment for malignancy or has undergone treatment
             for malignancy in the past 5 years (benign skin cancer is permitted)

          5. Subject is pregnant or nursing or planning to become pregnant during the two years
             (24 months) following arthrodesis

          6. Subject has an active local or systemic infection or is undergoing adjunctive
             treatment for local or systemic infection

          7. Subject requires supplemental interbody arthrodesis.

          8. Subject has an allergy to DMSO.
