    <description>The continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol lasted 40 s and consisted of burst of 3 pulses delivered at 50 Hz, with bursts being repeated every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) for a total of 600 pulses. In the cTBS session, this 40s protocol was repeated for three times (1800 pulses in total) separated by two 15 min breaks (controlled by a stopwatch). MRI dataset should be acquired before the first cTBS session and after the last cTBS session.</description>

    <description>The procedure of this protocol was performed by a placebo coil. Each session lasted 40 s and consisted of burst of 3 pulses delivered at 50 Hz, with bursts being repeated every 200 ms (at 5 Hz) for a total of 600 pulses. No actual magnetic stimulation was applied on the head of the volunteers. MRI dataset should be acquired before the first sham TBS session and after the last sham TBS session.</description>
