    <textblock>
      This is an 8 week study to assess the efficacy and safety profile of PF-06651600 in
      seropositive subjects with rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to methotrexate
      (up to approximately 50% of subjects may also have had an inadequate response to 1 anti-TNF
      biologic).
