    <textblock>
      The current study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the device in the
      common areas of the body affected by different causes of musculoskeletal pain in Vietnamese
      population in real life situation.

      PainGear [ActiPatch®] (BioElectronics Corporation, MD, USA) has been recently introduced as
      an 'topical' analgesic for localized musculoskeletal pain. PainGear is a noninvasive, low
      power, easy to use, pulsed shortwave therapy device for localized musculoskeletal pain. The
      device does not produce heat or any sensation. There are two basic requirements to use the
      device, switching it on via an on/off switch, and affixing the device over the target area
      of the body. The area of treatment is confined to the area within the 11.5-cm diameter loop
      antenna covering an area of 100 cm2, the antennae is circular, soft and flexible and can be
      shaped to fit the area/location being treated as required. The device can be used up to 24 h
      per day and is placed over the area of localized pain either using medical tape or a
      specifically designed wrap.

      In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients with radiographic
      evidence of knee OA (osteoarthritis) and persistent pain higher than 40mm on the visual
      analog scale (VAS) were recruited. The trial consisted of 12 h daily treatment for 1 month
      in 60 knee OA patients. After 1 month, PainGear induced a significant reduction in VAS pain
      and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) scores compared with
      placebo. Additionally, pain tolerance and physical health improved in PainGear -treated
      patients. Twenty-six per cent of patients in the PainGear group stopped NSAID/analgesic
      therapy. No adverse events were detected.

          -  Chronic musculoskeletal pain of more than 6 month duration

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             trial.

          -  In the Investigator's opinion, is able and willing to comply with all trial
             requirements.

          -  Male or female ages 18-80 years old

          -  A current VAS pain rating ≥5/10

          -  Able to complete and tolerate treatment for the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant Woman

          -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the trial, or may
             influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to participate in the
             trial.

          -  Participants who are not able to understand verbal or written English, and for whom
             adequate translation/interpretation cannot be readily obtained
