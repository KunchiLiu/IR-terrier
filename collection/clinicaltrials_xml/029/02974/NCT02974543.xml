  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a subject operated device to lessen
      tinnitus (ringing in the ear), based on subject-feedback for stimulus presentation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study enrolls 20 adult subjects. This project will develop and test a device with the
      ultimate goal of providing a patient operated device to alleviate phantom sound perception,
      or tinnitus, based on patient-feedback for stimulus presentation.

      The device, an electrical-acoustical stimulus timing, is based on physiological findings of
      stimulus-timing-dependent plasticity in somatosensory and auditory nuclei,that when
      aberrant, contribute to tinnitus.

    <measure>Change in TFI (Tinnitus Functional Index) after treatment or sham compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks on treatment (or sham)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in TFI score (mean of weekly assessments for 4 weeks) from baseline for treatment and sham groups. TFI is a clinical questionnaire that assesses tinnitus impact on a subject's quality of life. Is uses a scale of 0 - 100 where 0 means no negative impact on quality of life from tinnitus and 100 is devastating impact It will be administered weekly through out the study.</description>

    <description>To mitigate potential placebo effects, subjects receive both a sham treatment and an active treatment. The subjects will be blinded to which treatment they are receiving. Both treatments are delivered using a take-home device programmed in the lab.
During active treatment, the device will deliver electric somatosensory and auditory stimulation.</description>

    <description>Somatosensory stimulation will be delivered by pads positioned on the cheek overlying the trigeminal ganglion, the juncture of the temporomandibular joint or on the neck at overlying cervical nerves, c1 or c2, determined by the manner in which the subject can modulate the tinnitus.
The auditory stimulus will be individualized based on subject baseline audiogram and tinnitus test results and is presented through a calibrated earphone.</description>
