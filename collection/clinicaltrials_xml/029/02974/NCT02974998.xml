      This two-arm cluster randomized trial will test a gender-focused comprehensive HIV testing
      and counselling (HTC) program, the Young Women's CoOperative (YWC) with a standard HTC
      program and will target female adolescents (aged 16-19) who use substances and have dropped
      out of school. To evaluate the process, the study will examine the feasibility of using peer
      role models as recruiters and co-facilitators of the intervention and monitor fidelity to
      the intervention. Efficacy of the intervention on behavioral and biological outcomes, and on
      linkages to health services, through follow-up visits conducted 6- and 12-months
      post-intervention will be also assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a gender-focused comprehensive HIV testing and
      counselling (HTC) program, the Young Women's CoOperative (YWC) with a standard HTC program
      in 24 disadvantaged communities in Cape Town, South Africa. The researchers will conduct
      community-level randomization across the 24 communities with balanced recruitment from
      predominantly Black African and predominantly Coloured disadvantaged communities. The aims
      of the study are: Aim 1. To train and evaluate adolescent peer role models to conduct
      community outreach with established outreach workers to recruit 500 out-of-school,
      substance-using female adolescents aged 16 to 19 for HIV testing and counseling (HTC) and to
      co-facilitate a gender-focused comprehensive HTC program. Aim 2. To test the efficacy of a
      young women's gender-focused comprehensive HTC program for reducing substance use,
      victimization, and sexual risk behavior (primary outcomes) and improving access to effective
      treatment and support services through linkages to care (substance abuse treatment, HIV,
      sexually transmitted infections [STIs], antenatal and reproductive health as secondary
      outcomes) relative to standard HTC for adolescent females. The Young Women's CoOperative has
      been adapted from the South African Women's Health CoOperative (WHC) and the North Carolina
      Young Women's CoOperative (YWHC) which was found acceptable in recent focus groups and
      maintains all the core elements of the evidence-based intervention. For this study, the
      intervention will be co-facilitated by trained peers from the local communities. The
      intervention currently consists of two 1.5-hour group workshops (sessions), each having
      several modules that are usually administered a week apart: Workshop 1: Developmental Issues
      and Alcohol and Other Drugs; Gender, Problem-Solving and Conflict Negotiation, Violence and
      Values and Becoming a Powerful Young Woman: and Workshop 2: STIs, HIV/AIDS, Prevention,
      Condoms and Role-play. After each session, each participant will develop a risk-reduction
      personalized action plan (PAP). To maintain PAP goals and reduce decay of intervention
      effects over time, the staff will conduct bi-monthly case management to help participants
      attain these personal goals. Participants will complete baseline, 6-month follow-up and
      12-month follow-up assessments, which includes a survey and biological testing for substance
      use, pregnancy and HIV.
