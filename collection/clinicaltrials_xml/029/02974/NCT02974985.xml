  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are tested in-vitro to measure their lifting capacity,
      viscosity, cohesivity, and rheologic properties, and their lifting capacity has been tested
      in animal models. To date, there are no studies that measure the lifting capacity of fillers
      in an in-vivo human model.

      The intention is to study the lifting capacity of fillers in a group of patients by
      comparing pre and post-procedure two and three-dimensional photographs using analytic
      software. Specifically, the PI is interested in determining the amount of tissue elevation
      created by injecting HAs Restylane-Lyft®, (Galderma Laboratories, L.P., Fort Worth, TX) to
      the midface and to the lower face, both in the anterior-posterior direction and in the
      vertical direction using analytic software.

      The research group has identified a reliable and reproducible quantitative assessment of
      midfacial position called WIZDOM (Width of the InterZygomatic Distance Of the Midface) to
      quantitatively evaluate the midface. It can be used as an objective tool to assess midfacial
      rejuvenation, whether with fat, fillers, or midface or facelift surgery. The Distance from
      WIZDOM to inner canthus, the WIZDOM -IC measurement increases with aging as the face
      deflates and descends, and, in the practice, is also a means of assessing the midface in
      youth and in aging. The PI's findings have been submitted to the Aesthetic Surgery Journal.
      The practice will attempt to utilize this metric as a measure of midface aesthetic lifting
      capacity.

      The practice will also employ 3 D photography and analytic software to determine degree of
      lift in mm in the y and z axis. (vertical and AP increase in dimension) pre and post-
      injection. (Vectra, Canfield, Fairfield, NJ)

      A secondary goal of this study is to measure duration of efficacy and patient satisfaction
      at various endpoints. A standardized rating system will be used - the Medicis Midface Volume
      Scale (MMVS) -measured by three independent physicians and the subjective Global Aesthetic
      Improvement Scale (GAIS) -measured by the subject and three independent physicians -to
      monitor outcomes at follow-up.

      All fillers will be injected in locations where the FDA has approved it for on-label
      indications (the cheek, subcutaneously and supraperiosteally, the dermis and subdermis for
      the correction of wrinkles and folds such as the nasolabial fold) and placed as usual and
      customary using techniques as practiced by the authors and as are accepted widely.

      Additional steps prior to injection for this study are temporary sterile magic marker
      markings markers on the face and detailed photography that will be taken before, during, and
      after injection, and the segmentation of injections such that the midface will be injected
      prior to and separately from the lower face.

      Follow-up will also be more rigorous than routine, on an approximately q 3 month basis for
      up to 2 years.

      Patients will be allowed to have additional HA fillers placed in the perioral area
      subsequent to the initiation of the study to augment/define the lips and to treat perioral
      rhytids during their follow-up period. These treatments area allowed outside of the study
      and not part of this study. The PI assumes that the addition of fillers in these locations
      will have no impact on the midface or the jawline, but will be of added aesthetic benefit to
      patients. All filler will be administered through the office by the PI.
