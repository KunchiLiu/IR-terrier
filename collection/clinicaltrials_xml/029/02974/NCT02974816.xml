    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare HbA1c of insulin-treated subjects with type 2
      diabetes managed via usual care alone and usual care augmented with remote monitoring using
      Glooko

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigator wants to evaluate if diabetes self-management supported by a
      mobile application, which captures a subject's blood glucose readings, lifestyle and
      medication information and shares it with the subject's certified diabetes educator (CDE) to
      enable remote monitoring, improves their glycemic control compared to standard of care.

    <description>Subjects in this arm will visit their physician once every 3 months and will receive usual care. In addition, in between clinic visits, subjects will measure their blood glucose (BG) readings at least once a day and share their BG readings with their CDE using Glooko's mobile application. Once a week, the CDE will review the subject's BG readings on Glooko's population tracker and reach out to the subjects if he/she experienced clinical incident(s). During the conversation, the CDE will either recommend medication or lifestyle modification to address the clinical incident.</description>

             psychological condition that may interfere with compliance with study protocol
             procedures
