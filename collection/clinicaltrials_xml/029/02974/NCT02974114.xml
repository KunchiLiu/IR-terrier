  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This parallel, assessor blind, placebo-controlled, stratified, randomized study will
      investigate the effects of everyday pain on cognition and mobility in otherwise healthy
      individuals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will also evaluate the relationship between specific types and intensity of
      everyday pain with cognitive function and mobility. Finally, the potential effect of an
      intervention with paracetamol or paracetamol with caffeine on cognitive function and
      mobility will be also studied on an exploratory basis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Axon Sports Cognitive Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized test will be performed to measure cognitive performance i.e psychomotor speed. Simple reaction time (SRT, milliseconds, msec), error (msec) and error adjusted SRT (msec) will be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reaction Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>In this five-choice reaction time task the participant will hold down a button at the bottom of the screen until a yellow spot appears in one of the five circles at the top of the screen. They will then release the button and touch inside the circle where the yellow spot appeared as quickly as they can. The key outcome measure for this task is median five-choice reaction time (the median duration, msec) between the onset of the stimulus and the release of the button. Calculated for correct, assessed trials where the stimulus could appear in any one of five locations).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rapid Visual information Processing (RVPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome variable is RVPA (A prime) and it will be the signal detection measure of sensitivity to the target, regardless of response tendency (the expected range will be 0.00 to 1.00; bad to good).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Attention Switching Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome will be the AST congruency cost (median; msec) which is the difference between the median latency of response (from stimulus appearance to button press) on the trials that were congruent versus the trials that were incongruent. It will be calculated by subtracting the median congruent latency (in msec) from the median incongruent latency. A positive score will indicate that the participant is faster on congruent trials and a negative score will indicate that the participant is faster on incongruent trials.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spatial Working Memory (SWM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome variable is the SWM between errors and is defined as times the participant revisits a box in which a token has previously been found. This is calculated for trials of four, six and eight tokens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome variable will be the OTS problems solved on first choice which is the number of assessment problems on which the first box choice made was correct.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip Force</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>This task will be a measure of grip strength force (Newtons). The participant will hold the dynamometer in their dominant hand and the arm is swung from above the head to by the side of the body. If the dominant arm or hand is painful then the non-dominant hand will be used. Participant will be instructed to assert maximum effort during the squeezing motion and maintain it for about 4 seconds using a metronome. Participant will conduct the movement 4-times (1 practice effort and 3 test efforts) and there will be a 1-minute recovery period between each effort. The result from 3 test efforts will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to standing</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>From a seated position with arms crossed so that the right hand is placed on the left shoulder and the left hand on the right shoulder, participants will stand to a fully erect stature in as short a time as possible. Time to standing which will be measured using a stopwatch (msec). Participants will conduct the movement 3-times continuously as a practice effort and 5-times continuously as a test effort at each visit. There will be a 1-minute rest between the practice and test effort. Difference in average time to standing between baseline (pain-state), post-intervention and pain free follow-up assessments will be analysed for the test effort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ground Reaction Force</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>From a seated position with arms crossed so that the right hand is placed on the left shoulder and the left hand on the right shoulder, participants will stand to a fully erect stature in as short a time as possible. GRF (ground reaction force, newtons) will be measured during the movement analyzed using a force plate interfaced with a computer. Participants will conduct the movement 3-times continuously as a practice effort and 5-times continuously as a test effort at each visit. There will be a 1-minute rest between the practice and test effort. Difference in average peak GRF between baseline (pain-state), post-intervention and pain free follow-up assessments will be analysed for the test effort.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait (Contact phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will perform a walking assessment in comfortable walking shoes. An athletic movement analysis system (Optojump, Microgate) will be utilized which will be set up over a 15 meters (m) length of track with only the 5-10m section measured and analysed. Participants will be instructed to walk the 15m length a minimum of 6 times (3 practice and a minimum of 3 test walks) always entering the 15m length with the same foot first. The foot (left or right) entering the 5-10m section first will be recorded by visual assessment of the Optojump operator for the test walks. Test walks will be repeated until there are 3 walks in which the participants has entered the 5-10m section with the same foot first. Parameters will be averaged based on the 3 test walks in which this occurs. Difference in contact phase (m/s, milliseconds) and its within-test variability will be analyzed between baseline (pain state), post-intervention and pain-free follow-up assessments.</description>

    <measure>Gait (Stride length)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will perform a walking assessment in comfortable walking shoes. An athletic movement analysis system (Optojump, Microgate) will be utilized which will be set up over a 15m length of track with only the 5-10m section measured and analysed. Participants will be instructed to walk the 15m length a minimum of 6 times (3 practice and a minimum of 3 test walks) always entering the 15m length with the same foot first. The foot (left or right) entering the 5-10m section first will be recorded by visual assessment of the Optojump operator for the test walks. Test walks will be repeated until there are 3 walks in which the participants has entered the 5-10m section with the same foot first. Parameters will be averaged based on the 3 test walks in which this occurs. Difference in stride length (cm, centimeters) and within-test variability will be analyzed between baseline (pain state), post-intervention and pain-free follow-up assessments.</description>

Test walks will be repeated until there are 3 walks in which the participants has entered the 5-10m section with the same foot first. Parameters will be averaged based on the 3 test walks in which this occurs. Difference in walking speed over 5-10m (metres/second) and within-test variability will be analyzed between baseline (pain state), post-intervention and pain-free follow-up assessments.</description>
