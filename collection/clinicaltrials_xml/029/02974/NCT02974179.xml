      The study is designed to assess the long term safety of subjects who have been treated in
      the phase 3 study with AMG0001. A health questionnaire will be used to collect specific
      information from the subject every 6 months. Only those subjects that were randomized in the
      AG-CLI-0206 study and who received AMG0001 are eligible to participate in this long term
      follow-up study. Subjects that received placebo will not be eligible for participation in
      this study.
