  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test a brief family intervention (the BFI) to enhance
      individually-delivered PTSD treatment for Veterans.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll pairs of Veterans and one adult family member who lives with
      them. Veterans will be beginning a course of PTSD-focused treatment at the Boston VA;
      Veterans' treatment will not be limited or changed by their participation in this study.

      Family members will receive or not receive (depending on which Phase of the study they are
      recruited in) the BFI. The BFI consists of 2 sessions in which the family member meets
      one-on-one with a clinician to discuss PTSD, PTSD treatment, and how families can be most
      helpful to patients in treatment.

      Veterans and family members will also be interviewed about their opinions and experiences
      regarding family-inclusive treatment for PTSD.
