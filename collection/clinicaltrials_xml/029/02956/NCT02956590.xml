      This trial of pitavastatin will determine efficacy and safety in this high risk population
      and provide evidence for clinicians to target this treatable risk factor to achieve an
      impact on early atherosclerosis, and potentially achieve primary prevention of adult
      cardiovascular disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of pitavastatin for 2 years
      comparing the effect of study drug versus placebo on vascular measures in at least 354 obese
      (body mass index &gt;95th percentile) adolescents with CDO (defined as high non-HDL-C + high
      TG/HDL-C ratio or low HDL-C). Enrollment will take place over 18 months.
