      To evaluate the interaction of food on the pharmacokinetics of Dexibuprofen 300 mg (Apsen
      Pharmaceuticals A / S.), after single dose oral administration to healthy subjects of both
      sexes, under fasting and fed conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single oral dose of test medicine will be administered to participants in a practical
      period with the aid of 200 mL of water at room temperature. During administration,
      participants must remain seated.

      Participants will be confined at least 12 hours prior to administration and will remain for
      about 24 hours after the same, totaling about 36 hours of confinement.
