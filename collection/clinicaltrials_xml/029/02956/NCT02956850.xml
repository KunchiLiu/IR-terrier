  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This sponsor-open, investigator- and participant-blinded, multi-center study will assess the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RO7020531 in healthy
      participants and in participants with chronic hepatitis B. Part I will be conducted in two
      portions: Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) which will include
      only healthy volunteers. Part II will commence after completion of the MAD portion of Part I
      and will include only Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) participants.
