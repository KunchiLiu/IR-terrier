  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals are to change the paradigm for development of mechanism targeted
      pharmacotherapy in neurodevelopmental disorders and provide a definitive test of the mGluR
      theory in humans by determining whether AFQ056, an mGluR5 negative modulator, can enhance
      neural plasticity in the form of language learning during an intensive language intervention
      in very young children with fragile X syndrome. This trial therefore will use an innovative
      but exploratory new trial design to develop a different way to examine efficacy of an agent
      with substantial support as a drug targeting CNS plasticity in preclinical models of a
      developmental disorder. If the design is successful, this trial can serve as a model for
      future trials of mechanistically-targeted treatments operating on neural plasticity in other
      neurodevelopmental disorders.

      The trial will use a double blind placebo-controlled parallel-group flexible-dose forced
      titration design in which 100 subjects with FXS, age 32 months to 6 years of age will enter
      a 8-month placebo-controlled phase in which they are randomized 1:1 to AFQ056 or placebo
      followed by an 8-month (open label) extension phase in which all participants will be
      treated with active drug. The flexible dose design will mimic practice, take into account
      differential responsiveness and the known inter-child variability in drug levels with
      AFQ056, and allow use of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is likely to be most effective.

    <measure>Language - Weighted Child Intentional Communication Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weighted Communication Score is coded from a 15 minute semi-structured examiner/child play session and reflects child initiated communication that involves the child's use of gestures, eye contact, vocalizations, and/or words and word combinations to communicate a message to a listener. The Weighted Communication Score coded from a standardized play session has been used in cohorts with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and has been able to measure change in language skills with age and change in language skills in response to an intervention. Goal is to demonstrate greater improvement in language learning in young children with FXS treated with AFQ056 in combination with an intensive standardized parent-implemented language intervention, relative to those treated with the language intervention and placebo, after 6 months of intervention, as a marker of drug effect on neural plasticity, the core problem in the disorder</description>

    <description>8 month phase in which subjects are randomized to AFQ056. The initial dose of AFQ056 will be 25 mg BID. If the subject has no side effects the dose will be titrated (mandatory titration if no side effects) to the next level, 50 mg BID, 75 mg BID and 100 mg BID in order. A flexible dose design will mimic practice, and allow use of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is likely to be most effective. The dose can be adjusted weekly through week 7. After 7 weeks the dose will be fixed, and at the 2 month visit all subjects will initiate the language intervention, remaining on a stable AFQ056/placebo dose for the next 6 months.</description>
