      This randomized controlled trial will enrol patients with acute severe brain injury who pass
      a spontaneous breathing trial but have decreased level of consciousness. It will directly
      compare (1) prompt extubation vs. (2) prompt tracheostomy vs. (3) usual care, with
      extubation or tracheostomy timed according to physicians' discretion. The primary outcome
      will be ICU free days (days spent alive and outside an ICU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thousands of patients suffer severe brain injuries every year, from causes such as trauma,
      stroke, and infection. Extensive clinical research in weaning from mechanical ventilation
      has led to recommendations for prompt extubation following a successful trial of spontaneous
      breathing in general intensive care unit (ICU). However, little evidence exists to guide
      decisions about when to remove the breathing tube in patients with severe brain injury. It
      is unclear which of the following strategies would optimize important patient outcomes:
      prompt extubation vs. prompt tracheostomy vs. waiting and extubating or performing a
      tracheostomy, timed according to physicians' discretion. Each strategy has associated risks:
      prompt extubation may lead to higher rates of extubation failure and reintubation, prompt
      tracheostomy may lead to an excess of unnecessary procedures, and waiting longer may expose
      patients to complications from prolonged mechanical ventilation.This trial in brain-injured
      patients will test will of the following will lead to better patient outcomes: (1) removing
      the temporary breathing tube promptly; (2) performing a tracheostomy promptly; or (3) the
      usual treatment you would have received if you were not enrolled in this trial.

The primary outcome will be measured to answer the following primary question: Among patients receiving minimal mechanical ventilatory support for severe and persistent brain injury, which of the following airway management strategies increase ICU-free days to day 60: (1) prompt extubation vs. (2) prompt tracheostomy vs. (3) usual care, which may include extubation or tracheostomy timed according to physicians' discretion?</description>

    <description>This is an insertion of tracheostomy. Tracheostomy must be done within 48 hours of randomization. If for any reason the patient does not receive a tracheostomy according to the randomized schedule, the reason(s) will be recorded on a protocol violation form and the site investigator will be notified. We will remind the treating physician of the treatment assignment and ask them to reassess the patient for tracheostomy on a daily basis. If a patient is extubated instead of receiving a tracheostomy we will again record reasons for this, but the patient will be analysed in the tracheostomy group according to the intention-to-treat principle. In all participating centres, percutaneous tracheostomies are routinely performed in the ICU.</description>

    <intervention_name>Extubation</intervention_name>
    <description>This is an extubation by removal of endotracheal tube which must be done within 48 hours of randomization. Any decision to subsequently reintubate the patient will be left to the discretion of the clinical team. Similarly, if a tracheostomy is deemed necessary in a patient who fails the extubation attempt, this will be managed at the discretion of the treating team. If for any reason the patient is not extubated according to the randomized schedule, the reason(s) will be recorded on a protocol violation form and the site investigator will be notified. If a patient receives a tracheostomy instead of being extubated we will again record reasons for this, but the patient will be analysed in the extubation group according to the intention-to-treat principle.</description>

    <intervention_name>Usual Care</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients in this group will be treated according to usual care, which may include extubation (removal of endotracheal tube) or insertion of a tracheostomy, timed according to physicians' discretion. The inclusion of this arm will allow both intervention arms - prompt extubation and prompt tracheostomy - to be compared to usual practice, which often involves further observation and delayed decision-making due to clinician uncertainty about the optimal airway management strategy. Incorporation of usual care arms has been promoted as a design feature to improve the safety and interpretability of critical care clinical trials.</description>
