      Aim: A non-invasive, effective, compatible, Integrative treatment option to address the
      growing burden of Vascular disease; Importance: Ayurvedic SUVED (cardio tonic, continuous
      clotlysis, endothelial repair, powerful rejuvenator, antioxidant) and Reimmugen (Cow
      Colostrum - IgG, GF) provides sustained Functional, symptomatic relief with clinical reports
      of regression of disease. No adverse interactions reported.

      Application: Addition of SUVED &amp; REIMMUGEN helps in:

        -  Acute MI, Thrombotic stroke, DVT, hastens symptomatic recovery, reduces hospitalization
           time, mortality, helps dissolve clots / soft thrombus; reversal of atherosclerotic
           plaques; improves functional life

        -  Improvements in Cardiac Function : LVEF; Global perfusion

        -  Rejuvenation of endothelium, vascular function.

        -  Improved physical strength: digestion; GI function; immunity; accelerated internal
           healing

        -  Secondary prevention to avoid incidences in post event treatment.

      Health condition/problem studied Vascular disease, esp CVA, IHD, CAD, DVT, PAD Volunteers
      taken from OPD and IPD of SKNMC &amp; GH with prior consent for participation.

      Intervention is Medicament based given in addition to conventional ongoing therapy under the
      guidance of SKNMC doctors.

      Study type Clinical trial: Double Blind placebo controlled trial. Interventional Trial:

           in addition to ongoing medication to study the additional benefit to patient in their
           functional and clinical investigations.

      The control intervention/s is/are the interventions against which the study intervention is
      evaluated as double blind placebo.
