             immunomodulating drugs treatments within 8 weeks before screening.

          -  Use of beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor
             blockers, or calcium channel blockers within 4 weeks before screening.

          -  History of ischemic cardiovascular diseases.

          -  Use of biologics any other unconventional allergen immunotherapy within 12 months

             blood or blood components.

          -  Have a history of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions a component of ANB020
             formulation or the inactive ingredients (excipients).

          -  If female, are pregnant or lactating, or intend to become pregnant during the study
             period.

          -  Current diagnosis of asthma requiring Global Initiative for Asthma Assessment (GINA)
             Step 3 or higher treatment or asthma partially controlled or uncontrolled according
             to GINA classifications in the last three months before screening (Appendix I).

          -  History of a life threatening asthma attack (example: requiring an intensive care
             unit admission, intubation with mechanical ventilation).

          -  Other significant medical conditions that in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator, prevent participation in the study

          -  History of drug, alcohol or other substance abuse, or other factors limiting the

          -  Have any other physical, mental, or medical conditions which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, make study participation inadvisable or could confound study
             assessments.
