    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study of guadecitabine vs treatment
      choice (TC). Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either guadecitabine or
      TC. TC options include the 8 high or low intensity, locally available regimens below; or
      Best supportive Care (BSC) alone:

        -  High intensity (intermediate or high dose cytarabine [HiDAC]; mitoxantrone, etoposide,
           and cytarabine [MEC]; or fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony stimulating factor
           [G-CSF], +/- idarubicin [FLAG/FLAG-Ida]).

        -  Low intensity (low dose cytarabine [LDAC], decitabine, or azacitidine).

        -  BSC.

    <textblock>
      This Phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel-group multicenter study of the efficacy and
      safety of guadecitabine in adults with previously treated AML will be conducted in
      approximately 20 countries. There will be a 14-day screening period, a treatment period, a
      safety follow-up visit, and a long-term follow-up period. The study is expected to last
      approximately 2 years. Duration of individual subject participation will vary, and subjects
      may continue to receive treatment for as long as they continue to benefit.

      Approximately 404 subjects from approximately 100 study centers will be randomly assigned to
      either guadecitabine or treatment choice (TC) in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 202 subjects per
      group). TC is as follows:

        -  High intensity: intermediate or high dose cytarabine (HiDAC); mitoxantrone, etoposide,
           and cytarabine (MEC); or fludarabine, cytarabine, G-CSF, +/- idarubicin
           (FLAG/FLAG-Ida).

        -  Low intensity: low dose cytarabine (LDAC), decitabine, or azacitidine.

        -  Best Supportive Care (BSC).

      Guadecitabine will be given SC at a dose of 60 mg/m2 in 28-day cycles. In Cycle 1,
      guadecitabine will be given for 10 days on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12. Cycle 2 will be either
      the 5-day regimen (Days 1-5) or 10-day regimen (Days 1-5 and 8-12) based on assessment of
      disease response and hematologic recovery at the end of Cycle 1. In subsequent cycles,
      guadecitabine treatment will be for 5 days only (Days 1-5).

             substance abuse or addiction that, in the opinion of the investigator, predisposes

         12. Refractory congestive heart failure unresponsive to medical treatment; active
             infection resistant to all antibiotics; or non-AML-associated pulmonary disease
