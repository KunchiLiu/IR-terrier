      This pilot study will test the hypothesis that prolonged regional peripheral nerve block
      will reduce development of chronic pain in patients undergoing surgery for ankle fracture
      compared to standard of care. Subjects will be followed for one year.

      This pilot study will test the hypothesis that prolonged regional peripheral nerve block
      will reduce development of chronic pain in patients undergoing surgery for ankle fracture.
      Regional nerve block using local anesthetics delivered by ambulatory pump is used in some
      types of surgeries but is not routine for ankle fracture patients in our hospitals. Patients
      will be randomized to standard care (single shot peripheral nerve block prior to surgery) or
      experimental (the same single shot nerve block, followed by continuous popliteal nerve block
      with ropivacaine starting just after surgery). The primary outcome will be scores on a
      validated ankle/foot pain questionnaire that includes questions on function. Subjects will
      be followed for one year. Secondary outcome will be postoperative opioid use.
