      The main objective of this study will be to assess the efficacy of natural progesterone at a
      daily dose of 25 mg/bid in the maintenance of early pregnancy in women with symptoms of
      threatened abortion. The secondary objectives will be the efficacy of progesterone in
      reducing both pain and uterine contractions.
