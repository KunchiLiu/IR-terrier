  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to collect data pertaining to the safety and
      performance of the ACURATE neo (TM) Aortic Bioprosthesis as implanted with the ACURATE neo
      (TM) TA Transapical Delivery System. This device is intended for treatment of subjects with
      severe aortic stenosis (AS) who have high risk for conventional aortic valve replacement
      (AVR) surgery. The ACURATE neo (TM) Aortic Bioprosthesis is intended for use via
      minimally-invasive transapical implantation in a well-defined population.

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, prospective, multicenter non randomised and open trial of the
      treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis where conventional aortic valve
      replacement (AVR) via open heart surgery is considered to be high risk. All patients will be
      followed up to 5 years after the intervention.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and performance of the study device in
      patients presenting with severe aortic stenosis considered to be high risk for surgery
      Secondary objective is to evaluate adverse events and study device performance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be at least 18 years old

          2. Severe aortic stenosis defined as:

               -  Mean aortic gradient &gt; 40 mmHg or

               -  Peak jet velocity &gt; 4.0 m/s or

               -  Aortic valve area of &lt; 0.8 cm2

          3. High risk patient determined by a multidisciplinary heart team consensus
             (cardiologist and cardiac surgeon) that patient is not a surgical candidate for
             conventional AVR due to risk factors such as STS Score (8% or higher) or other
             co-morbid conditions unrelated to aortic stenosis such as severe chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD), chest deformities and irradiated mediastinum
