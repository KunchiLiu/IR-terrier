  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, double blinded, pivotal
      trial to study the safety and efficacy of the WiSE-LV System for Cardiac Re-synchronization
      Therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WiSE-LV System is an implantable cardiac pacing system capable of delivering pacing
      energy to the left ventricle of the heart without using a pacing lead.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with a class I or IIa (1) or (2) indication for implantation of a (Cardiac
             Resychronization Defibrillator) CRT-D device according to current available
             guidelines AND are either 'Non-Responders' to Cardiac Resychronization Therapy (CRT)
             OR 'Previously Untreatable' (described below):

               -  Non-Responder: Patients who have a CRT system that is functional and despite an
                  adequate trial of Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) and attempts at
                  optimal device programming the patient has not responded to therapy for a
                  minimum of 6M. Non-response is defined as remaining clinically unchanged or
                  worsened:

                    1. Ejection Fraction (EF) has remained unchanged or worsened, and

                    2. The patient's clinical status based in the totality of available clinical
                       evidence (such as NYHA Class, exercise tolerance, QOL, or global
                       assessment) has remained unchanged or worsened, as determined by the local
                       Site Enrollment Committee.

               -  Previously Untreatable: Patients who have a full or partial CRT system, who meet
                  general inclusion criteria and are deemed as 'previously untreatable' for one of
                  the following reasons:

                    1. Patients in whom coronary sinus (CS) lead implantation for CRT has failed

          -  Noncardiac implanted electrical stimulation therapy devices

          -  Mechanical aortic valves or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) valves

          -  Unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft
             (CABG), or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within the past 1
             month

          -  Correctable valvular disease that is the primary cause of heart failure

          -  Recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (within the
             previous 3 months)

          -  Persistent or permanent atrial arrhythmias (or cardioversion for atrial fibrillation)
             within the past month

          -  Already included in another clinical study that could confound the results of this
             study

          -  Pregnancy
