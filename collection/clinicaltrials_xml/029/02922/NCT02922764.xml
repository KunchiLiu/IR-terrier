      Study RGX-104-001 is a Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation and expansion study of
      RGX-104, an oral small molecule targeting the liver X receptor (LXR). RGX-104 activates LXR,
      resulting in depletion of both myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as well as tumor
      blood vessels. MDSCs block the ability of T-cells and other cells of the immune system from
      attacking tumors.

      During the dose escalation stage, multiple doses and schedules of orally administered
      RGX-104 will be evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphoma (i.e., locally
      advanced and unresectable, or metastatic) who have had progressive disease (PD) on available
      standard systemic therapies or for which there are no standard systemic therapies of
      relevant impact. In the expansion stage of the study, additional patients with melanoma,
      non-small cell lung cancer, epithelial ovarian carcinoma, or breast cancer will be treated
      at the MTD (or maximum tested dose if no MTD is identified, or dose below the MTD if there
      is evidence suggesting a more favorable risk/benefit profile) to provide further
      characterization of RGX-104 safety, efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics, including biomarkers
      of immunologic activity and LXR target activation.

             lymphoma (any histology) and must have disease that is resistant to or relapsed
             following available standard systemic therapy, or for which there is no standard
             systemic therapy or reasonable therapy likely to result in clinical benefit.

          2. The patient must have advanced disease, defined as cancer that is either metastatic
             or locally advanced and unresectable (and for which additional radiation therapy or

             (MUGA) scanning.

          9. If the patient is a woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP), she has had a negative
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to treatment.

         10. The patient (male and female) agrees to use acceptable contraceptive methods for the
             duration of time on the study, and continue to use acceptable contraceptive methods
             for 1 month after the last treatment with RGX-104.

         11. The patient has signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific
             procedures or treatment.

         12. The patient is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements, including follow-up for survival assessment.

         13. Tumor tissue (a minimum of 5 and up to 10 unstained slides, or paraffin block),
             ideally from the patient's most recent biopsy, must be delivered from the patient's
             local institution to the site prior to treatment with RGX-104.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has persistent clinically significant toxicities (Grade ≥2) from previous
             anticancer therapy (excluding Grade 2 chemotherapy-related neuropathy and alopecia
             which are permitted, and excluding Grade 2-3 laboratory abnormalities if they are not
             associated with symptoms, are not considered clinically significant by the
             Investigator, and can be managed with available medical therapies).

          2. The patient has received treatment with chemotherapy, external-beam radiation, or
             other systemic anticancer therapy within 14 days prior to RGX-104 administration (42
             days for prior nitrosourea or mitomycin-C; patients with advanced prostate cancer who
             are receiving luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists are permitted
             onto the study and should continue use of these agents during study treatment).

          3. The patient has received treatment with an investigational systemic anticancer agent
             within 14 days prior to RGX-104 administration.

          4. The patient has previously received treatment with RGX-104 or another investigational
             agent that is a known LXR agonist.

          5. The patient has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of
             the study endpoints. Patients with a past cancer history (active malignancy within 2
             years prior to study entry) with substantial potential for recurrence must be
             discussed with the Sponsor before study entry. Patients with the following
             concomitant neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in
             situ (including transitional cell carcinoma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and
             melanoma in situ), organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of progressive
             disease.

          6. The patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or
             any New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, uncontrolled
             angina, history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke within 6 months
             prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmias
             not controlled by medication).

          7. The patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications
             during the study.

          8. The patient has known active or suspected brain or leptomeningeal metastases (central
             nervous system [CNS] imaging is not required prior to study entry unless there is a
             clinical suspicion of CNS involvement). Patients with stable, treated brain
             metastases are eligible provided there is no evidence of CNS disease growth on
             imaging for at least 2 months following radiation therapy or other locoregional
             ablative therapy to the CNS.

          9. The patient has a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids
             (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within
             14 days prior to RGX-104 administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal
             replacement doses &gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of
             active autoimmune disease.

         10. The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             uncontrolled infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

         11. The patient is pregnant or breast feeding.

         12. The patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus active or
             chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.

         13. The patient is oxygen-dependent.

         14. The patient has a history of pancreatitis.

         15. The patient has Grade ≥2 hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol &gt;300 mg/dL or &gt;7.75
             mmol/L) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride &gt;300 mg/dL or ≥3.42 mmol/L) in the
             fasting state.

         16. QTcF &gt;450 msec (males) or &gt;470 msec (females).

         17. The patient has a cataract of Grade ≥2 for posterior subcapsular cataract, cortical
             cataract, nuclear opalescence, or nuclear color based on the Lens Opacities
             Classification System III (LOCS III).

         18. The patient requires statin (e.g., rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, etc.) therapy.

         19. The patient requires treatment with a medication that is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4
             (boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole,
             ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole,
             ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, or voriconazole).

         20. The patient requires treatment with a pH elevating agent, including H2 blockers,
             proton pump inhibitors, and antacids. If the medication is considered to be medically
             necessary, the patient should be discussed with the Medical Monitor.

         21. The patient has any medical condition which in the opinion of the Investigator places
             the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.
