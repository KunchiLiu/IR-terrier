      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the
      Endoscopic Linear Cutter Stapler and reloads from Fengh Medical used in laparoscopic
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery to create anastomoses. The goal of the study will be
      achieved by assessing the device performance and reporting of peri- and postoperative
      complications in a prospectively maintained database.
