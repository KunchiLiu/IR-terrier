  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will further develop and test the Tailored Telephone Intervention delivered by
      Peers to Prevent Recurring Opioid Overdoses (TTIP-PRO), a promising, low-cost, intervention
      to facilitate entry into medication assisted treatment (MAT) for individuals experiencing a
      non-fatal opioid overdoses (OOD). A prior small-scale pilot/feasibility study of TTIP-PRO
      (NCT02282306) found that the participating patients and the Peer Interventionists were
      satisfied with their participation, the intervention was acceptable, and the system for
      generating patient-tailored intervention information performed well. The overall goal of the
      present study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of TTIP-PRO versus a control
      group. It is hypothesized that patients in the TTIP-PRO group will have more favorable
      drug-abuse-related outcomes than patients in the control group.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a randomized controlled intent-to-treat (ITT) clinical trial. Potential
      participants will be recruited from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC)
      Emergency Department (ED) where they are being treated for an OOD. Approximately eighty
      eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the control condition
      (Information and NARCAN® (naloxone) Nasal Spray kit) or to the experimental condition
      (TTIP-PRO in addition to the elements provided in the control condition). All participants
      will complete a follow-up phone call approximately 3-weeks post-randomization, during which
      process measures will be completed, and in-person visits at approximately 3, 6-, and
      12-months following enrollment.

      This is a single site study; all data will be collected at the University of Cincinnati.
      Approximately 80 participants will be randomized into this pilot efficacy trial. The
      hypotheses to be tested include that participants assigned to the TTIP-PRO intervention
      will: have a higher rate of enrollment in MAT, have a lower rate of recurring opioid
      overdose, and have greater reduction in illicit opioid use.

    <description>Naloxone nasal spray (NARCAN) is a potentially life-saving medication that can stop or reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. This nasal spray is approved by the FDA for reversing OODs and has a favorable side-effects profile. A take-home kit will be provided to the patient participants, which may be useful in the event of a future opioid overdose.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data will be shared in a timely manner, i.e., no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset. The dataset will include information about illegal activities (e.g., illicit opioid use, etc.). Thus, in addition to only a de-identified database being shared, we will also require a data sharing agreement. The data sharing agreement will require commitment to: 1) not re-disclose the data; 2) secure the data; 3) use the data for research purposes only; 4) make no attempt to identify individual participants; 5) destroy the data once the planned research activities have been completed; 6) follow all relevant NIH policies.</ipd_description>
