    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the possibility of a new, non-invasive, non-drug
      treatment for Parkinson's disease. The treatment involves gentle vibratory stimulation
      delivered to the fingertips (called 'vibrotactile stimulation'). Along with the treatment,
      participants will also undergo kinematic testing.

      Patient will be phone screened and/or have a physical and neurological examination to
      determine if it is appropriate for them to participate in this study. This testing includes
      the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III (UPDRS III). Research assistants will
      explain the study and obtain informed consent. There will be three consecutive days of
      testing, as well as 2 follow up visits at 1 and 4 weeks. Visits include the following:
      Patients will have sensors put on their hands, feet, and chest. These sensors measure their
      movement while they perform kinematic tasks such as forward walking, wrist movements, and
      the UPDRS III. Patients will also be given vibrotactile stimulation for a total of 4 hours
      throughout the day. During this time, patients will be provided with books/movies as
      entertainment, and they may move around freely. Patients will also be asked to complete
      several questionnaires throughout the visits about their Parkinson's symptoms.

    <description>The tactile stimulator is being tested for an off-label use as treatment for Parkinson's disease. There are nodes embedded into the fingertips of gloves that gently vibrate in an alternating pattern. The sensation is similar to the feeling of a phone vibrating. This is a non-significant risk device.</description>

          3. A diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Hoehn and Yahr Stage II or III

          4. Able and willing to come to study visits (3 consecutive days, as well as 2 follow up
             visits, at 1 and 4 weeks)

          5. Able and willing to stop therapy during the daytime for the days they come to the

          7. If on medication, the patient should be on stable doses of Sinemet and/or Stalevo
             (Carbidopa/Levodopa Parkinson's medication) as part of their medicinal regimen
             (Patient does not need to be on medication to be included in the study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects, who are pregnant, are capable of becoming pregnant, or who are breast
             feeding.

          2. Subjects with very advanced Parkinson's disease, Hoehn and Yahr stage IV on
             medication (non-ambulatory).

          3. Have significant cognitive impairment and/or dementia, as determined by a neurologist
             at the Stanford Movement Disorders Clinic.

          4. Have an implanted electronic device such as a cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator or
             medication pump.

          5. Subjects who have an inability to comply with study follow-up visits.

          6. Subjects who are unable to understand or sign the informed consent.

          7. Have an MRI showing focal brain lesions that could indicate a non-idiopathic movement
             disorder.

          8. Have an active infection.

          9. Require diathermy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or transcranial magnetic
             stimulation (TMS) to treat a chronic condition.
