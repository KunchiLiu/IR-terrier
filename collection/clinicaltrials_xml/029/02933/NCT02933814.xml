    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate pain management regimens following ambulatory hand
      surgery. Improved pain control may be associated with decreased complications, decreased
      pain scores, decreased opioid dependence, improved patient comfort and satisfaction, and
      reduced healthcare costs. Liposomal bupivacaine is an FDA-approved local anesthetic. There
      will be two groups. One group will receive liposomal bupivacaine. One group will not. The
      results will be compared.

      Patients will be over the age of 18 ambulatory hand surgery. Approximately 40 subjects will
      participate in this study at LLU.
