    <textblock>
      The accelerated rehabilitation protocol in Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA-AR) was designed to
      improve the functionality and optimize early discharge of patients undergoing THA surgery.
      This study compared physical therapy protocol in Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA-PT) already
      deployed in Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital with THA-AR.

    <description>Day 1) Patients received verbal orientation and demonstration of the physiotherapy exercises that would strengthen muscles (gluteal and thigh). They were oriented to the decubitus changes and how to leave the bed. They practice 3 repetitions of 12 complete movements for each exercise. Some exercises were performed in bed. Other exercises the patient performed while sitting in a chair;
Day 2) Patients repeat the day 1 and were instructed on gait training. And after the repetition of day 1 and the instruction they performed gait training. The day 2 was repeated until the discharge date.</description>
