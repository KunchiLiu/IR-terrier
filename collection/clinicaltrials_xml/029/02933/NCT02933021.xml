      This is a study to investigate the functional consequences of paraprotein production in MGUS
      (Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) is a common haematological condition.
      It is characterised by proliferation of a B lymphocyte clone and it's associated antibody
      (paraprotein). In most cases there are no clinical symptoms, however, in a small number of
      individuals there may be an interaction of the paraprotein with a molecule expressed by the
      body (self antigen). This can have effects on the normal function of this molecule and/or
      cause disease.

      The study aims to investigate the functional consequences of paraprotein production in MGUS.
