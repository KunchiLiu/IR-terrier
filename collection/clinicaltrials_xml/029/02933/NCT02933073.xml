      This is a phase I trial to test the safety and feasibility of OncoImmunome vaccine in stage
      III/IV ovarian cancer patients. OncoImmunome is a tumor specific vaccine formulation which
      is predicted to elicit tumor-protective immune responses. A total of 15 patients will be
      enrolled from the Principal Investigator (PI) clinical practice. These patients will have
      successfully completed standard of care surgical debulking, chemotherapy treatment and be in
      clinical remission prior to receiving the vaccine. The patients receive 6-monthly doses of
      the vaccine and are monitored for up to 5 years post vaccination. This is a personalized
      vaccine, unique to each patient and is the &quot;first in human&quot; use.

      The study will be conducted under an IRB approval, in accordance with FDA regulations and
      Human Subject Protection regulations. Female patients with suspected FIGO Stage III/IV
      epithelial adenocarcinoma of ovarian, tubal or peritoneal origin will be screened and
      enrolled at their initial clinic visit. Patients will undergo standard of care therapy to
      include exploratory laparotomy and debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy. Only those
      with histologically confirmed Stage III/IV epithelial ovarian/tubal/peritoneal carcinoma
      will be continued in the study. At the time of initial standard therapy, a portion of the
      surgically resected tumor as well as normal cells obtained from peripheral blood shall be
      used for extraction of RNA and DNA; these samples shall be used for sequencing of the tumor
      and normal transcriptomes, as well as normal exam sequencing, in the Genomic Core Facility
      at UConn Health. Patient's blood cells shall also be HLA typed.

      Following completion of standard chemotherapy (6-8 cycles every 3 weeks) and Investigator's
      confirmation of clinical remission, patients will be again consented as subjects for the
      experimental investigative portion of the study.

      The overall purpose of this research study is to produce and test the safety of a new
      experimental vaccine called OncoImmunome in people with Stage III/IV Ovarian Cancer. An
      &quot;experimental vaccine&quot; is a vaccine that is being tested and is not approved for sale in the
      United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study has been divided
      into two parts: 1)Tumor Tissue and Blood Sample Collection and 2) Vaccine and Follow-up.

      Study participants will consent to the following:

        1. Tumor Tissue and Blood Sample Collection: The purpose of this part of the study is to
           collect participants' blood and tumor tissue and test it for genetic mutations. These
           test results will be used to manufacture a study vaccine that is unique to the
           participant and to their ovarian cancer.

        2. Vaccine and Follow-up: The purpose of this part of the study is to test the safety of
           the experimental drug (vaccine) called OncoImmunome, which has been produced
           specifically for each participant.

      Subject participation in this research study will last up to 5 years. The vaccine was
      produced over a 6 month period, and for six months subjects will receive the study vaccine
      (1 study vaccine dose per month or 6 study vaccine doses total). However, the researchers
      will continue to collect all subjects information for up 5 years from the time they provided
      their tumor sample and blood for the research.

    <description>The OncoImmunome will be a substance composed of a mixture of seven to ten peptides each containing 17-18 amino acids. Given that the vaccine will be tumor-specific based upon mutant peptide sequences identified in each tumor transcriptome, the vaccine for each patient will likely be a unique composition.</description>
