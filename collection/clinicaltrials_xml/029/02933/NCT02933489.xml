    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well abbreviated breast magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and digital tomosynthesis mammography work in detecting cancer in women with
      dense breast. Abbreviated breast MRI is a low cost procedure in which radio waves and a
      powerful magnet linked to a computer and used to create detailed pictures of the breast in
      less than 10 minutes. These pictures can show the difference between normal and diseased
      tissue. Digital tomosynthesis mammography is a procedure that uses multiple x-rays pictures
      of each breast to produce a 3-dimensional rendering of the entire breast. Combined screening
      with abbreviated breast MRI and digital tomosynthesis mammography may be a better method to
      screen women with dense breasts.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rates of detection of invasive cancers with abbreviated breast
      (AB)-magnetic resonance (MR) and digital tomosynthesis mammography (DBT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the positive predictive value (PPV) of biopsies, call back rates, and
      short-term follow up rates after AB-MR and DBT on both the initial and 1 year follow up
      studies.

      II. To estimate and compare the sensitivity and specificity of AB-MR and DBT, using the 1
      year follow up to define a reference standard.

      III. To compare patient-reported short-term quality of life related to diagnostic testing
      with AB-MR and DBT using the Testing Morbidities Index.

      IV. To compare willingness to return for testing with AB-MRI versus (vs) DBT within the
      recommended screening interval and explore factors associated with willingness to return for
      screening.

      V. To compare the tumor biologies of invasive cancers and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
      detected on AB-MR and DBT.

      VI. To estimate the incident cancer rate during 3 years following the year-1 AB-MR/DBT when
      patients return to standard screening.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (DBT, AB-MR): Participants undergo DBT followed by AB-MR for under 10 minutes on the
      same day at baseline and then after 1 year.

      ARM II (AB-MR, DBT): Participants undergo AB-MR for under 10 minutes followed by DBT on the
      same day at baseline and then after 1year.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up yearly for 3 years.
