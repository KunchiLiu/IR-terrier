        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed, well-differentiated advanced, non-functional neuroendocrine
             tumor of GI, pancreatic or thoracic origin.

          -  No history of, and no active symptoms related to carcinoid syndrome.

          -  Patients must have been pretreated for advanced disease - the number of prior
             systemic therapy/regimen depends on which origin.

          -  Patients must be willing to provide biopsy material.

          -  Radiological documentation of disease progression while on/or after the last
             treatment; progression must have been observed within 6 months prior to start of
             study treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma,
             adenocarcinoid, goblet cell carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and small
             cell carcinoma.

          -  Pretreatment with interferon as last treatment prior to start of study treatment.

          -  Prior treatment for study indication with:

          -  Antibodies or immunotherapy within 6 weeks before the first dose of study treatment.

          -  PRRT administered within 6 months of the first dose.

          -  Systemic antineoplastic therapy

          -  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer,
             before the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Prior PD-1- or PD-L1-directed therapy.

          -  Cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, or trans-arterial chemoembolization of hepatic
             metastases

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies which in
             the opinion of the investigator may pose an increased risk of a serious infusion
             reaction.
