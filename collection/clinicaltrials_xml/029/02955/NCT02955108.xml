  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to look at the effects of distractive auditory stimuli (DAS)
      on reducing dyspnea intensity and related anxiety and increasing exercise tolerance.
      Investigators hope that compared to a no-music control condition, that under a music
      condition participants with COPD will (a) demonstrate increased self-paced walk distance and
      enjoyment; (b) have less dyspnea intensity, (c) experience less dyspnea anxiety; (d) have
      less fatigue and state anxiety; and (e) higher maximum heart rate. The upbeat music with a
      tempo of 90 - 100 bpm (an average-to-moderate walking tempo) is expected to have distractive
      and performance enhancing effects in order to increase tolerance to dyspnea and exercise.
      The long-term goal of this study is to increase physical activity in adults with COPD and
      RLD by promoting dyspnea and fatigue management through use of distractive auditory stimuli
      in the form of music.

      This randomized clinical trial will use a cross-over design. The research will include two
      within-subject factors, music versus no music and time. Each subject will be randomized a
      single time to receive either music first then no music, or alternatively, no music first
      then music during two walk tests.

    <description>Borg Breathlessness Scale. The Borg dyspnea scale is a single-item rating scale, ranging between 0, &quot;nothing at all&quot;, and 10, &quot;very, very severe (maximal)&quot;. Patients will be asked to rate their level of dyspnea during the walk test using the 10-point Borg scale after the 6MWT.64 Validity of the Borg scale for measuring dyspnea intensity has been shown.65</description>

    <description>Participants will self-select 1 music piece from a list of choices to keep the rhythm and tempo consistent throughout the 6MWT. The instructions to participants for selecting the music will be standardized. TThe music volume will be standardized to be &quot;moderately loud&quot; as rated by participants for the music condition. Participants will not be specifically instructed to synchronize their walking movements with the music tempo. The music is based on a cognitive therapy (distraction) strategy conceptual framework. Music will be played during the 6MWT (in-task) only.</description>
