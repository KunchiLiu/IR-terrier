  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods. Period 1 is a 12-week,
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period designed to compare the
      safety and efficacy of ABT-494 versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of
      participants with moderately to severely active RA who are on a stable dose of csDMARDs and
      have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. Period 2 is a blinded 52 week extension period to
      evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 in participants with RA
      who have completed Period 1.
