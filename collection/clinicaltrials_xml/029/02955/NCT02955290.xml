    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of CIMAvax vaccine and
      nivolumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III-IV non-small
      cell lung cancer. Vaccine therapy, such as CIMAvax vaccine may help slow down and stop tumor
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block a protein needed by tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Giving CIMAvax vaccine together with nivolumab may work better in
      treating patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify the maximum dose of CIMAvax in combination with nivolumab based on dose
           limiting toxicities (DLTs) as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
           Events version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03). (Phase I)

        -  To examine the effect of the dose and the dosing intervals (starting in the expansion
           phase of cohort 2) on antibody titers when CIMAvax is combined with nivolumab in the
           second-line therapy of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase I) III. To
           evaluate the 12-month overall survival of CIMAvax combined with nivolumab in patients
           with advanced NSCLC. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the toxicity of CIMAvax combined with nivolumab using the Cancer Therapy
           Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria
           for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03). (Phase I)

        -  Determine the preliminary efficacy of the study combination utilizing immune-related
           Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) guidelines. (Phase I)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To conduct correlative studies comparing serum EGF levels, platelet levels, markers of
           immune response and functionality of antibody response. (Phase I)

        -  To examine the association of EGFR (total and activated), PD-1 and PDL-1 expression and
           mutations in tumor tissue with biomarkers of genetic and immune response. (Phase I)

        -  Comparison of response assessment criteria for a prospective analysis (irRECIST
           response assessment (1, 2) (Appendix C) vs. irRC (3) (Appendix DAppendix D) vs. RECIST
           1.1 (4)). (Phase I)

        -  To characterize the blood EGF levels and other blood-based biomarkers of patients
           censored from the trial because of low titer response. (Phase II)

        -  To examine the association of EGFR (total and activated), PD-1 and PDL-1 expression and
           mutations in tumor tissue with biomarkers of genetic and immune response. (Phase II)

        -  Comparison of response assessment criteria for a prospective analysis (irRECIST
           response assessment (1, 2) (Appendix C) vs. irRC (3) (Appendix DAppendix D) vs. RECIST
           1.1 (4)).(Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of CIMAvax followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive CIMAvax vaccine intramuscularly (IM) and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over
      60 minutes on day 1. Courses with nivolumab repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unexpected toxicity. Treatment with CIMAvax vaccine repeats every 2 weeks.
      Within 4 weeks after the 4th dose, patients receive CIMAvax vaccine IM every 4, 8, or 12
      weeks for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 120 days.
