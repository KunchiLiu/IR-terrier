  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meditation is an approach that focuses on the connection between mind and body that uses
      techniques with breath, sound, or movement. It has been the focus of research because of its
      possible benefit for lowering distress and improving health and quality of life. The
      meditation techniques in this study are already used in clinical practice. They are based on
      the Tibetan tradition and focus on use of sound and breathing techniques.

      The goal of this research study is to learn how self-administered meditation (meditation
      participant completes on their own) can improve participant's mood-related symptoms, such as
      depression and anxiety. Researchers also want to learn how to deliver pre-recorded
      meditations using a computer-based application (program, or &quot;app&quot;).

      Baseline Visit:

      Participant has already had assessments as part of participant's routine care that helped
      show that participant was eligible to take part in this study. If participant agrees to take
      part in this study, the following tests and procedures will be performed at participant's
      first study visit:

        -  Participant's vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate)
           will be measured.

        -  Participant's medical history will be collected.

        -  Participant will be asked about any drugs participant may be taking and any side
           effects participant may be having.

        -  Participant will complete a questionnaire about how participant feels about meditation.
           This questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete.

        -  Participant will complete a basic demographic information (ethnicity, gender, age, and
           so on) questionnaire. This questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete.

        -  Participant will complete 4 questionnaires about any symptoms participant may have. The
           questionnaires should take about 15-20 minutes total to complete.

      Study Groups:

      After the baseline visit has been completed, participant will be randomly assigned (as in
      the toss of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.

        -  If participant is enrolled in Group 1, participant will be given access to a
           computer-based meditation program for 2 weeks.

        -  If participant is enrolled in Group 2, participant will be in the control group and
           will receive access to social workers, support groups, spiritual care, and other
           patient services.

      Meditation Group (Group 1):

      If participant is in Group 1, participant will be given a device (such as a phone, tablet,
      or computer) that has the meditation app already installed on it. On participant's first
      day, participant will watch a pre-recorded video in the app that tells participant about the
      practice of meditation and what to expect during meditation (for example, participant will
      do deep breathing and visualization exercises). Participant will return the device at the
      end of your participation.

      If the device is lost, damaged, or stolen please tell the research staff as soon as
      possible.

      Participant will be encouraged to meditate at least 1 time every day for up to 2 weeks using
      the meditation app. Participant will be able to set a reminders through the meditation app.

      Each day, participant will open the app and select a 5-, 10-, or 15-minute long meditation
      session that participant will follow along with. Participant will complete a questionnaire
      about participant's mood before and after each meditation session through the app which will
      take less than 1 minute to complete each time.

      The app will track how many times participant meditates each day, how long participant
      meditates for, and when participant meditates. This information, including participant's
      mood questionnaire responses, will be sent to the study staff.

      Control Group (Group 2):

      If participant is assigned to the waitlist control group participant will not receive the
      meditation app for the first 2 weeks. Participant will have access to participant's doctor
      as well as access to social workers, support groups, spiritual care, and other patient
      services.

      All Participants:

      At the end of the study period, all participants may have access to the meditation guidance
      recordings (audio files only), if requested.

      Length of Study:

      Participation on this study will last up to 2 weeks.Participant will no longer be able to
      take part in meditation if participant's symptoms gets worse or if participant is unable to
      follow study directions.

      Participation in this study will be over after participant has completed the end-of-study
      visit.

      End-of-Study:

      After participant has completed the meditation program for Group 1 or after 2 weeks for
      Group 2:

        -  Participant's vital signs will be measured.

        -  Participant's medical history will be recorded.

        -  Participant will be asked about any drugs participant may be taking and any side
           effects participant may be having.

        -  Participant will complete the same 4 questionnaires that participant completed at
           screening.

        -  Participant will have an interview with a member of the study staff. Participant will
           be asked questions about participant's opinions on meditation and if participant thinks
           they benefitted from meditation. This interview should take about 10 minutes to
           complete.

      This is an investigational study. The use of meditation for anxiety in cancer patients is
      considered investigational. The lead researcher can explain how meditation is designed to
      work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
