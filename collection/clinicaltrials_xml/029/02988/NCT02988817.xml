      The purpose of the trial is to establish the tolerability of HuMax-AXL-ADC in a mixed
      population of patients with specified solid tumors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of two parts; a dose escalation part (phase I, first in- human (FIH)) and
      an expansion part (phase IIa).

      The dose escalation part has two dose escalation arms: the first arm investigates a once
      every 3 weeks (1Q3W) dose schedule and the second one investigates a three administrations
      over 4 weeks (3Q4W) dose schedule.

      The Expansion part of the trial, will further explore the recommended phase 2 dose of
      HuMax-AXL-ADC as determined in Part 1
