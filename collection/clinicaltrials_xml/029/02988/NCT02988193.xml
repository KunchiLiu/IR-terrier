      The purpose of the PRECISION study is to compare a clinical reasoning artificial
      intelligence for hypertension treatment management with usual care (UC) and enhanced care
      (EC) in patients with poorly controlled hypertension.

      GOAL: Conduct a prospective randomized pilot clinical trial embedded within the care
      delivery system at University of California Medical Center (UCSF MC). It is intended to
      evaluate the efficacy of a decision support clinical reasoning artificial intelligence in
      improving medication treatment management for patients with poorly controlled hypertension
      (HTN). Its primary goal is to de-risk the implementation of a subsequent randomized and
      powered for clinical efficacy trial.

      RECRUITMENT: patients with uncontrolled HTN (≥10 mmHg above BP national guidelines goal) at
      UCSF MC Cardiology Clinic.

      STUDY: Three-arms study: (a) optima4BP surveillance and treatment recommendation support
      (O4BP); (b) usual care (UC) - usual care seen as needed by the treating physician; (c)
      enhanced care (EC) - UC + raw remotely collected BP values sent to the treating physician.

      All patients will undergo at least 2 in-office visits, a baseline visit and an exit visit.

      All patients will be asked to provide every 30 days the following information: (a) adherence
      to current HTN treatment; and (b) experienced side-effects and severity. Health-e-Heart
      (HeH) automated system (https://www.health-eheartstudy.org/) will collect the Qardio® data,
      as frequently as the patient records them, and provide patients with a unique link to a
      secure web interface for reporting of side-effects, adherence, and symptoms.

      Every 30 days, the collection of patient information will be followed by an arm-specific
      action. For identified patients in need of a medication change, O4BP physicians will receive
      a treatment change recommendation for review. UC physicians will not receive any
      information, while EC physicians will receive curated BP values reported by the patient.

      ANALYSES: The impact of O4BP arm on coordination of care will be determined by:

        -  evaluating interoperability between multiple platforms in
           collecting-structuring-exchanging data

        -  evaluating improvement in quality of care (physician adoption) and quality of life
           (patient adoption) versus EC and UC care.
