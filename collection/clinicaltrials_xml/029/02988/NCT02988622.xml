  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the 1550-nm non-ablative Fraxel laser (referred to
      as Fraxel Laser in this application) to the ablative 10,600-nm carbon dioxide fractional
      laser (referred to as CO2 Laser in this application) to determine if one is superior to the
      other in improving the appearance of scars over a series of three treatments. In addition,
      the investigators hope to identify a more cost-effective method to improve the appearance of
      scars caused by surgery or trauma.

    <textblock>
      This study will be accomplished through a controlled split-scar study design whereby half of
      the scar will be treated with the Fraxel Laser and the other half of the scar will be
      treated with the CO2 Laser. This study is a blinded, prospective comparative, split-scar
      study whereby 100 participants will be recruited, enrolled and followed for a period of 9
      months. The study population will include male and female participants, age 18 and over with
      scars secondary to surgery or trauma on any part of the body. The study will recruit
      participants with light colored skin, Fitzpatrick Type I-IV, because colored skin has a
      significantly higher risk of keloid scarring. The scar must measure a minimum of 4 cm in
      length to accommodate for the split-scar treatment. The participants will undergo laser
      treatments on Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 3 and each visit will be 4 weeks apart. The
      participants will return for evaluation and follow-up 3 months and 6 months following the
      last laser treatment. At each visit, photographs will be taken using identical camera
      settings, lighting and participant positioning. Evaluation of the scars will be completed by
      the participants and by blinded dermatology physicians. Participants will use a complete
      visual analogue scale at each visit, the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS)
      and a satisfaction score.
