      This research project addresses critical gaps in cancer symptom management through the
      creation of a mobile chemotherapy symptom management application. This application will
      assess for the presence and severity of common chemotherapy side-effects and provide
      personally tailored symptom-related video and narratives to enhance self-management of
      cancer and treatment-related symptoms. This study will examine patient acceptance and use of
      this mHealth application (called MyChemoCare) in a prospective trial of cancer patients
      (n=60) who are receiving chemotherapy for colorectal cancer at the University of Michigan
      Comprehensive Cancer Center.

    <description>Participants will receive access to the the MyChemoCare iPad application, which allows them to track cancer and chemotherapy related symptoms daily, and suggests strategies that may help the participant deal with these symptoms. While using the application, high symptom severity scores will be reported to the participant's medical team, who may intervene to help relieve the symptom. Participants will also be contacted if they have not checked in for 48 hours to make sure they are coping well with their chemotherapy regimen.</description>
