  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine a web-based training program for treating emotional
      problems in people who have suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to examine how subjects with TBI feel about the virtual reality
      program as a treatment and to assess the effectiveness of the virtual reality program at
      increasing subjects' awareness and understanding of emotions.
