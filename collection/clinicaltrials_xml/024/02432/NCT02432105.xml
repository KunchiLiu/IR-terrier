        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM) or chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) and
             eligible for bilateral myringotomy and tympanostomy tube insertion.

          -  Suspected bacterial infection at time of surgery in at least 1 ear.

          -  Willing to refrain from water immersion of the ears following surgery without the use
             of adequate ear protection during swimming, bathing, showering and other
             water-related activities.

          -  Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) must read and sign the informed consent.

          -  Parent or caregiver must agree to comply with the requirements of the study and
             administer study medication as directed, complete required study visits, and comply
             with the protocol.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous otologic or otologic-related surgery within the past 30 days or ongoing
             complications.

          -  Middle ear pathology in either ear other than otitis media.

          -  Current acute otitis externa (AOE), malignant otitis externa (MOE) or other
             conditions which could interfere with evaluation of the study drug.

          -  Any systemic disease or disorder, complicating factor or structural abnormality that
             would negatively affect the conduct or outcome of the study based upon assessment by
             the Investigator.

          -  Known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to quinolones or other active or
             inactive ingredients present in the medications to be used in the study.
