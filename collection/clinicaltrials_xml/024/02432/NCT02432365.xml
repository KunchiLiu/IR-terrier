  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose was to establish a quick (7-day) cycle schedule of paclitaxel (60 mg/m2)
      combining with cisplatin (40 mg/m2) NAC regimen could be tolerated without interfering the
      following surgical treatment and a favorable overall survival rate for stages IB2 and IIA2
      cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

      This is a multi-center, open-label, Simon's 2-stage, phase II study of paclitaxel and
      cisplatin as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with FIGO IB2 or IIA2, squamous cell cervical
      carcinoma of the uterine cervix.

      Primary Objectives:

      â€¢ Overall survival

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Safety

        -  Progression-free survival

        -  Response rate

        -  Postoperative RT/CRT rate

        -  To assess Quality-of-life

      An estimate of 64 evaluable patients will be enrolled in this phase II investigation.

    <description>The primary objective is to determinate the difference in 5-year survival rate of subjects with NAC+RH-PLND compared with standard CCRT. Based on the pilot research, the 5-year survival rate of NAC+RH-PLND is expected to be around 87.5%. Thus, a sample size of 64 subjects in NAC+RH-PLND group is required for correctly detecting a 12.5% difference between 5-year OS rate of NAC+RH-PLND group and a reference value 75% of standard CCRT in order to achieving an 80% power at a significance level 0.05.</description>
