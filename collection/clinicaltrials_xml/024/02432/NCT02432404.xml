      To assess potential benefits associated with both intermittent (use for 3 weeks, remove for
      1 week, as defined in the package insert) and continuous (use for 4 weeks, then replace) CVR
      use among women either with BV or at high risk for BV. The investigators will also recruit
      women who are HSV2-infected.

      The investigators objective is to study effects of a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR)
      containing estrogen and progesterone (NuvaRing) on vaginal bacteria (the vaginal
      microbiome), local immunity, and lower genital tract infection in women. Emerging data
      suggest a favorable effect of this CVR on vaginal bacteria, specifically hydrogen
      peroxide-producing lactobacilli (LB), which are supported when the vagina is under the
      influence of estrogen. These lactobacilli are critical for defense against infection with
      HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is
      characterized by loss of these LB and instead, overgrowth of a mix of anaerobic bacteria. BV
      significantly increases risk of STI/HIV, including genital herpes caused by HSV2. BV is
      characterized by declines in protective immunologic mediators (certain defensins, secretory
      leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI)) and increases in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
      alteration of cervical immune cell populations and activation of local immune cells,
      including T cells. Whether local delivery of hormones through a product like the CVR
      restores the lactobacilli and the protection they provide from BV and STI/HIV is unknown. In
      contrast, the contraceptive systemic depot progesterone—commonly used worldwide—may
      independently increase risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. The investigators
      overarching hypothesis is that NuvaRing contributes to reduction in BV, healthy markers of
      cervicovaginal immune response and decreased rates of HSV2 shedding. Long-acting vaginal
      delivery of hormonal contraception as the foundation of &quot;multicomponent prevention&quot; - for
      example, delivery systems that can combine activity against unintended pregnancy, HIV, and
      other STI—has become a major focus for scientists, advocates, and funders alike, but effects
      on the vaginal environment need careful definition before broad implementation.

      The need for contraceptive options has taken on urgency with evidence indicating that
      systemic hormonal contraception (primarily injectable, long-acting progestin) may increase
      women's risk of HIV acquisition and transmission to male sex partners. Lack of other
      contraceptive options is a critical barrier to progress towards optimizing women's
      reproductive health. Moreover, BV remains a major problem for women, causing symptomatic
      vaginitis and conferring increased risk for adverse outcomes of pregnancy and STI/HIV
      acquisition. The investigators propose to explore the hypothesis—supported by limited
      data—that a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) that is commonly used in the U.S., the
      NuvaRing, will enhance women's genital and reproductive health. The investigators propose
      that this CVR will increase the bacteria that help the vaginal environment protect against
      infection by HIV and other STIs, reduce rates of BV, and that in women who already have
      HSV2, use of the CVR will lower HSV2 shedding in the female genital tract. Importantly, CVR
      acceptability in general is excellent. Moreover, the format of drug delivery through the
      form of a vaginal ring is also being intensely explored with the use of antiretroviral
      agents (dapivirine, tenofovir) as a means of topical, female-controlled HIV prevention, and
      formulation work with several antiretroviral drugs for sustained delivery with the NuvaRing
      format is underway.

      The investigators believe the NuvaRing specifically will enhance vaginal health because they
      hypothesize that it will promote the growth of the Lactobacillus bacteria that protect women
      from infection with HIV and other STI. These bacteria, called L. crispatus and L. jensenii,
      are promoted by adequate levels of vaginal estrogen. These bacteria maintain low vaginal pH
      (&lt;4.7) by producing lactic acid. BV occurs when these vaginal lactobacilli are replaced by
      overgrowth of other vaginal bacteria (primarily anaerobes, or bacteria that live in
      low-oxygen conditions). BV is the most common cause of vaginal complaints in
      reproductive-aged women. In pregnant women, BV is strongly associated with increased risk of
      preterm births and pregnancy-associated infections. In non-pregnant women, BV increases the
      risk of pelvic infections, and acquisition of multiple STI, including HSV2 and HIV. BV may
      elevate these risks in several ways, including activation of local immune cells. Finally,
      recent data indicate that onset of menstruation triggers key shifts in local vaginal
      bacteria, and in many women, may actually precipitate BV. Continuous use of the NuvaRing
      (use for four weeks, then replace) suppresses menstruation, and is increasingly used by many
      women with excellent reports of acceptability and safety. Whether this suppression of
      menstruation could suppress BV recurrence is not known.

      Although short-term antibiotic therapy improves symptoms and restores Lactobacillus
      predominance in most women with BV, up to 20% of women fail routine therapy. In addition, BV
      recurrence after successful therapy is the rule. Recurrence is likely caused by failure to
      recolonize the vagina with desirable lactobacilli, which requires adequate vaginal
      estrogenization. In one study, women who used the NuvaRing for 3 consecutive 28-day cycles
      had higher quantities of desirable vaginal lactobacilli relative to women who used oral
      contraceptive pills containing 20 μg ethinyl estradiol and 100 μg levonorgestrel.15 The
      NuvaRing releases 120 mcg/day of ENG (the active metabolite of desogestrel, a progesterone)
      and 15 mcg/day of ethinyl estradiol (the estrogen component). While generally well
      tolerated, incidence of local complaints (increased vaginal discharge or discomfort) with
      continuous CVR use is higher than those reported by OC users; thus, the risk: benefit ratio
      of this approach needs careful assessment.

      Pregnancy is also an independent risk for HIV acquisition and transmission, when acquisition
      confers high rates of perinatal transmission. However, systemic depot progesterone, commonly
      used worldwide, may independently increase risk of HIV acquisition and transmission.
      Increased HIV risk related to hormonal contraceptive use would be of global public health
      importance, given the large number of women using such methods. In a recent technical
      report, the World Health Organization noted that &quot;expansion of contraceptive method mix and
      further research on the relationship between hormonal contraception and HIV infection is
      essential.&quot;

      For all of these reasons, then, a careful study of the microbiological, clinical, and
      immunologic benefits of the CVR is a high scientific and public health priority.
