  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about a new bowel preparation that uses food to clean
      the colon.

      In order to learn about this new food preparation, some people in this study will get the
      food preparation, and others will get the standard liquid bowel preparation.

      Patients will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to one of five groups:

      Group 1 - Menu A Meal Kit - contains bars, shakes, soup, and a rice bowl Group 2 - Menu B
      Meal Kit - contains bars, shakes, soup, and a rice bowl Group 3 - Menu C Meal Kit - contains
      bars and shakes Group 4 - MoviPrep Group 5 - NuLYTELY

      The purpose of this Phase 2 formulation screening/proof of concept study is to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of up to 3 ECP-019 formulations/dosing regimens
      comprising a PEG 3350 Colon Prep Kit, containing electrolytes provided by the foods, in 3
      formulations/ dosing regimens as compared to 2 comparators in a Phase 2 study.
