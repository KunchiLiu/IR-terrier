  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to fifty (50) children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) aged 4 to Ë‚18 years at
      time of enrolment will be selected for inclusion in the study. The target is to obtain
      treatment response and user-experience data following use of AMG504-1 in treating episodes
      of hypoglycemia.

    <textblock>
      This study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of intranasal (IN) glucagon administered
      under clinical use conditions in treating episodes of hypoglycemia in persons with T1D.

      This study also aims to assess the ease with which caregivers can administer the
      experimental medication in treatment of hypoglycemic events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Availability for the entire study period.

          -  Motivated Child/Adolescent with diabetes (C/AWD) and caregiver(s) and absence of
             intellectual problems likely to limit the validity of consent to participate in the
             study or the compliance with protocol requirements; ability to cooperate adequately;
             ability to understand and observe the instructions of the qualified investigator or
             designee.

          -  C/AWD lives with one or more caregivers who are available to administer the glucagon
             in case of an episode of severe or moderate hypoglycemia.

          -  Male or female C/AWD with a history of type 1 diabetes &gt;1 year.

          -  C/AWD aged of at least 4 years of age but less than 18 years.

          -  A female C/AWD must meet one of the following criteria:

             a) Participant is of child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the accepted
             contraceptive regimens throughout the entire duration of the study (from the
             pre-trial evaluation and enrollment visit until study completion). An acceptable
             method of contraception includes one of the following: (i) Abstinence from
             heterosexual intercourse (ii) Systemic contraceptives (birth control pills,
             injectable/implantable/ insertable hormonal birth control products, transdermal
             patch) (iii) Intrauterine device (iv) Condom with spermicide, OR b) Participant is of
             non-child-bearing potential, defined as a female who had had a hysterectomy or tubal
             ligation, is clinically considered infertile or has not yet reached menarche.

             laboratory evaluations.

          -  Willingness to adhere to the protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease, or any other
             conditions which in the judgment of the investigator could interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or could potentiate or
             predispose to undesired effects.

          -  Presence or history of pheochromocytoma (i.e. adrenal gland tumor) or insulinoma.

          -  Use of daily systemic beta-blockers, indomethacin, warfarin or anticholinergic drugs.

          -  Concomitant maintenance therapy with any drug that would influence the outcome of the
             trial, at the discretion of the Investigator and the Sponsor.

          -  Regular consumption of 3 or more units of alcoholic beverages per day.

          -  Current participation in another clinical trial, intent to enroll in another clinical
             trial during this clinical study or use of an Investigational Product (in another
             clinical trial) within the prior 30 days.
