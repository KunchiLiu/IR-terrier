  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A UCSF PI-initiated study with a primary goal to improve decision quality, anxiety, and
      uncertainty, thereby increasing appropriate uptake of active surveillance and reducing
      over-treatment of low-risk prostate cancer.

      This study involves: completion of questionnaires through the secure website; consultation
      by a health coach to aid men with prostate cancer in making informed treatment decision
      (personalized coaching session(s)), bio-specimen collection/analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A UCSF PI-initiated study which includes comprehensive decision support intervention
      incorporating clinical, lifestyle, tumor genomic, and germline gene variant data.

      The web and coaching intervention will: 1) summarize key clinical, lifestyle, and biomarker
      data elements, 2) communicate relative and absolute risks of upgrading/upstaging based on
      each of these elements, individually and in aggregate, and 3) provide tailored educational
      information for informed decision making on treatment options . A key aspect of the
      intervention will be provision of tiered coaching to the men prior to their physician visits
      to help them enter information accurately into the system, understand the results of the
      prediction model, document their questions for their physicians, and prepare them to make
      better-informed treatment decisions. UCSF research team will develop the decision support
      intervention in phases, initially using only CAPRA (validated clinical risk score), BMI
      (body mass index), and smoking data ; and then extend it to include information from genomic
      and genetic inputs as validation work progresses.

    <description>A health coach (members of the Patient Support Corps at the University of California San Francisco) will contact each subject individually to discuss his tailored/personalized web-portal report on his risk of aggressive disease and the pro/cons of treatment versus active surveillance.
The contact between subject and the health coaches will be done before subject's visit with his primary urologist. Subjects will be asked to complete different questionnaires on four different occasions: one at first visit to the interactive secure web portal; one before coach's call; one after the coaching (after the urologist visit), and one at 6 months. The questionnaire after subject's visit with the urologist includes discussion about their management choice, decision quality, anxiety and satisfaction with care.</description>
