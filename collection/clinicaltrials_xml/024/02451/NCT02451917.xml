    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common microvascular complications of
      diabetes mellitus, and it is the leading cause of end stage renal disease on developed
      countries. The CKD diagnosis and its progression require re-evaluation of hypoglycemic
      therapy and constant dosing adjustments, in order to optimize glycemic control and minimize
      its side effects. Long acting insulin analogs and its pharmacokinetics have not been studied
      through different stages of kidney disease and there is no consensus defining the
      appropriate dosing adjustment based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This research
      project will compare the glycemic response to intensive insulin treatment with NPH insulin
      and basal insulin analog (insulin glargine) in type 2 diabetes (DM 2) patients with CKD
      stages 3 and 4. Patients and methods - Inclusion Criteria: DM 2 patients with CKD secondary
      to diabetic nephropathy and GFR of 15-59 ml/min/1.73m². Exclusion Criteria: Patients with
      systemic neoplasia, HIV, CKD or nephropathy from other etiologies, severe psychiatric
      disorders and pregnant women. Study design: This study consists of a randomized, cross-over,
      open-label controlled clinical trial. Patients will be randomly divided into two groups:
      GROUP 1 - insulin analog glargine once a day and GROUP 2 - NPH human insulin, three
      applications per day, both group will be treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. The
      laboratory tests will be performed at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the study
      start. During routine medical appointments will be analyzed self- monitoring of capillary
      blood glucose (SMBG) and the hypoglycemia score. After six months the basal insulin will be
      changed, i.e. patients using NPH insulin will receive insulin glargine and patients on
      insulin glargine will be changed to NPH insulin. A CGMS will be carried out at 6 and 12
      months. Methodology: The metabolic profile will be evaluated throughout SMBG; biochemical,
      hormonal and hematological measurements; hypoglycemia score and CGMS. Statistical analysis
      will be performed using comparative descriptive analyzes, such as chi-square distribution,
      t-test and non-parametric tests. Analyze of data CGMS will include the area under the curve
      and the related statistic. Finally, logistic regression models will be adopted to evaluate
      the effect of the treatment on the several variables in question.

      This study consists of a randomized, cross-over, open-label controlled clinical trial.
      Randomized patients will be allocated alternately into two groups to receive the following
      therapies: GROUP 1 - insulin analog glargine once a day associated to insulin lispro at
      mealtime and GROUP 2 - NPH human insulin, three applications per day ( breakfast, lunch and
      bedtime) and insulin lispro at mealtime. Patients receiving insulin NPH plus insulin lispro
      will be oriented to mix both of them in the same syringe at breakfast and lunchtime. The
      laboratory tests will be performed at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the study
      start. During routine medical appointments the patient should bring the self- monitoring of
      capillary blood glucose (SMBG), eight points per day once a week, and hypoglycemia score.

      After six months of insulin therapy, a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) will be
      implemented for three days, and after that, the basal insulin changed i.e. patients using
      NPH insulin will receive insulin glargine and patients on insulin glargine will be changed
      to NPH insulin, both groups will keep insulin lispro before meals. A new CGMS will be
      carried out six months after therapy has been changed. Methodology: The metabolic profile
      will be evaluated throughout SMBG; biochemical, hormonal and hematological measurements;
      hypoglycemia score and CGMS (Medtronic/Northridge, CA). All randomized patients who use at
      least one dose of any study treatment will be considered in the Intent-to-treat (ITT)
      population. The initial plan is to randomize 40 patients, assuming a drop-out rate of 15%,
      to obtain a sample size of at least 34 randomized patients. .Statistical analysis will be
      performed using comparative descriptive analyzes, such as chi-square distribution, t-test
      and non-parametric tests. Analyze of data CGMS will include the area under the curve and the
      related statistic. Finally, logistic regression models will be adopted to evaluate the
      effect of the treatment on the several variables in question.
