      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Eligible subjects must have received initial cisplatin-based combination therapy, such as
      bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin (BEP), cisplatin-etoposide (EP),
      etoposide-ifosfamide-cisplatin (VIP), or similar regimens AND demonstrated progression
      following the administration of at least one 'salvage' regimen for advanced germ cell
      neoplasm, such as high dose chemotherapy, paclitaxel-ifosfamide-cisplatin (TIP), or
      vinblastine-ifosfamide-cisplatin (VeIP).

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks until progression or toxicity. Treatment will continue
      for up to 52 weeks in the absence of prohibitive toxicities or disease progression.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or
             obtained separately.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 within 14 days prior to registration for protocol
             therapy.

          -  Subjects must have histological or serological proof of metastatic germ cell neoplasm
             (gonadal or extragonadal primary) with disease not amenable to cure with either
             surgery or chemotherapy. Subjects with seminoma and non-seminoma are eligible, as are
             women with ovarian GCTs.

          -  Subjects must have evidence of recurrent or metastatic carcinoma by one or more of
             the following: the appearance of metastatic disease on chest x-ray or CT scan, or the
             appearance of rising tumor marker: AFP or beta-HCG. NOTE: If a rising tumor marker is
             the only evidence of progressive disease, at least 2 consecutive rising values at
             least one week apart are needed. Subjects with only evidence of disease as rising
             tumor marker AFP and beta-HCG will be provided alternate causes of increased serum
             levels of these markers are not present, such as cross reaction with luteinizing
             hormone (LH) (that can be tested if needed by testosterone suppression of LH),
             hepatitis, use of marijuana, or second primary tumor, etc.

          -  Subjects must have received initial cisplatin based combination therapy, such as
             bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin (BEP), cisplatin-etoposide (EP),
             etoposide-ifosfamide-cisplatin (VIP), or similar regimens AND demonstrated
             progression following the administration of at least one 'salvage' regimen for
             advanced germ cell neoplasm, such as high dose chemotherapy,
             paclitaxel-ifosfamide-cisplatin (TIP), or vinblastine-ifosfamide-cisplatin (VeIP).

          -  &quot;Failure&quot; of prior therapy is defined as: a &gt;25% increase in the products of
             perpendicular diameters of measurable tumor masses during prior therapy which are not
             amenable to surgical resection; the presence of new tumors which are not amenable to
             surgical resection; an increase in AFP or beta-hCG (two separate determinations at
             least one week apart are required if rising tumor markers are the only evidence of
             failure). NOTE: Subjects with clinically growing &quot;teratoma&quot; (normal declining tumor
             markers and radiographic or clinical progression) should be considered for surgery.

          -  Subjects are eligible after first line platinum based chemotherapy if their disease
             has relapsed and they have Primary Mediastinal Non Seminomatous Germ Cell tumor
             (PMNSGCT) or late relapse (&gt; 2 years) not amenable to surgical resection.

          -  Subjects must be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional
             biopsy of a tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6
             weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom
             newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g., inaccessible or subject safety
             concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the sponsor
             investigator

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the
             course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication .
             Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized
             or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          -  Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study
             therapy.

             (AE) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. NOTE 1:
             Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify
             for the study. NOTE 2: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered
