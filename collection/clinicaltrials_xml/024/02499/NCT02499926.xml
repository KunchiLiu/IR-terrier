    <textblock>
      Amino acids are the building blocks of the body's protein and are used to build muscle, body
      tissue, and to support the immune system. Amino acids play a crucial role in growth and
      development of our body, especially in young children. However, some rare genetic diseases
      do not allow for proper digestion of these amino acids and so protein needs to be restricted
      in the diet of people who live with these conditions. One such disorder of lysine (an amino
      acid) is called Pyridoxine Dependent Epilepsy(PDE) where lysine is restricted in the diet of
      children and adults who live with this condition. Although diet restrictions are common for
      such genetic disorders, some people find it hard to follow restrictions and so alternative
      treatment methods have been developed. One such alternative treatment methods is to provide
      an excess of a &quot;competitive&quot; amino acid, in this case, arginine to reduce or stop the
      digestion and/or absorption lysine. Our aim is to examine if arginine can reduce lysine
      digestion/absorption under conditions of normal lysine intake.

      Animal experiments have shown that the body's ability to absorb lysine from the diet and
      thereby accumulating in the brain can be altered by adding more of another &quot;competitive&quot;
      amino acid, in this case, arginine. This is because lysine and arginine share the same
      transport system in the body. In other words, the breakdown of lysine (lysine oxidation) can
      be altered by adding additional arginine to the diet. Such changes can be studied in human
      body with the use of stable isotopes. Stable isotope techniques may help us gain a better
      understanding of how arginine can affect lysine absorption in the body.

      Although, the arginine supplementation described above is primarily for PDE patients, the
      investigators propose to study this 13C- lysine tracer protocol in healthy adult men to
      generate pilot data.
