  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study is designed as a 2 part study consisting of a
      dose-escalation, safety run-in Part A and a dose-expansion Part B
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose-escalation Part A of this study will involve patients with advanced solid
      malignancies refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard of care regimen
      currently exists. Approximately 30 evaluable patients per treatment arm (A1 or A2) will be
      enrolled. A3 will test viability of alternate dosing schedule for AZD5069, A4/A5 will
      evaluate AZD9150/AZd5069 in fixed dose combination with MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in solid
      tumors. there may also be safety run in cohorts enrolled (A6/A7) in specific solid tumor
      types (breast and prostate cancer).

      Once the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) for each of the 2 agents (AZD9150/AZD5069)in
      combination with MEDI4736 have been identified or the maximum doses of each of the 2 agents
      in combination with MEDI4736 have been reached, the dose expansion Part B of the study would
      commence. It will be conducted in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic (RM) squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Between 68 and 124 eligible patients will be
      enrolled and will randomly assigned to 1 of the following 6 treatment arms:

        -  Treatment arm B1: AZD9150 in combination with MEDI4736 in patients with prior exposure
           to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies

        -  Treatment arm B2: AZD5069 in combination with MEDI4736 in patients with prior exposure
           to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies

        -  Treatment arm B3: AZD9150 in combination with MEDI4736 in patients with no prior
           exposure to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies

        -  Treatment arm B4: AZD5069 in combination with MEDI4736 in patients with no prior
           exposure to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies

        -  Treatment arm B5: AZD9150 alone in patients with no prior exposure to anti-PD-(L)1
           antibodies

        -  Treatment arm B6: AZD5069 alone in patients with no prior exposure to anti-PD-(L)1
           antibodies

             criteria Part A: Patients with clinically active brain metastases and prior exposure
