  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial aimed at evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of the combination of bendamustine and brentuximab vedotin as a
      first salvage therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma or PTCL. A
      total of 25 patients with PTCL, and 40 with Hodgkin's lymphoma are expected to be treated
      according to this treatment protocol. In the study, intravenous bendamustine will be
      administered at a dose of 90 mg/m2 on day 1 and 2 and brentuximab will be given
      intravenously at a total dose of 1.8 mg/kg on day 1 of each 21 days-based cycle, for 6
      cycles. All patients achieving a CR can be considered eligible to peripheral blood stem cell
      mobilization (to be performed with granulocytecolony stimulating factor alone) and may
      proceed to an ASCT at any time after cycle 4.
