  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to assess the potential of information structuring for
      improving discharge communication. Specifically, the investigators aim to examine the
      advantages of an information-structuring skills training for physicians (compared to an
      emotion skills training) on discharge communication and associated patient outcomes, such as
      patients' information recall and adherence to physician recommendations. The investigators
      hypothesize that patients receiving structured discharge information from their trained
      physicians will be able to recall more information and show higher adherence to
      recommendations relative to controls (i.e., patients receiving discharge information from
      doctors trained in emotion-handling skills).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with chest pain

          -  patients with abdominal pain

        We will use the following exclusion criteria concerning patients with chest pain:

          -  Patients younger than 18 years of age will not be recruited because of limited
             ability to provide informed consent.

          -  Patients with limited ability to communicate in German (the default language at the
             hospital) will not be recruited to exclude additional confounds related to language
             proficiency.

          -  Patients with dementia will not be recruited to avoid additional confounds arising
             from pathological memory deficits.

          -  Patients with increased troponin level, an indicator of myocardial infarction, will
             not be recruited to minimize stress on these more vulnerable patients.

          -  Patients with none of five cardiovascular risk factors (cvRF; smoking history,
             diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, age above 50 years, or family history of
             coronary heart disease) will not be recruited because chest pain symptoms in such
             patients are typically indicative of diagnoses unrelated to coronary heart disease,
             requiring a very different follow-up and health management recommendations (e.g., in
             the case of an anxiety disorder).

        We will use the following exclusion criteria concerning patients with abdominal pain:

          -  Patients younger than 18 years of age will not be recruited because of limited
             ability to provide informed consent.

          -  Patients with limited ability to communicate in German (the default language at the
             hospital) will not be recruited to exclude additional confounds related to language
             proficiency.

          -  Patients with dementia will not be recruited to avoid additional confounds arising
             from pathological memory deficits.
