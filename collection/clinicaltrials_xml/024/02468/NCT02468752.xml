      The primary objective of this study is to assess venous gas emboli load post diving when
      breathing normobaric oxygen compared to air.

      The secondary objectives are

        -  Assessment of DCS frequency

        -  Comparison of TCD and TTD consistency in venous gas emboli measurements

        -  Inflammatory activity in blood post diving

      3.1 Overall study design and flow chart This is a prospective, double blinded, randomized
      and controlled, cross-over study in Sweden.

      The study will be performed in three different sets, each containing identical standardized
      dives. The dives include movement on depth. Dive-computers will be used.

      In each pair of dives 10-20 professional divers from the Swedish navy will perform
      no-decompression dives. If multiple dives are performed during one day, there will be an
      appropriate adjustment of dive depth and time, according to established Swedish navy
      standards. The gas used during the dives is compressed air.

      After surfacing the divers will breathe (15 L/min) either normobaric oxygen or normobaric
      air during 15-30 minutes, depending on study set. Both oxygen and air will be administered
      using a free-flowing mask. The content of the gas containers will be unknown to both divers
      and examining personnel.

      Immediately post dive the divers will be assessed using TTD, TTE or TCD to determine VGE
      load, time to VGE detection and VGE duration. In Set 3 measurements will be done after the
      second dive. The subjects will avoid strenuous activities during the examination period and
      between dives in Set 3.

      Signs of DCS will be actively sought. TTD measurements will be done every five min during
      the first 30 min, thereafter every 15 min during 90 min.

      TTE will be performed every 30 min, using an apical 4-chamber view. TCD measurements are
      done continuously.

      Set 1: 10-20 divers, divided into two equal groups (A and B). Dive to 42 msw during 10 min
      with a safety stop at five msw during three min. Five minutes post dive breathing of oxygen
      (group A) or air (group B) during 30 min. VGE load, time to VGE detection and VGE duration
      is recorded. Blood samples will be drawn pre dive and two hours post dive. After at least 48
      hours, the dive is repeated with switched gases between the groups.

      Set 2: 10-20 divers, divided into two equal groups (A and B). Dive to 42 msw during 10 min
      with a safety stop at five msw during three min. Five minutes post dive breathing of oxygen
      (group A) or air (group B) during 15 min. VGE load, time to VGE detection and VGE duration
      is recorded. Blood samples will be drawn pre dive and two hours post dive. After at least 48
      hours, the dive is repeated with switched gases between the groups.

      Set 3: 10-20 divers, divided into two equal groups (A and B). First a dive 42 msw during 10
      min with a safety stop at five msw during three min. Five minutes post dive breathing of
      oxygen (group A) or air (group B) during 30 min. After a surface interval of 150 min Mikael
      - rätt dykintervall...? there will be a second dive 33 msw during 12 min. VGE load, time to
      VGE detection and VGE duration after the second dive is recorded. After at least 48 hours,
      the two dives are repeated with switched gases between the groups. Blood samples will be
      drawn before the first dive and two hours after the second dive.

      AE including SAE will be recorded during the study. DCS may be considered either an AE or
      SAE depending on severity. Ongoing AE and SAE will be followed up.

      Any questions or concerns that arise related to the study protocol should be directed to the
      principle investigator.
