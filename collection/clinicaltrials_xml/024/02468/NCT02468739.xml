      Monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside (GM1) protect breast cancer patient from taxanes-related
      neurotoxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taxanes is a key agent in the treatment of breast cancer. However, peripheral neuropathy
      markedly limits the use of taxanes. There are no way to relieve or eliminate taxanes-related
      neurotoxicity. Monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside (GM1) present a role of neuroprotective
      properties. This multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess
      the efficacy of GM1 for preventing taxanes induced neurotoxicity in operable breast cancer
      patients who received taxanes-based adjuvant chemotherapy.

    <description>Toxicity was evaluated according to criteria of the National Cancer Institute (NCI-CTCAE) version 3. Grade 2 neurotoxicity was defined as moderate paresthesia or dysesthesia interfering with function, but not interfering with activities of daily living (ADL). Patients with painful paresthesia interfering with ADL were regarded as grade III. In addition to subjective assessment, a short, standardized neurologic examination including the testing of exteroceptive sensation in the hands and feet, and testing of proprioceptive sensation was done.</description>
