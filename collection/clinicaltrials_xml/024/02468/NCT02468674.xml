  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this extension study is to: 1) evaluate the durability of effect on skeletal
      muscle mass, strength and physical function upon discontinuation of treatment received in
      the core study and 2) evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of an
      additional 24 weeks of bimagrumab treatment in older patients with sarcopenia who previously
      received 24 weeks of treatment in the core study.

      The parallel group, placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal design will allow an unbiased
      comparison of the duration of effect upon withdrawal from 3 different dose regimens of
      bimagrumab and placebo on changes in muscle quantity and patient physical function in a
      population of older adults with sarcopenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the durability of effect of bimagrumab (BYM) by comparing
      withdrawal of BYM (i.e., BYM/placebo PBO switch) treatment with continued BYM administration
      every 4 weeks for 24 additional weeks of treatment (following participation in the core
      study) in older adults with sarcopenia as measured by change from week 25 to week 49 on the
      6MWT. The secondary objectives are: - To evaluate the effect of BYM given intravenously
      every 4 weeks for 24 additional weeks of treatment (following completion of 24 weeks of
      treatment in the core study) on safety and tolerability as assessed by measures such as
      vital signs, clinical laboratory variables, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and adverse
      events as compared to treatment with PBO in older adults with sarcopenia. - To evaluate the
      durability of effect of BYM by comparing withdrawal of BYM (i.e. BYM/PBO switch) treatment
      with continued BYM administration every 4 weeks for 24 additional weeks of treatment
      (following completion of 24 weeks of treatment in the core study) in older adults with
      sarcopenia as measured by change from week 25 to week 49 on: - performance on the Short
      Physical Performance Battery score mobility as measured in gait speed (GS measured as a
      component of the SPPB) over 4 meters - total lean body mass and appendicular skeletal muscle
      index measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry

          -  Any medical condition or laboratory finding, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator prevents the subject from continuing participation in the study, may
             interfere with participation in the study, might confound the results of the study,
             or pose an additional safety risk to the subject in administering bimagrumab

          -  Concurrent enrollment in a clinical trial involving an investigational drug or off-
             label use of a drug, or any other type of medical research judged to be
