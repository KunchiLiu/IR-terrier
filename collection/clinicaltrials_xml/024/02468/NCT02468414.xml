      The objectives of this study are to assess safety and to evaluate the biologic activity of
      TARGTEPO treatment in Peritoneal Dialysis patients

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label study. Each patient will be administered with a targeted dose
      of EPO delivered via TARGTEPO.

      The targeted doses will be determined according to 2 cohorts as follows: Group A (18-25
      IU/Kg/day), Group B (35-45 IU/Kg/day). The objective is to evaluate safety and biologic
      activity of TARGTEPO treatment when maintaining Hb levels within the target range of 9-12
      g/dl. Biological activity assessments will include duration of TARGTEPO secretion as
      measured by serum EPO levels above baseline.
