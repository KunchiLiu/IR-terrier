    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of OTX-DP as a sustained release drug (dexamethasone,
      0.4mg) depot when placed in the canaliculus of the eyelid in subjects who exhibit signs and
      symptoms of dry eye disease.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, parallel-arm, bilateral, double-masked,
      vehicle controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OTX-DP compared to the
      Placebo Vehicle (PV) for the treatment of subjects exhibiting signs and symptoms of dry eye
      disease. This is a serial phase trial. Initially, the effect of the PV will be established
      during a 6-week Punctum Plug Only Phase. This will establish baseline data to be used for
      analysis of the Treatment Phase where subjects will be randomized to the study drug (OTX-DP)
      or the placebo control (PV). Up to forty (40) subjects and eighty (80) eyes, who meet all
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be asked to participate in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a known history (within the past 6 months) of dry eye disease

          -  Has a corrected LogMAR VA ≤ 0.3 (20/40 Snellen or better) in each eye as assessed at
             the Screening Visit

          -  Punctum Plug Only Phase: Minimal Cumulative (five areas) Corneal Fluorescein Staining
             Score of 8 as assessed at the Screening Visit in each eye

          -  Treatment Phase: Minimal Cumulative (five areas) Corneal Fluorescein Staining Score
             of 5 as assessed on Day 1 (plug insertion) of the Treatment Phase in each eye

          -  Has an OSDI score of ≥18 as assessed at the Screening Visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any history of intraocular inflammation or its presence during the screening or
             insertion slit lamp examination in either eye

          -  Active or a history of chronic/recurrent ocular or systemic disease that is
             uncontrolled and will likely affect the study outcomes (e.g. iritis, uveitis,

             to Visit 1 and no change in the medication during the study period is anticipated);
             Periocular injection of any corticosteroid solution - 3 months; Corticosteroid
             intra-vitreal depot injection in either eye - 3 months; Ozurdex in either eye - 9
             months; Retisert in either eye - 40 months; Topical ocular corticosteroid - 2 weeks;

          -  Has uncontrolled Glaucoma or is on medications to treat glaucoma

          -  Has ocular hypertension (Normalized IOP of ≥ 22 mmHg), is on medications to treat
             ocular hypertension or has a history of IOP spikes in either eye

          -  Active or history of chronic or recurrent inflammatory eye disease (e.g. iritis,
             uveitis)

          -  Active Epiphora

          -  Requires use of any topical ophthalmic solutions other than non-preserved OTC Tears
