      This study is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, proof of concept study patients
      with post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) of the knee. Approximately 124 eligible patients
      will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups (1:1) and treated with a single
      intra-articular (IA) injection of:

        -  40 mg of FX006

        -  40 mg of Kenalog®-40 (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, USP)

      Each prospective patient will undergo a screening evaluation to confirm a diagnosis of PTOA
      of the knee and concurrence with all other eligibility criteria. Patients will be treated on
      Day 1 (Baseline) and will return to the clinic at Weeks 4, 8 and 12 for evaluation of safety
      and efficacy.
