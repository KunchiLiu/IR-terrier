  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This surgery involves the use of a finger joint replacement device for treatment of patients
      with certain kinds of arthritis (osteo - arthritis or post traumatic arthritis) and who
      expect to place their hands in heavy loading situations, or patients needing revision of a
      failed implant placed in the PIP joint. A joint replacement surgery is an operation where
      the arthritic joint is removed and a metal and plastic joint is inserted to replace the
      natural joint. The surgery is expected to last about 2 hours. The procedure is done in the
      operating room and requires general anesthesia or an axillary block. (General anesthesia
      affects the entire body and is accompanied by a loss of consciousness. An axillary block
      results in anesthesia of the hand and forearm only. A tourniquet is applied to the arm to
      prevent bleeding during the surgery.)
