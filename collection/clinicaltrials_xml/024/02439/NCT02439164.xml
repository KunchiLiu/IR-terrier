  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation in the operating room, the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and the Intensive Care Unit is
      common and often necessary for patients with intracranial brain tumor. Repeated neurological
      function assessments is needed in those locations, especially in patients with tumors in or
      near eloquent regions, this is to monitor their neurologic performance to determine if there
      are alterations that require treatment. Some slowly infiltrative low-grade gliomas near
      eloquent regions do not show any detectable neurologic deficits, perhaps from
      reorganization, but with sedation by some sedatives such as benzodiazepine midazolam and
      anesthetic hypnotic propofol, the disease may seem much worse resulting in inappropriately
      aggressive treatment. This may be especially problematic in patients undergoing awake
      craniotomy for tumors in eloquent regions.

      This is a single-center perspective case-control study. Patients will be mildly sedated to
      keep them responsive and cooperative. Motor and sensory function will be evaluated before
      and after mild sedation. Specific benzodiazepine antagonist will be used if sedated by
      midazolam.

      The purpose of this study is to observe if commonly used benzodiazepine midazolam,
      anesthetic hypnotic propofol, and Î±-2 agonist dexmedetomidine exacerbate or unmask motor and
      sensory function in patients with intracranial eloquent area gliomas.

      Hypothesis:

      mild sedation can unmasks or exacerbate motor and sensory deficits in patients with eloquent
      area glioma but not in non-neurosurgical patients/healthy volunteers. If the neurologic
      deficits induced by benzodiazepine agonist, then can be reversed by flumazenil.
