      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of different doses of intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) (1g/kg once, 1g/kg twice, 2g/kg once) for Kawasaki disease (KD) in a
      multicentre, prospective,randomised trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness recognized most often in young children.
      Coronary abnormality is the most serious complication preventable with intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration. Various treatment regimens of IVIG have been
      reported.The optimal administrative doses of IVIG deserves more observations.We will conduct
      a multicenter, randomized, prospective trial to determine the effect of different doses of
      IVIG (1g/kg once, 1g/kg twice, 2g/kg once) for Kawasaki disease. The KD children will be
      randomly assigned to three groups and receive three doses of IVIG (1g/kg once, 1g/kg twice,
      2g/kg once). Patient age, gender, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), red blood cell specific volume (HCT) ,
      serum albumin, the fever days,and the cost of hospital stay will be analyzed among the three
      groups. All the patients will be detected the 6 genes polymorphisms including
      ITPKC、CASP3、HLA、BLK、FCGR2A and CD40. The final outcome is the rates of IVIG unresponsiveness
      and the incidence of coronary artery lesions .
