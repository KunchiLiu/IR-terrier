  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) treatment protocol has been validated in the setting
      of cystic fibrosis (CF). This trial tests the feasibility of a standardized treatment
      algorithm for confirmed disease by either M. avium complex or the M. abscessus complex that
      is also based on forthcoming guidelines from the CF Foundation (CFF) and the European CF
      Society (ECFS). The primary endpoint is 12 months of negative NTM cultures following
      completion of therapy.

      The investigators' near-term goal is to validate both protocols by extending the trial to 5
      additional CF Centers. The long-term goal is to make the validated protocols available to
      the entire CFF Care Center Network.
