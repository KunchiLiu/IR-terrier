      Background:

      - Medical problems and treatments can cause stress in some people. Researchers want to learn
      more about how to measure distress in young people with medical illnesses. A screening tool
      called Checking In will be developed in order to help researchers find ways to identify
      concerns and stresses common to this group.

      Objective:

      - To create a screening tool that will help health care providers identify psychological and
      social distress in young people with serious illnesses.

      Eligibility:

      - Outpatient youth ages 8 21 who are enrolled on a research protocol at the NIH at the time
      of the study.

      Design:

        -  Phase 1 participants will complete a paper-and-pencil version of Checking In. It asks
           about mood, pain, fatigue, peer relationships, and sleep. During this phase,
           participants will be asked about the wording of the questions in Checking In. They will
           also talk about what they thought of the questions and if they understood them.

        -  Phase 2 will not involve participant enrollment. During this phase the researchers will
           be working with technologists to develop the software for an electronic version of
           Checking In.

        -  Phase 3 participants will complete an electronic version of Checking In. Researchers
           will ask questions about the ease or difficulty of using an electronic screen.

        -  Phase 4 participants and one of their caregivers will complete an electronic version of
           Checking In. They will also complete other questionnaires related to mood, pain
           fatigue, peer relationships and sleep. They will be asked their thoughts about using
           Checking In. On the same day, their NIH doctor will get summary data about their
           questionnaire answers. The doctor will also provide feedback about the summary form.

        -  Researchers will compare data from Checking In with data from the other questionnaires.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to develop and implement Checking In, a brief and interactive
      screening measure of distress, designed to identify emotional, physical, social, practical
      and spiritual concerns of pediatric patients. An accompanying provider summary sheet that
      delineates patient report of distress, will allow providers to triage services to patients
      and their families, thereby enhancing patient quality of life throughout the treatment
      trajectory.

      Objective 1: The primary objective of this protocol is to develop a brief electronic
      screening tool, Checking In, which would assist clinicians in assessing the presence of
      psychological distress in children and adolescents with cancer and other serious medical
      illnesses. The electronic scale, once developed, will meet all of the NIH requirements for
      gathering and storing electronic data.

      In order to accomplish this aim, the researchers will conduct cognitive interviews with 60
      pediatric patients in order to refine the questions and phrasing of items on Checking In.
      The results from this phase of the study of will be used to develop the electronic screen,
      which will be used to accomplish the remaining aims.

      Objective 2: To assess the concurrent validity (i.e. the extent to which a test correlates
      with other previously validated measures of similar constructs) of Checking In as compared
      to validated measures of psychological symptoms (i.e. depression, anxiety, pain and fatigue)
      in patients with pediatric cancer, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) or Primary Immune
      Deficiencies (PIDs).

      Objective 3: To assess the feasibility of administering Checking In to pediatric patients
      and their caregivers. Researchers who administer Checking In will complete a brief
      questionnaire rating the feasibility of administration and all barriers encountered. These
      finding will help guide the further refinement of the electronic screening tool.

      Objective 4: To evaluate the usefulness of the Checking In summary report. Providers will
      complete a survey evaluating the usefulness of the summary report to indicate whether: 1)
      the report provided useful information, 2) the information was presented in a user-friendly
      manner, and 3) the summary report impacted care planning for the child.

      Objective 5: Another objective of this study is to assess the acceptability of completing
      the Checking In screening tool among patients with cancer and other serious illnesses and
      their primary caregivers. This aim will be achieved by having the patients and their
      caregivers answer a brief questionnaire that assesses how acceptable they found Checking In
      to complete.

      Secondary Objective 1: To assess the burden and benefits of completing Checking In.

      Secondary Objective 2: To assess the inter-rater reliability of Checking In by comparing
      ratings of the patient s distress given by the patient and the primary caregiver.

      -Study Population:

      This study is taking place at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All outpatients, ages
      8-21, enrolled in a research study either at the Pediatric Clinic or the Primary Immune
      Deficiency Clinic at the NIH with a diagnosis of pediatric cancer, NF-1 or PIDs will be
      invited to participate in this study.

      -Design:

      The initial phase of this study will consist of the researchers conducting cognitive
      interviews with 60 patients in order to refine the questions and phrasing of items on
      Checking In. Preliminary questions for Checking In were derived and modified from the PI s
      previous protocol on the Distress Thermometer. During this first phase, a paper and pencil
      version of Checking In will be used.

      Results of this initial phase will be used in phase 2 to develop the electronic version of
      Checking In. A bid will be conducted through the NIH to hire a technology development group
      who will build the Checking In application. This will include the interface development,
      graphics, and ability for the application to generate a printout summary report.
      De-identified data from both phase 1 and the physician survey will be utilized to guide the
      application development.

      During phase 3, the electronic version of Checking In will be pilot tested. Twenty-five
      patients will be enrolled for this phase. Patients will be given a tablet and asked to
      complete Checking In. A researcher will be present to ensure that the application runs
      smoothly and that the interface is feasible.

      Once the electronic version of Checking In is finalized, researchers will begin phase 4 of
      the study. During phase 4, each patient will complete a brief electronic self-report
      distress scale, Checking In, and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pain, and
      fatigue. Additionally, all participants will be asked to assess the benefits and burdens of
      Checking In.

      Primary caregivers will rate their child s level of distress using Checking In, as well as
      complete measures assessing their child s pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Caregivers
      will also be asked questions that assess the benefits and burdens of Checking In.

      Both patients and primary caregivers will assess the acceptability of completing Checking
      In. Medical providers will rate the usefulness of the Checking In summary report, as well as
      provide a performance rating of the patient using Lansky/Karnofsky Performance status
      scores. Additionally, data collectors will assess the feasibility of administering Checking
      In in a pediatric outpatient clinic.

      -Outcome Measures

      Measures include Checking In; PROMIS measures of Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Pain
      Intensity, Pain Interference, Sleep Disturbance and Peer Relationships; an Acceptability and
      Feasibility scale for completion of Checking In; and the Benefit Burden Scale.
