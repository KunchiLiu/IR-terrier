  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will investigate the accuracy and performance of a new sensor for continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGM), the (new generation) Enlite, CE-marked in 2013, in conjunction
      with the new Medtronic 640G system components.

      To evaluate the accuracy and performance of the new generation Enlite sensor. This is a
      postmarket, interventional, open-label, non-randomized, single center clinical research
      trial.

      The trial will adopt a prospective single-sample design using the Yellow Spring Instruments
      (YSI) plasma glucose reference sampling procedure in the clinic and self-monitoring of blood
      glucose (SMBG) plasma glucose reference sampling procedure at home.

      The trial will investigate the accuracy and performance (i.e. the life-time) of a new sensor
      for CGM, the (new generation) Enlite glucose sensor, CE-marked in 2013, in conjunction with
      the new Medtronic 640G system components. Accuracy and life-time of the sensor are important
      parameters contributing to the safety of patients and patient acceptance of this still
      fairly new technology.

      The current trial investigates the accuracy of the new sensor in conjunction with the new
      640G system components both in the clinic and at home. This enables us to assess the sensor
      accuracy in a well-controlled environment using a highly accurate laboratory glucose
      analyzer as reference as well as sensor accuracy during real-life conditions using a blood
      glucose meter as reference analyzer.

      The data gathered in this trial will help to understand the effect of technological
      advancements made and can guide future development of glucose sensor for continuous glucose
      monitoring.

    <measure>A correlation between the sensor and reference plasma glucose values will be performed</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>A linear model, in which reference plasma glucose values are predicted by sensor values, using a repeated measures model, will be performed. The models solution will provide the intercept and slope. An intercept of 0, along with a slope of 1, would indicate the absence of bias in predicting reference plasma glucose values from sensor readings.</description>

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>All analysis performed using the Clarke Error Grid comparing the paired sensor and YSI reference glucose values will be duplicated using the Continuous Error Grid [Kovatchev et al, 2004] and the Consensus Error Grid [Parkes et al, 2000].</description>

    <measure>Comparison of CGM performance to reference plasma glucose values under conditions leadings to alert</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 640G Pump includes the ability to set alert thresholds (including the predictive alert) for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. The alert will be triggered when the sensor BG value reaches the threshold glucose value. Predictive alerts will be evaluated by using the predicted sensor BG value based on current sensor BG and sensor BG readings within the previous 30 minutes, that the glucose level would soon reach the threshold.</description>

    <description>The trial has an open label design with a glucose sensor intervention. Only 1 sensor system is used in the trial (no comparator).
As all subjects will receive identical devices and undergo the same experimental procedures, no randomization will be performed. Furthermore, neither subjects nor clinical staff will be blinded to the sensor readings, as knowing the sensor glucose readings will not affect the accuracy endpoint.</description>

    <description>This is a postmarket, interventional, open-label, non-randomized, single center clinical research trial. The trial will adopt a prospective single-sample design using the Yellow Spring Instruments (YSI) plasma glucose reference sampling procedure in the clinic and selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) plasma glucose reference sampling procedure at home. The trial will consist of 6 visits to the investigational site: a visit for informed consent procedures (Visit 0), a screening visit (Visit 1), 3 study visits (Visit 2-4) and a final examination (Visit 5).</description>
