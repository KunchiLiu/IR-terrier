  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open, multicenter study that will enroll patients with clinical signs
      of stroke in the prehospital setting. A follow-up microwave measurement will be performed by
      the hospital investigator for the patients admitted to the Stroke Unit at Sahlgrenska
      University Hospital in conjunction with a CT scan, if this is performed as part of the
      standard of care within 48 hours of stroke onset. The study assesses the diagnostic
      capability, measurement performance, safety and usability of Strokefinder MD100 in a
      prehospital environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open, multicenter study that will enroll patients with clinical signs
      of stroke in the prehospital setting.

      When the dispatch center (in Sweden SOS Alarm 112) decides to dispatch an ambulance with
      highest priority (1, with lights/sirens active) for a suspected case of stroke, a research
      nurse staffed single responder vehicle equipped with Strokefinder MD100 will be dispatched
      to the scene, if deemed possible to reach the site ahead of the first ambulance. The
      research nurse will evaluate if the patient fulfills all of the inclusion criteria and none
      of the exclusion criteria, on delegation from the prehospital investigator. If confirmed to
      be suitable for the study the patient is asked about verbal informed consent. If the answer
      is affirmative the microwave measurement will be performed with the patient lying on the
      ambulance stretcher or another suitable surface. The procedure will take less than five
      minutes (the duration of the actual measurement is &lt; 1 minute) and will not interfere with
      the patient's standard of care during transport or at the receiving hospital. Written
      informed consent is acquired by the hospital investigator, as soon as possible after the
      acute phase of care is completed.

      A follow-up microwave measurement will be performed by the hospital investigator for the
      patients admitted to the Stroke Unit at Sahlgrenska University Hospital/Sahlgrenska in
      conjunction with a Computed Tomography (CT) scan, if this is performed as part of the
      standard of care within 48 hours of stroke onset.

      The measurement data will be evaluated for the presence of signal artifacts. The diagnostic
      ability of the device will be evaluated using a leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV)
      method with the CT diagnosis as ground truth. The time from arrival at patient side to
      completion of measurement procedure, and the duration for the measurement procedure itself,
      will be measured.

      Safety will be evaluated throughout the study, and a safety follow-up will be performed by
      the hospital investigator 24 hours after the last microwave measurement is finalized. No
      further follow-up of patients is planned.
