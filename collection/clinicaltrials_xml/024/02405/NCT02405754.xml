  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study, designed to be conducted at a single-center in the US. The
      study will conduct a one-time data abstraction from approximately 500 patient medical charts
      who received Corus CAD testing, by order of the Principal Investigator. Limited demographic
      data and patient data pertaining to cardiology referral or advanced diagnostic testing will
      be collected. All data will be collected anonymously.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Though the diagnostic properties of Corus CAD have been evaluated in previous observational
      studies, there are limited data regarding how primary care clinicians are using the results
      of the test in the care and management of patients with symptoms suggestive of angina in the
      African-America patient population. This retrospective study is designed to examine the
      relationship between the Corus CAD score and patterns of care regarding cardiology referral
      or further cardiac diagnostic testing in an African-American patient population
      single-center site.

      This is a retrospective study, designed to be conducted at a single-center in the US. The
      study will conduct a one-time data abstraction from approximately 500 patient medical charts
      who received Corus CAD testing, by order of the Principal Investigator. Limited demographic
      data and patient data pertaining to cardiology referral or advanced diagnostic testing will
      be collected. All data will be collected anonymously. IRB approval will be requested with a
      waiver of informed consent, as no identifying information will be collected.

      This retrospective study is designed to understand the patterns of care, including referrals
      for cardiac care and testing (including referrals to a cardiologist, exercise stress
      testing, cardiac computerized tomography angiography (CCTA), invasive cardiac angiography
      (ICA)) within an African-American patient population.
