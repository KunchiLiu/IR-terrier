      The aim of this study was to evaluate the temporal artery thermometer by comparing temporal
      artery and axillary thermometer temperature measurements with rectal thermometer temperature
      measurements in neonatal patients. The investigators measured temporal artery, axillary, and
      rectal temperatures of 49 infants. Temporal artery temperature was measured using an
      infrared temporal artery thermometer, and the results with this device were compared with
      axillary temperature (clinical standard) and rectal temperature (gold standard). The
      difference between rectal and temporal artery temperatures was compared with the difference
      between rectal and axillary temperatures for each infant, and the data were analyzed based
      on weight, postmenstrual age and bed type - open crib or incubator.
