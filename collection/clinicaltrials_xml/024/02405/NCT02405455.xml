  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical incompetence is a relatively complex disorder from the diagnostic and therapeutic
      point of view. Despite established diagnostic criteria, it is not easy for the specialist in
      clinical practice to establish limits in complicated cases. Cervical cerclage is the
      technique classically used to avoid pregnancy loss or preterm birth in patients with
      cervical incompetence. Although numerous studies support its efficacy, it remains a
      controversial method, given what the technique implies for the clinician and patient.
      Difficulties and potential risks of its insertion and inconveniences and side effects for
      the patient still exist. The recently published promising results of the use of the pessary
      to prevent preterm birth in women with a short cervix offer new prospectives for the
      management of prematurity prevention. The short learning curve, good cost-effectiveness and,
      most importantly, low side effects, render the pessary a tool of great potential.

      Hypothesis

      To ascertain whether the cervical pessary can reduce the preterm delivery rate to below 37
      weeks in women with cervical incompetence, at least from 33.5% to 26.6%, as does cervical
      cerclage.

      Objectives

      The main aim is to evaluate the results of the cervical pessary compared with those of
      cerclage in patients diagnosed with cervical incompetence. Secondary aims will include
      assessment of morbility produced by the pessary compared with cerclage and acertain the
      economic impact of pessary use in these patients.

      Methods

      Longitudinal, prospective, randomised pilot study.

      Inclusion criteria

        -  Singleton pregnancy

        -  12+0 - 25+6 weeks of gestation

        -  Minimum age: 18 years

        -  History of 3 or more late miscarriages, 3 or more premature births, 3 or more late
           miscarriages or premature births altogether or history of one or more preterm births or
           pregnancy losses in the second trimester and cervical length &lt; 25mm before 25+6 weeks.

      Sample size: 60 women, 30 in the pessary group and 30 in the cerclage group. Randomisation
      will be made by an electronic database especially designed for it at 1:1.

      The primary outcome is delivery before 34 weeks. Secondary outcomes are preterm birth rate
      before 28 and 37 weeks, associated maternal side effects, maternal and foetal complications
      and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

    <description>The pessary will be inserted after randomization, between 12+0 - 25+6 weeks of gestation.
This procedure does not need anaesthesia and it does not need to be done in a surgery room.
During the following explorations the correct placement of the pessary is assessed, and if it does not, it can be easily adjusted.
The pessary will be removed at 37 weeks of gestation, or before if any unexpected event occurs.</description>
