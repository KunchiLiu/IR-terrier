    <textblock>
      The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) represents a major advance for
      hematological patients, enabling the effective delivery of chemotherapy and/or blood
      products particularly for prolonged infusions or in situation of difficult venous access. In
      modern medical practice their use has increased rapidly for several reasons, including ease
      of insertion, many uses (e.g., drug administration and venous access), perceived safety, and
      cost-effectiveness compared with other central venous catheters (CVCs).

      The use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) represents a major advance for
      hematological patients, enabling the effective delivery of chemotherapy and/or blood
      products particularly for prolonged infusions or in situation of difficult venous access. In
      modern medical practice their use has increased rapidly for several reasons, including ease
      of insertion, many uses (e.g., drug administration and venous access), perceived safety, and
      cost-effectiveness compared with other central venous catheters (CVCs). Despite these
      benefits, PICCs are associated with deep vein thrombosis of the arm and pulmonary embolism.
      These complications, which are often called venous thromboembolism, are important because
      they not only complicate and interrupt treatment, but also increase cost, morbidity and
      mortality. Despite this effect, the burden and risk of PICC-related venous thromboembolism
      is uncertain and clinicians have scarce evidence on which to base choice of vascular access.
      Evidence to choose one vascular access over the other is lacking in literature, in
      particular for patients affected by haematological malignancies, in which chemotherapy is
      more likely to cause myelosuppression, with a major risk of bloodstream infections.
      Furthermore, the precise incidence and the risk of PICC-related venous thromboembolism
      relative to that of other CVCs is unknown. An understanding of this risk in the context of
      growing PICC use is an important cost and patients safety questions. Up to now, no
      systematic review has been done to investigate these questions.

    <description>Occurrence of any complication, major complications, defined as any complication requiring vascular access removal, catheter-related thrombosis requiring anti-coagulation, pneumothorax, accidental complete catheter dislodgement, catheter occlusion or disruption that rendered the catheter ineffective and failure of catheter insertion (Catheter-related thrombosis will be diagnosed by ultrasound doppler of the vein on presentations with clinical signs of venous thrombosis), or minor complications (insertion site complication treated conservatively (such as pain or pruritus), partial catheter dislodgement and occlusion which did not render the catheter ineffective), catheter dwell time and time from randomization to catheter insertion. A questionnaire covering functional status, sleep and hygiene disturbance will be given to assess patients'quality of life.</description>
