      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase II study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of CTL019 in pediatric patients with r/r B-cell ALL. The study will have the
      following sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation &amp;
      Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and Primary Follow-up, Secondary Follow-up (if
      applicable) and Survival Follow-up. The total duration of the study is 5 years from CTL019
      cell infusion.

             methods of contraception for a period of 1 year after the CTL019 infusion. Highly
             effective contraception methods include:

               1. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               2. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study
                  treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
                  the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               3. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients
                  on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient.

               4. BOTH of the following forms of contraception must be utilized:

                    -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy
                       (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception.

                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository

               5. Use of IUDs are excluded due to increased risks of infection and bleeding in
                  this population.

               6. In case of use of oral contraception, women must be stable on the same pill for
                  a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

                  Women who are not of reproductive potential (defined as either &lt;11 years of age,
                  Tanner Stage 1, post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have
                  undergone hysterectomy, salpingotomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy) are
                  eligible without requiring the use of contraception. Acceptable documentation
                  includes written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's
                  staff of one of the following:

               1. Demographics show age &lt;11

               2. Physical examination indicates Tanner Stage 1

               3. Physician report/letter

               4. Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record

               5. Discharge summary

               6. Follicle stimulating hormone measurement elevated into the menopausal range

          -  The following medications are excluded:

               1. Steroids: Therapeutic doses of steroids must be stopped &gt; 72 hours prior to
                  CTL019 infusion. However, the following physiological replacement doses of
                  steroids are allowed:

                  &lt; 12 mg/m2/day hydrocortisone or equivalent

               2. Allogeneic cellular therapy: Any donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) must be
                  completed &gt; 6 weeks prior to CTL019 infusion

               3. GVHD therapies: Any drug used for GVHD must be stopped &gt; 4 weeks prior to CTL019
                  infusion (e.g. calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate or other chemotherapy drugs,
                  mycophenolyate, rapamycin, thalidomide, or immunosuppressive antibodies such as
                  anti-CD20 (rituximab), anti-TNF, anti-IL6 or anti-IL6R)

               4. Chemotherapy:

                  The following drugs must be stopped &gt; 1 week prior to CTL019 infusion and should
                  not be administered concomitantly or following lymphodepleting chemotherapy:
                  hydroxyurea, vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, methotrexate &lt; 25
                  mg/m2, cytosine arabinoside &lt; 100 mg/m2/day, asparaginase (non-pegylated)

                  The following drugs must be stopped &gt;2 weeks prior to CTL019 infusion:

                  salvage chemotherapy (e.g. clofarabine, cytosine arabinoside &gt; 100 mg/m2,
                  anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide), excluding the required lymphodepleting
                  chemotherapy drugs Pegylated-asparaginase must be stopped &gt; 4 weeks prior to
                  CTL019 infusion

               5. CNS disease prophylaxis:

                  CNS prophylaxis treatment must be stopped &gt; 1 week prior to CTL019 infusion
                  (e.g. intrathecal methotrexate)

          -  Anti T-cell therapy: Administration of any T cell or toxic agent is strongly
             discouraged since residual lytic levels may destroy the infused CTL019 cell or
             prevent their in vivo expansion.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion may apply.
