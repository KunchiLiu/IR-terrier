  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuation of antipsychotic drug treatment for at least 12 months after remission of the
      first psychotic episode represents the gold clinical standard, and it is recommended by all
      international treatment guidelines. Numerous studies have shown that the risk of relapse is
      significantly increased, if drug treatment is terminated prematurely. However, only a
      minority of patients achieve functional remission, even if they fully comply with treatment.
      Long-term adverse effects of the currently available drugs, specifically brain grey matter
      loss and development of supersensitivity psychosis, might outweigh their benefits. Thus, the
      current standard of long-term maintenance antipsychotic treatment, which has the primary
      goal of relapse prevention, has to be questioned. Here the investigators hypothesise that
      intermittent antipsychotic treatment (targeted exclusively at positive symptoms) initiated
      after the first psychotic episode is associated with less regional and global brain (grey
      matter) volume loss over a period of twelve months than continuous antipsychotic treatment.
      Furthermore, the investigators hypothesise that this targeted treatment approach is
      associated with better functional outcome (fewer negative symptoms, better cognitive
      performance, better quality of life) than continuous antipsychotic treatment,although the
      latter is initially associated with fewer relapses.

      All patients with the first episode of schizophrenia admitted to a hospital participating in
      the consortium will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as soon as possible after
      admission. Ideally, this procedure is performed before initiation of antipsychotic treatment
      (benzodiazepines are allowed). If not possible for clinical reasons, antipsychotic treatment
      will be started and the MRI will be acquired within three days of initiation of drug
      treatment. The choice of the antipsychotic will be made by the treating physician. All
      approved antipsychotics are permitted, including first-generation antipsychotics such as
      haloperidol or flupenthixol. This is based on the recommendation of the British NICE
      guidelines: &quot;In nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1,801 participants
      with first-episode or early schizophrenia (including people with a recent onset of
      schizophrenia and people who have never been treated with antipsychotic medication), the
      evidence suggested there were no clinically significant differences in efficacy between the
      antipsychotic drugs examined.&quot; (NICE 2009, p. 105). However, since second-generation
      antipsychotics (SGA) are now considered first-line treatment for schizophrenia according to
      the German S3 guideline, it can be assumed that more than 80% of all patients will be
      treated with an SGA.

      As soon as positive symptoms are sufficiently controlled, medication will be completely
      tapered off within four weeks. Sufficient control of positive symptoms will defined as
      follows: &quot;delusions&quot; (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) item 1), &quot;hallucinatory
      behaviour&quot; (PANSS item 3), and &quot;suspiciousness/persecution&quot; (PANSS item 6) have to be
      &quot;absent&quot; or &quot;mild&quot; (scores 1 or 2). The PANSS Positive score (7 items) must not be above 18.
      Patients in the experimental group who will not reach remission according to this definition
      will be switched to another antipsychotic according to clinical standards. Tapering of
      medication might be considered at a later time-point. Patients who cannot be tapered off
      medication will be treated with the lowest possible dose.

      Treatment of subsequent exacerbations / psychotic relapses will follow the same rules.
