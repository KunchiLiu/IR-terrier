  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore CDZ173, a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, in patients with
      genetically activated PI3Kδ, i.e., patients with APDS/PASLI. The study consists of two
      parts. Part I is the open label part designed to establish the safety and pharmacokinetics
      of CDZ173 in the target population, as well as to select the optimal dose to be tested in
      part II. Part II is designed to assess efficacy and safety of CDZ173 in this population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who have a documented APDS/PASLI-associated genetic PI3K delta mutation

          -  study patients must have nodal and/or extranodal lymphoproliferation and
             corresponding clinical findings and manifestations compatible with APDS/PASLI such as
             a history of repeated oto-sino-pulmonary infections and/or organ dysfunction (e.g.,
             lung, liver).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medically significant disease or condition that is unrelated to APDS/PASLI

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
