      This is a multi-center open-label proof-of-concept study consisting of two parts: PART A - a
      phase I dose-finding study (3 + 3 classical design) evaluating the RP2D of afatinib in
      combination with selumetinib; and PART B - a randomized phase II study investigating the
      progression free survival and safety of selumetinib/afatinib combination therapy compared to
      standard of care chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      In a pre-clinical study, treatment of KRAS mutant (KRASm) colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines
      with an inhibitor of multiple epidermal growth factor receptor (ErBb) kinases in combination
      with a MEK-inhibitor resulted in synthetic lethality. MEK inhibition alone in these cells
      resulted in a strong feedback activation of human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER)2
      and HER3 after about 48 hours. This enables the formation of activating complexes with other
      ErbB family members such as EGFR, causing primary resistance via subsequent activation of
      the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Concomitant treatment with a MEK inhibitor and
      a multiple inhibitor of ErBbs completely suppressed this feedback activation and resulted in
      cell death. Among various combinations, the combination of afatinib, an irreversible
      EGFR/HER2/HER4 inhibitor, and selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, showed the strongest response in
      these cell lines by synergistic induction of apoptosis. This effect was observed both after
      concomitant use and after intermittent exposure to afatinib starting 48 hours after start of
      exposure to selumetinib. In addition to these observations in KRASm CRC cell lines, the
      anti-tumor activity of this combination was confirmed in cell lines derived from KRASm
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in xenografts in mice with KRASm NSCLC cells.

      Because of the histology-independent activity of this concept and the similarities in cancer
      cells at a molecular level, the combination of afatinib and selumetinib is likely to be
      effective in pancreatic cancer as well. Enhanced antitumor activity of the combination of a
      MEK and an EGFR inhibitor has already been established in pancreatic cancer cell lines in
      vitro. Therefore it is plausible that the combination of a MEK inhibitor with a multiple
      epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor will have enhanced efficacy in KRASm driven and
      PIK3CA wildtype pancreatic cancer in patients as well. Hence, there is a strong rationale
      for combining afatinib and selumetinib in patients with KRASm and PIK3CA wildtype (wt) CRC,
      NSCLC, or pancreatic cancer.
