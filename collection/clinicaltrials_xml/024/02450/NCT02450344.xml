      Objectives The aims of this study are to test the effectiveness of an online quiz
      competition in changing adolescents' alcohol-related attitudes and behaviour and to explore
      the feÂ¬asibility of using Internet viral marketing to reach a significant number of
      adolescents.

      Hypotheses to be tested

        1. The present online quiz competition is more effective in changing adolescents'
           alcohol-related attitudes and behaviours than traditional health promotion.

        2. Internet viral marketing is effective in reaching a significant number of adolescents.

      Design and subjects The study will constitute a cluster randomised controlled trial for 20
      secondary schools (6,720 Grade 7 to 9 students). Schools will be randomised to intervention
      or control arm with equal likelihood. Students in intervention schools will be invited to
      take part in the Internet campaign whereas those in control schools will receive relevant
      promotional leaflets.

      Study instrument An alcohol attitude and behaviour survey will be compiled with reference to
      standardised, validated instruments.

      Intervention Participants will log into the website and answer alcohol-related
      multiple-choice questions. They will be encouraged to promulgate the campaign to others.

      Main outcome measures Alcohol-related attitude and behaviour will be the primary outcome
      measures.

      Data analysis Multilevel regressions will mainly be used to evaluate the difference in
      attitude and behaviour.

      Expected results The results of the proposed study will provide evidence on the efficacy of
      an Internet intervention in modifying adolescents' attitudes and behaviour and guide further
      investigation into the prevention of and intervention in such risk behaviours as underage
      drinking.
