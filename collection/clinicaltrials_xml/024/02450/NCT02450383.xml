    <textblock>
      The purpose of this non-inferiority trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of acellular
      dermal matrix (ADM) in the augmentation of the gum around dental implants as compared to an
      autologous gum graft (sCTG) obtained from the palate (roof of the mouth) in human adults.

      AlloDerm is regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as human tissue for
      transplantation. AlloDerm is processed and marketed in accordance with the FDA's
      requirements for banked human tissue (21 CFR, Part 1270 and Part 1271) and Standards for
      Tissue Banking of the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB).

      20 adult subjects will be recruited who are in need of dental implant placement with
      simultaneous gum grafting to increase the thickness of the facial mucosa. Half of the
      subjects will be randomized to the ADM group and half will be randomized to the sCTG group.
      The surgical intervention will be performed according to the protocol and subjects will
      return for follow-up 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks post-surgery for follow-up measurements of
      healing, gum thickness, subject perception of pain, and esthetic photographs.
