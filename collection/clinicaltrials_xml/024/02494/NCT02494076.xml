  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits for children. A novel way of
      treating asthma is the use of positive expiratory pressure (PEP). Positive expiratory
      pressure works by creating pressure in the lungs to keep airways open and to clear mucus
      from the lungs. PEP is already used in the treatment of asthma at the investigators
      institution, but studies evaluating the efficacy of PEP therapy in asthma exacerbations do
      not exist. This study plans to learn more about the use of PEP therapy in the treatment of
      asthma exacerbations in children in the emergency department. Specifically, the study aims
      to evaluate if PEP therapy reduces the severity of asthma exacerbations in children and if
      it reduces the need for additional therapies and admission to the hospital. This study will
      be a randomized control trial comparing children who receive standard therapy to those who
      receive standard therapy plus PEP therapy in the treatment of asthma exacerbations. Children
      age 2 to 18 years presenting to the ED with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations will be
      included in the study. Reduction in clinical asthma severity will be measured by change in
      the Pulmonary Asthma Score (the respiratory severity score used at the investigators
      institution). The need for additional therapies and hospitalization will also be evaluated.

             with bronchodilators in their lifetime

          -  Initial ED presentation with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation, as defined by
             a pulmonary asthma score (PAS) &gt;7

          -  PAS score &gt;7 and &lt;12 after completion of first line therapies (three doses
