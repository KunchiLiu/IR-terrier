  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at the effect that different amounts of progressive
      exercise training has on risk factors associated with developing breast cancer. These risk
      factors include exercise capacity, body weight, and body composition, as well as the
      expression of certain genes and levels of inflammatory factors in your breast tissue.

    <description>During the study intervention phase, participants in Arm D will be asked to maintain their pre-study exercise level. Following the completion of the follow-up study assessments, participants who have completed all required study assessments Study Follow-Up), will be offered a 6-week supervised aerobic training program. Participants must be able to commence the aerobic training program with in 30 days of completing study follow-up assessments. The ultimate goal of the aerobic training program is 150 mins/wk of structured aerobic training per week at 55% to 100% of the individually determined exercise capacity (VO2peak) determined from the CPET test performed at Study Follow-Up. The 150 min/wk will be achieved by completing 3 aerobic training sessions/wk for approximately 50 mins/session. All sessions are required to be supervised. Intensity &amp; duration of aerobic training is prescribed &amp; implemented in accordance with standard exercise training principles.</description>
