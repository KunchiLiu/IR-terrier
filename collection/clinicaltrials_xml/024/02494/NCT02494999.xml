    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
      produced by Beijing Minhai Biotechnology Co., Ltd., a randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-controlled phase III clinical trial is planned to conduct in healthy infants aged
      3-6 months in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two arms. 900 healthy infants aged 3-6 months will be randomly assigned (1:1)
      to receive an experimental vaccine or a comparator vaccine in Month 0,1 and 2 (primary
      vaccination). All of them will receive a fourth dose as booster vaccination in Month 9.
