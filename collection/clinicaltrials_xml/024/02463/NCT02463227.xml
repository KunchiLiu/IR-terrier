    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      and antiviral activity of an antibody (called VRC01) in HIV-infected adults whose HIV is
      well-controlled with HIV medicines. The study will examine whether VRC01 controls or delays
      the return of HIV viremia when the participants' HIV medicines are briefly stopped during
      the study.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      and antiviral activity of a human monoclonal antibody, VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (known as VRC01),
      in HIV-infected adults whose HIV is well-controlled with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The
      study will examine whether VRC01 delays or prevents the return of HIV viremia in
      participants who are undergoing a brief analytical treatment interruption (ATI).

      The study will enroll HIV-infected participants 18 years and older who are on ART. (ART will
      not be provided by the study). At a pre-entry study visit, participants will undergo blood
      collection, a leukapheresis procedure, and a rectal biopsy. The study will last about 34
      weeks and proceed in three stages: Step 1 (approximately 9 weeks), Step 2 (approximately 12
      weeks), and Step 3 (approximately 13 weeks).

      During Step 1, participants will receive three doses of VRC01 via intravenous (IV) infusion.
      The first dose of VRC01 will be given on day 0. Seven days after receiving this first dose
      of VRC01, participants will discontinue ART. Participants will receive the second and third
      doses of VRC01 at days 21 and 42, respectively. For 7 days after each VRC01 IV infusion,
      participants will monitor and record their temperature and any symptoms. In addition to the
      3 injection study visits, participants will attend weekly visits from day 7 through
      approximately day 63 (week 9).

      Participants will enter Step 2 of the study and resume ART when they have a confirmed return
      of HIV-1 viremia or a confirmed CD4+ T-cell count of less than 350 cells/μL.

      Step 2 study visits will occur on the day ART is resumed (Step 2, week 1) and every four
      weeks thereafter (approximately at Step 2, weeks 4, 8, and 12) until a participant's HIV
      viral load decreases to less than 50 copies/mL.

      Throughout the study, visits will include clinical assessments and blood collection. Some
      blood will be stored for future testing. Some study visits will include the collection of
      oral, rectal, and (for women) cervical secretion samples. On day 63, participants will
      undergo another leukapheresis procedure and a rectal biopsy.

      Participants who have completed Step 2 may optionally enter Step 3 for additional testing.
      Entry into Step 3 will occur at least 3 months after the participant has completed Step 2.
      Step 3 participants will have additional study visits for a leukapheresis procedure, a
      rectal biopsy, and clinical follow up.

             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load
