      The purpose of this study is to investigate the gene expression and activity of SIRT1, and
      forkhead box O3 pathway by means of investigating target genes MnSOD and catalase in
      multiple sclerosis and healthy subjects. Also, we investigate the effect of melatonin on
      interaction between SIRT1 activity and target genes MnSOD and catalase in multiple sclerosis
      and healthy subject .Additionally, we evaluate effect the probable effect of melatonin
      treatment on gene expression and activity of above-mentioned genes in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells of healthy subjects-treated with H2O2.

        immunosuppressive drugs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) treated with antioxidant supplements,
             anti-inflammatory drugs, and vitamins in the previous 6 months; 2) had a history of
             acute or chronic infection, malignancy, diabetes (type I and II), and any clinically
             significant systemic disease; 3) was currently pregnant or lactating; 4) was
