  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the long term follow-up of a safety and tolerability trial to evaluate the effect of
      subretinal injection of human embryonic stem cell derived retinal pigment epithelium cells
      in patients with Age-Related Macular Degeneration(AMD).

    <textblock>
      This study is a long term, non interventional follow up to the phase I/II, open-label, non
      randomized, sequential, multi-center trial (referred to as the core protocol) in which 13
      AMD patients were treated. Ten poor vision patients (20/400) were transplanted with
      sequential doses of hESC-RPE cells, starting at a dose of 50,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted
      (three subjects), 100,000 hESC-RPE cells transplanted (three subjects), 150,000 hESC-RPE
      cells transplanted (three subjects) and increasing to a maximum dose of 200,000 hESC-RPE
      cells transplanted(one subject). Three better vision patients (20/100) were transplanted
      with a dose of 100,000 hESC-RPE cells.

      Eligible patients will be those who sign a consent form for the extension study, and who
      fulfill all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      The first visit of this extension protocol will correspond to the last visit of the core
      protocol, and will take place at 12 months post cell implantation.

      During the first 2 years after completion of the core protocol, i.e. from Year 1 to Year 2
      and from Year 2 to Year 3 post transplantation, the patients will be evaluated at
      approximately 3 month intervals; during years three thru five patients will be evaluated at
      approximately six month intervals. During years 6-15, patients will either be required to
      return to the study center or provide the name of an ophthalmologist in their locality who
      would provide an evaluation of the patient's vision and any abnormal findings and report
      these results to the study site annually.

      Follow up will include obtaining information about visual acuity, ophthalmological findings
      and adverse events (AEs), specifically including cancer, neurological, autoimmune or
      hematological disorders that developed or worsened since the last visit.
