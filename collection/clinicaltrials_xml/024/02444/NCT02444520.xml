  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) can be defined as physical symptoms that at present
      have no clear physical pathological cause. In primary care between 20 and 40% of patients
      have medically unexplained physical symptoms and in secondary care this figure rises to 50%
      in many specialties.

      This study design is a cross over randomized controlled trial with a waiting list to
      evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of studying a whole systems approach to care in
      general practice for adults with PPS. 'Integrated GP care' will be compared with treatment
      as usual (TAU) within a waiting list design.

      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a future randomized trial
      and to identify suitable primary outcome measures (outcomes that may be affected by
      'integrated GP care'), for a future trial evaluation and to inform the sample size/power
      calculation for such a trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with persistent physical symptoms (PPS) are often severely functionally impaired
      and very distressed. They consume large amounts of health care and welfare benefits.
      However, patients are often resistant to reassurance, traditional medical explanations and
      standard treatments aimed at symptom relief. In new referrals, it is generally appropriate
      to carry out a standard battery of investigations. However, in patients with PPS the search
      for demonstrable pathology often continues. Physicians in both primary and secondary care
      often feel they have little to offer. Advocacy groups evolve to mobilize public opinion,
      influence scientific debate and shape policy. Patients with PPS are often at the center of
      disputes over health insurance, health, welfare, disability and unemployment benefits.
      Return to work programs are often aimed at this group of patients who are at most risk of
      failing to return to work after a period of absence.

      The management of PPS is one of the most important tasks facing both general practice and
      the specialist in hospital medicine. There is an accumulating body of evidence demonstrating
      that cognitive behavioral interventions can reduce levels of symptoms and improve
      functioning in patients who have had PPS for several years. In 2011, a meta-analysis
      examined the efficacy of short term psychotherapy for PPS and this drew on ten previously
      published systematic reviews on psychological interventions as well as new trials. Overall,
      the studies were small and focused on patients with longstanding problems (mean = 13.3
      years). It was difficult for the authors to generalize, as the studies were so diverse in
      terms of number of sessions, setting, mode of delivery, who delivered therapy etc. In
      general, there was evidence for a small beneficial between group effect of Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for PPS but moderate effects for within group contrasts. The effect
      sizes differed considerably depending on the setting and outcome, such as, healthcare
      utilization, functional impairment, psychopathology and physical symptoms. Larger effect
      sizes tend to be seen for more specific syndromes, such as non-cardiac chest pain and
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The authors concluded by suggesting that mental health
      professionals were better placed to deliver therapy but that consultation rates could be
      tackled by general practitioners (GPs) trained specifically in communication skills.
      Furthermore, the authors also argued that because many patients are not willing to receive
      psychotherapy that medical health specialists should be trained to provide some treatment.

      There is evidence to suggest that interventions are efficacious for fatigue and fibromyalgia
      in primary care.

      The strength of evidence is much stronger for CBT in chronic PPS. The evidence for shaping
      the management of new referrals is less robust. However, any service development and
      evaluation should take this evidence into account. Commissioning Support for London piloted
      an integrated service model for medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) but that focused on
      commissioning and cost saving. The proposed study will build on this pilot by:

        -  Measuring patient satisfaction and patient reported outcomes;

        -  Include a broad range of patient groups in primary care, including those with
           non-cardiac chest pain, functional movement disorder, dizziness and fibromyalgia;

        -  Assess feasibility of trialing a new systems approach to management of patients in
           primary care using robust methods, namely a cluster randomized waiting list controlled
           trial.

    <description>The overall aims of the intervention are to help the patient:
develop an understanding of the relationship between cognitive, emotional, physiological and behavioral aspects of their problem;
understand factors that may be maintaining the problem;
learn how to modify the behavioral and cognitive responses which may be maintaining the problem;
adopt a healthy sleep routine which can promote healthy living.
The approach will be manual based, which is important for subsequent roll-out. Hand-outs will be available for GPs to give to patients, but the structure of the intervention allows for treatment to be formulation-based so that particular issues raised in the consultation that might be maintaining symptom severity (e.g. avoidance) can be addressed.</description>
