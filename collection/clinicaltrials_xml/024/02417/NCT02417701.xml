    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well target of rapamycin complex 1/2 (TORC1/2) inhibitor
      MLN0128 works in treating patients with lung cancer that is stage IV or has come back
      (recurrent) and has a mutation in the nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2) or
      kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) gene. Damage to these genes may cause the cancer
      to grow. TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 may stop this from happening by blocking enzymes.

      PRIMARY OBJECITVES:

      I. Evaluate the overall response rate of the TORC1/TORC2 inhibitor MLN0128 in NFE2L2 or
      KEAP1 mutant stage IV squamous cell lung cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the median progression free survival of patients in each cohort. II. To
      explore the feasibility of performing reverse phase protein array analysis (RPPA) in paired
      snap-frozen core biopsies from patients in this study prior to MLN0128 (TAK-228) dosing and
      during week 2 of treatment.

      III. To describe the effectiveness of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in suppressing activation of mTOR
      and PI3K signaling through the exploratory RPPA analysis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
