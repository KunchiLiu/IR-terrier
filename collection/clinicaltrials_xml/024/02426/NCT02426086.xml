  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percentage of spleen (largest lymph organ in
      the body) response and symptom response of 2 dose regimens of imetelstat in participants
      with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF) who are relapsed after or refractory to
      Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor treatment.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), multicenter
      (more than one hospital, medical school team or medical clinic work on a medical research
      study) study of 2 dosing regimens (treatment arms) of single-agent imetelstat in
      participants with intermediate-2 or high risk myelofibrosis (MF) whose disease is relapsed
      after or refractory to Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor treatment. Enrollment in the study may
      be approximately 160 participants if enrollment in Arm 1 is resumed after the second interim
      review. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening Phase (21 days before randomization);
      single-blind Treatment Phase (from randomization until study drug discontinuation); and
      Follow up Phase (until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent or study end,
      whichever occurs first). Participants in Arm 1 will receive imetelstat 9.4 milligram
      (mg)/kilogram (kg) intravenously (IV) for every 3 weeks until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or study end and Arm 2 will receive imetelstat 4.7 mg/kg IV for every
      3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end. Participants in Arm
      2 may continue with their current imetelstat dose or have it increased to 9.4 mg/kg at the
      investigator's discretion. Percentage of spleen response and symptom response will be
      evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
