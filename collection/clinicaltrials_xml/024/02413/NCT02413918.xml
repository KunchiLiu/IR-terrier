      1. To assess the acute and long-term bimodal efficacy of iloperidone (IL), as an adjunct
           to ongoing treatment with lithium (Li) or divalproex (DIV) or lamotrigine (LAM) or any
           combination of the three thereof, in a group of patients with an index episode of a
           mixed state in BD.

        2. To assess background, baseline features, and behavioral components which characterize
           treatment response/non-response in the acute and long term management of MS

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective 20-week, open-label study of iloperidone added to ongoing treatment
      regimen with mood stabilizers (Li or DIV or LAM or any combination of these) in the acute
      and maintenance treatment of MS- Total number of subjects: 40.

      Severity of the illness and psychopathological features will be measured by the following
      rating scales: YMRS, MADRS, CGI-S and GAS, and the BISS .

      The study will monitor the safety and tolerability of the combination iloperidone plus mood
      stabilizers.

      Efficacy Measures: Primary efficacy measures include 1) Mixed effects repeat measure of
      change from baseline in BISS total score and, secondarily, manic and depression subscale
      scores.

      Secondary Efficacy Measures: 1) response defined as 50% reduction in YMRS and MADRS and 2)
      Time to intervention or discontinuation for any mood episode.

      Iloperidone will be initiated at 2 mg at hs on day 1 with increase to 4mg at hs on day 2, 8
      mg at hs on day 3. All patients will have iloperidone titrated to receive a dosage of at
      least 12 mg a day. Dosages can be titrated up to 24 mg a day based on tolerability and
      clinical indication. Dosage of iloperidone can be reduced to 6 mg a day if patients develop
      side effects necessitating a reduction in the dosage
