      The investigators propose an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      between-subjects trial in which repeated ketamine treatment (0.5 mg/kg; once a week for 4
      weeks; a total of 4 ketamine infusions) will be evaluated for safety and efficacy. First,
      prior to the double-blind trial, the investigators will conduct an open-label trial that
      will include 5 patients with comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use
      disorder (AUD) to test safety and efficacy of repeated ketamine treatment (0.5 mg/kg; once a
      week for 4 weeks; a total of 4 ketamine infusions) with a follow-up of 4 weeks. Second,
      after reviewing the safety and efficacy of repeated ketamine treatment from the open-label
      trial, the investigators will conduct an 8-week, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial that will include 60 patients with comorbid MDD and AUD to test
      safety and efficacy of repeated ketamine treatment (0.5 mg/kg; once a week for 4 weeks; a
      total of 4 ketamine infusions) with a follow-up of 4 weeks. The 4-month follow-up session
      will also occur.
