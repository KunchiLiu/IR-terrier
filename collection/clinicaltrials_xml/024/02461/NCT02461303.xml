      Klinefelter syndrome is characterized by primary testicular failure and progressive
      infertility. The objective of this study is to determine if sperm are present and can be
      observed in urine and semen samples of adolescent and young adult Klinefelter patients and
      to determine whether the presence of sperm correlates with physical and/or clinically
      obtained hormone measures of pubertal development.

      This study was designed in order to answer the following questions:

        1. Is it possible to observe sperm in urine samples of adolescent and young adult
           Klinefelter patients?

        2. Is it possible to retrieve sperm for cryopreservation from semen samples of adolescent
           and young adult Klinefelter patients?

        3. Does the presence of sperm correlate with the physical and/or endocrine measures that
           are assessed during routine clinical evaluations of pubertal development in the KS
           patient population?

        4. If sperm retrieval is possible, what is the optimal age at which sperm retrieval should
           be attempted?

      Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) is a genetic condition in boys and men that results from having
      two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome. The incidence of the 47, XXY karyotype that defines
      the disorder ranges from 1:500 to 1:1000 in newborn males. The sexual development and
      fertility phenotypes of Klinefelter's syndrome include azoospermia (absence of sperm in the
      ejaculate), small firm testes, gynaecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue), low
      testosterone levels, and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone
      (LH) levels that can have an important impact on the quality of life for these patients.
      Beginning with puberty, testicular biopsies from Klinefelter patients progressively show a
      degenerated testicular environment with Sertoli-cell-only tubules, sclerotic or hyalinized
      tubules, and interstitial Leydig cell hyperplasia. Nevertheless, scattered areas with focal
      spermatogenesis can be seen in Klinefelter men, and assisted reproductive techniques now
      offer hope for patients who wish to father their own biological children. In these cases, a
      surgical sperm recovery procedure called testicular sperm extraction (TESE) is performed to
      extract sperm for in vitro reproductive methods. Success rates for testicular sperm
      extraction in Klinefelter patients are consistently above 50% (50 - 72%) and are similar to
      the success rates reported for TESE in azoospermic patients without Klinefelter syndrome.
      Pregnancy rates and life births after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are similar in
      couples with or without KS, and babies fathered by KS patients have a normal karyotype.
      Previous studies in adult KS patients reported that sperm recovery rates were significantly
      lower after the age of 35. Therefore, it was suggested that surgical sperm recovery in
      younger (possibly pubertal) boys should be considered as an option to maximize the
      opportunity to preserve their fertility before becoming sterile. However, there is
      considerable debate about the benefit of early invasive fertility intervention for KS
      patients.

      The standard, non-invasive and safe way to obtain and analyze sperm production and quality
      in normal post-pubertal males is to obtain a semen sample by masturbation. It is currently
      unknown when spermatogenesis starts in boys with KS, and if sperm could be detected by semen
      analysis in early puberty. In this proposal, the investigators aim to determine if
      non-invasive methods during puberty could be useful to assess the reproductive potential of
      KS patients, and to possibly cryopreserve sperm from these patients for future use with
      well-established assisted reproductive techniques like in vitro fertilization with ICSI
      (intra cytoplasmic sperm injection).

      Although this will be a sensitive topic for adolescent patients with KS and their parents,
      it is essential to begin the conversation regarding fertility preservation. Indeed, most
      parents and patients have questions regarding future fertility. This study has a secondary
      benefit in that it provides an ideal opportunity to educate the affected males and their
      families about the long-term effects of KS on their fertility and the availability of
      reproductive technologies to help with fertility. Similar discussions are becoming
      increasingly common (standard of care) for cancer patients who are at risk for infertility
      due to their disease or oncologic treatment.

      It is currently unknown when spermatogenesis starts in boys with KS. While it seems to be
      commonly accepted that there is a progressive depletion of germ cells in the testes of KS
      patients after the onset of puberty, the data to support this notion are equivocal due to
      small patient populations, lack of controls and absence of longitudinal data.

      In addition, the standard therapy for boys with KS is testosterone replacement therapy to
      trigger entry and progression of puberty characterized by the development of secondary
      sexual characteristics, bone maturation, and continued linear growth. However, testosterone
      supplementation also suppresses spermatogenesis (if present) through negative feedback on
      the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. Some argue that any intervention to preserve
      fertility for KS patients should ideally precede hormone replacement therapy. However, in
      one study it was proposed that topical testosterone therapy might not negatively affect
      spermatogenesis in adolescent KS patients. The risks and unknowns of invasive surgical
      procedures like TESE for boys have to be carefully weighed against the possible benefits for
      this unique patient population. For these reasons, the investigators propose that
      non-invasive methods would be appropriate to retrieve sperm and are essential to gain
      insights about the initiation and decline of spermatogenesis in KS patients.

      In this study, the investigators will analyse if sperm can be found in the urine and/or
      semen of Klinefelter patients during puberty and early adulthood. Participants will be
      followed until they reach age 26. During the time of their study participation, participants
      will provide a urine sample and/or a semen sample up to two times a year. This will be
      scheduled at the same time as routine visits with the patient's endocrinologist.

    <description>Subjects will be counseled on the impact of KS on the reduced fertility potential, and the option of providing a semen sample for semen analysis will be discussed. Semen analysis is the gold standard for fertility preservation in adult patients, but is only rarely considered by post-pubertal adolescent and young adult patients and their families. Only the semen analysis parameters will be used by the study for the comparison with physical and endocrine measures to assess whether spermatogenesis in these patients coincides with pubertal development. All potential frozen samples will be stored for the patient's future use, and samples will not be used for research experiments.</description>
