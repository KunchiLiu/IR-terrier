      Hepatocellular carcinoma is multifactorial in etiology and complex in pathogenesis, the
      blend of risk factors differs in different parts of the world, and this may explain in part
      the diverse biologic characteristics of HCC in different populations .

      Exposure to aflatoxin is an additional risk factor for the development of HCC, through
      damage of DNA in liver cells and mutation in p53 tumor suppressor gene . A previous study
      showed that aflatoxin B1 has a considerable role in the development of HCC among Egyptians .

      Clinical studies have shown that AFB1 selectively targets at the third base position of
      codon 249 of the human p53 gene, a known mutational hotspot in human hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) . A significant association between aflatoxin exposure and HCC has been
      reported in hyperendemic areas . A synergistic interaction between AFB1 exposure and viral
      hepatitis B (HBV) infection on HCC risk has been reported in several epidemiologic studies.

      Aflatoxin exposure may be associated with advanced liver disease in chronic hepatitis C
      (HCV) patients. Levels of AFB1-albumin/albumin were significantly related to
      ultrasono-graphic hepatic parenchyma scores in anti-HCV-positive subjects .

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy in the world and the
      third most common cause of cancer-related deaths complicating liver cirrhosis in most cases.

      In Egypt, there has been a remarkable increase of the proportion of HCC among chronic liver
      diseases (CLD) patients from 4.0% to 7.2% over a decade. This rising proportion may be
      explained by the increasing risk factors such as the emergence of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      over the same period of time, the contribution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection,
      improvement of the screening programs and diagnostic tools of HCC as well as the increased
      survival rate among patients with cirrhosis to allow time for some of them to develop HCC .

        After the approval of research ethics committee at Tanta Faculty of Medicine, this study
        was conducted in tropical medicine department, Tanta university hospital on 75
        individuals; 40 patients diagnosed as HCC were included as group I. Their household
        relatives sharing same economic and environmental conditions were invited to share in the
        study. All of them gave an informed consent to share in the study; 20 cirrhotic patients
        who were included as group II, and 15 healthy non hepatic individuals were included as
        control (group III).
