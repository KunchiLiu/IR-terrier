        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of episodic migraine (as defined by International
             Classification of Headache Disorders [ICHD]-228) who experience an average of 2 to 6
             migraine attacks a month for the past 12 months with no more than 14 headache days
             per month, and with at least 48 hours of headache-free time between migraine attacks;

          2. Patients with onset of migraine with or without aura before age 50;

          3. Patients who have migraine with or without aura, in which the aura cannot last longer
             than 60 minutes;

          4. Patients who report usual migraine pain of 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) on headache
             pain severity scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with medication overuse headache (MOH) as defined by ICHD-228:

               -  Opioids ≥ 10 days a month during the 90 days prior to screening

               -  Combination medications (eg, Fiorinal® ≥ 10 days a month)

               -  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other simple medications &gt; 14
                  days a month during the 90 days prior to screening

               -  Triptans or ergots ≥ 10 days a month during the 90 days prior to screening

          2. Patients on chronic warfarin sodium;

          3. Patients taking monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitors;

          4. Patients on unstable dosages of chronic medications during the 3 months prior to and
             through screening, or who are not willing or able to maintain a stable pre-study dose
             throughout study participation;

          5. Patients with more than 6 migraine attacks a month and/or more than 14 headache days
             a month (based upon patient self-report);

          6. Patients with hemiplegic migraine or migraine with brain stem aura or other forms of
             neurologically complicated migraine;

          7. Patients with atypical aura;

          8. Patients with prolonged aura (more than 1 hour).

          9. Patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack;

         10. Patients with a history of migralepsy or a concurrent diagnosis of seizure disorder;

         11. Patients who cannot differentiate between a migraine headache and a tension-type or
             cluster headache or any other non-migraine headache;

         12. Patients with a history of more than 10 tension-type headaches per month;

         13. Patients with a history of cluster headache;

         14. Patients with a diagnosis of ICHD-2 &quot;probable migraine&quot;;

         15. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (screening blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg
             despite appropriate pharmacotherapy);

         16. Patients with severe renal impairment (defined as serum creatinine &gt; 1.9 mg/dL);

         17. Patients with serum total bilirubin &gt; 1.9 mg/dL;

         18. Patients with serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
             or alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal;

         19. Patients with positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B
             surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody.

         20. Patients with a history of alcohol or substance abuse (including marijuana and
             medical marijuana) within 1 year that would compromise data collection;

         21. Patients with a history of or current neurological or psychiatric impairment, or
             cognitive dysfunction that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise data
             collection;

         22. Patients with any other medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator
             or medical monitor, would confound the objectives of the study (eg, cancer history
             [except basal cell carcinoma], systemic lupus erythematosus);

         23. Patients who have participated in a clinical trial involving any medication during
             the past 30 days or 5 half-lives of the study medication, whichever is longer
