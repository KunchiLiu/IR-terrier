  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the effects that a six month lifestyle-based
      mobile health (mHealth) peripheral artery disease (PAD) prevention program will have on
      improving physical activity, fitness, important PAD risk factors and quality of life (QOL)
      in patients with PAD.

      By testing a novel mHealth intervention focused on lifestyle modification, this trial will
      address a critical evidence gap in the care of PAD patients. PAD patients are not eligible
      for cardiac rehabilitation and therefore struggle with unhealthy lifestyles, and these
      patients currently have no lifestyle-based care strategies to help them. The results of this
      study have the potential to lead to new sustainable and resource-efficient, lifestyle-based
      preventive care strategies for patients with stable PAD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized trial designed to examine the hypothesis that a
      lifestyle-based mHealth peripheral artery disease (PAD) prevention program will improve
      physical activity, fitness, important PAD risk factors and quality of life (QOL).

      The investigators may enroll up to 55 men and women being evaluated for leg pain from Duke
      PAD cardiovascular clinics or after lower extremity angioplasty in the Duke catheterization
      laboratory. Of the 55 men and women volunteers who may be initially consented, the
      investigators anticipate a portion (potentially 20%) may drop out during the study timeline,
      and approximately 45 are expected to complete this study. Following informed consent and
      baseline testing, the participants will be randomized (1.25:1.00) into either a mHealth
      (N=25) or usual care group (N=20) [for comparison] for a 24-week period. All patients will
      be evaluated for walking ability on a treadmill test, quality of life questionnaires, health
      literacy related to PAD and the most important risk factors specific to PAD (blood glucose
      if diabetic, daily physical activity and blood pressure).

    <description>Participants will wear a Fitbit Physical Activity Monitor to objectively quantify physical activity patterns. Once a week (Â± 3 days) during the 24 week mHealth intervention patients will measure and download their blood pressure and blood glucose (if diabetic) by means of a Withings blood pressure cuff and iHealth glucometer. Medication adherence will be measured at baseline, 12-weeks and 24-weeks by the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8) questionnaire. Study staff will contact participants weekly to report whether or not they have taken their medications. Each participant will be provided with a electronic version of the book titled, &quot;Your COMPLETE and EASY GUIDE to Understanding Peripheral Artery Disease&quot;; patients will be asked to read approximately one chapter per week for educational purposes.</description>
