      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patient satisfaction and quality of life in
      patients with ileostomy managed with or without the novel Ostom-i Alert device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ileostomy have impaired quality of life related to their ileostomy (Person et
      al. DCR. 2012; 55: 783 - 787; Scarpa et al. Colorectal Dis. 2010; 12: 914 - 920). Although
      patients with ileostomy have better overall quality of life compared with colostomy patients
      (Silva et al. Worl J Surg. 2003; 27: 421-424), the liquid nature of the ileostomy effluent
      predisposes these patients to bag overfilling and dehydration more so than colostomy
      patients (Paquette et al. DCR 2013; 56: 974-979). This may be specifically important in
      populations with long term or permanent ileostomy. Overfilling and breakage/leakage of the
      ileostomy bag can also affect patient's ability to function in social environments, go out
      in public, have intimate relationships with significant others, and interfere with sleep
      patterns (due to high output and nighttime overfilling of the ileostomy bag).

      The Ostom-i Alert is a novel device developed by a patient with ileostomy and now FDA
      approved in the United States. The device is a sensor that clips onto any ostomy bag and
      sends a Bluetooth signal to a mobile device app. An alarm lets the patient know before the
      stoma bag is at risk for overfilling and leaking. The potential advantage is that the device
      can prevent unexpected bag overfilling, breakage, and nighttime accidents. This may
      therefore lead to improved quality of life. The volume and output recordings can also be
      stored and emailed to the patient's health care providers, with potential to reduce ostomy
      related dehydration through more accurate volume recording and sharing.

      While the device has many applications, the purpose of this research study is to
      specifically evaluate patient quality of life after application of the Ostom-i Alert
      compared with standard ostomy care.
