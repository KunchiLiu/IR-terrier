  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm, multi-center, patient-randomized, field evaluation of the &quot;Way to Cure&quot;
      behavioral interventions on medication adherence in HCV.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 3-arm trial will field test the efficacy of &quot;Way to Cure&quot; intervention on medication
      adherence in Hepatitis C for 12 weeks. As part of routine clinical care all patients will
      receive medication counseling regarding proper use and side effects by trained nurses or
      pharmacists depending on the clinical site.

      Arm 1: Control (n=20) - Monitoring caps will be set into &quot;quiet mode&quot;. This mode sends daily
      adherence data to the Way to Health platform each time the participant opens the pill
      bottle, however, does not remind the participant to take the medication. In the event no
      electronic signal is received by the platform for 96 hours, the RA will call the participant
      to assess any usability or connectivity issues.

      Arm 2: Intervention - Reminders/Feedback (n=20) - Patients will receive tailored text
      message reminders to take the medication if in case the interval from last cap opening is
      &gt;30 hours (greater than 6 hours overdue). Patients will receive weekly text messages with
      summary cumulative adherence scores.

      Arm 3: Intervention - Reminders/Feedback and Financial Incentives (n=20) - In addition to
      reminders with missed doses and weekly adherence feedback, patients in this arm will be
      eligible to receive a financial incentive each week they demonstrate perfect &gt;85% adherence.
      The weekly adherence feedback message will also alert patients whether they earned the
      incentive for the past week.
