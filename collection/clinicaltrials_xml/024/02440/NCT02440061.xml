  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ghrelin is a hormone naturally produced in the stomach and the gut. The purpose of this
      research study is to determine the role of this gut hormone in the regulation of insulin
      secretion from the pancreas and glucose disposal after we eat. The investigators hypothesize
      that ghrelin has an effect on the pancreas and on how our body handles glucose after we eat.
      The investigators will compare insulin secretion and glucose changes during meal ingestion
      while either acyl ghrelin (AG) or saline (salt solution) is being infused through your vein
      on separate study days. AG is a form of the ghrelin hormone that has a small modification to
      it that allows it to bind to a specific receptor. The investigators hypothesize that AG has
      an effect on how the body handles glucose after a meal. AG has been approved by the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human research only. This study will also involve the
      use of a medicine called arginine, which is a naturally occurring product and found in many
      nutritional supplements. Its use in this study is investigational. The use of arginine helps
      maximize insulin release from the pancreas so the investigators can better examine whether
      AG affects insulin secretion.
