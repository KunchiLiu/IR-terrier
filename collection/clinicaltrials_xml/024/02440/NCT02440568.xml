      This is a dose escalation study to evaluate Omacetaxine when given in combination with a
      standard induction regimen of &quot;7+3&quot; (cytarabine for Days 1-7 and Idarubicin for Days 1-3) in
      patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

      This is a dose escalation study to evaluate Omacetaxine when given in combination with a
      standard induction regimen of &quot;7+3&quot; (cytarabine for Days 1-7 and Idarubicin for Days 1-3) in
      patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Omacetaxine will be given
      subcutaneously Q12 hours on Days 1-7. The optimally safe and active dose (OD) will be
      determined using the EffTox design. EffTox is a Bayesian adaptive design that seeks to
      determine the optimal dose for further study in Phase II by considering a trade-off between
      efficacy and toxicity. The EffTox design begins by treating a cohort of three patients at
      dose level 1. These patients' efficacy and toxicity outcomes are used to update the
      posterior distributions for the probability of efficacy and toxicity and identify acceptable
      dose levels. The study terminates if no dose levels are acceptable. Otherwise, the
      acceptable doses are ranked using the Euclidean distance from (1.0, 0.0) and the next cohort
      is treated at the dose with the minimum distance under the restriction that we may only
      escalate or deescalate by one dose level at a time (e.g., the second cohort can only
      escalate to dose level 2 or deescalate to dose level -1). The second cohort is treated at
      the dose with the minimum distance and posterior distributions, and the list of acceptable
      doses and distances are updated as before. This process continues until at least 20 subjects
      are enrolled in the study. The dose with the minimum distance at study completion is
      considered the optimal dose for further investigation. If none of the dose levels are
      acceptable at study completion, an optimal dose level will not be identified and the drug
      does not warrant further investigation.

      Post induction therapy will consist of standard cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy or
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation based on pretreatment risk assessment.

    <description>The primary endpoint is determination of the optimally active and safe dose (OD) of Omacetaxine when added to the standard-of-care induction chemotherapy for AML and the estimation of the efficacy and response rate. OD will be defined as a dose level at which fewer than 10% of patients experience hematologic toxicity and greater than 50% of patients achieve a CR (as a second induction is not being given in this study).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newly diagnosed, untreated patients with AML according to the WHO classification for
             AML.18

          2. Patients age 18 to 70 years old who meet diagnostic criteria for AML according to the
             WHO classification for AML.

          3. Previously untreated AML (≥20% blasts). Note that prior short-term therapy (≤7 days)
             with hydroxyurea, steroids, biological or targeted therapy (e.g. FLT3 inhibitors,
             other kinase inhibitors, azacitidine, ATRA), or hematopoietic growth factors is
             allowed. A single or two-day dose of cytarabine (up to 3 g/m2) for emergency use is
             also allowed as prior therapy.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0-3

          5. Adequate organ function, if not suspected to be due to AML, within 14 days of study
             registration, defined as:

             Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x ULN (unless due to hemolysis) AST and ALT &lt; 3 X ULN (unless
             believed to be due to tumor involvement) Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Creatinine
             Clearance &gt; 30 ml/min

          6. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test in females. Patients of reproductive potential
             (males and females) must consent to and practice double-barrier methods of
             contraception during treatment and for 12 weeks following the last dose of
             Omacetaxine.

          7. Patients must be willing and able to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with AML age 71 or older.

          2. Acute promyelocytic leukemia.

          3. Other investigational drug use within 4 weeks of study entry.

          4. Cardiac insufficiency grade III or IV New York Heart Association (NYHA)

          5. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding.

          6. Patients who are HIV positive.

          7. Active uncontrolled infection or severe systemic infection

          8. Concurrent malignancy (other than AML) with an estimated life expectancy less than
             two years and requiring active therapy.

          9. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude
             study compliance and follow-up.

         10. Uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or
             electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or medically relevant active
             conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at
             screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant.

         11. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for enrollment in this study.

         12. Pregnant or breastfeeding: Omacetaxine is a Pregnancy Category D medication and has
             caused embryo-fetal death in animals. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant
             must be established by a negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test
             result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for
             post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.
