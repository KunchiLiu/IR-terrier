    <textblock>
      This study is a dose escalation, and cohort expansion study in subjects with advanced cancer
      (excluding cancer with extensive bone marrow involvement such as leukemias and multiple
      myeloma) for which no standard therapy exists. Subjects must have received prior treatment
      for cancer that has not worked, or has stopped working.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts. Part A is a dose escalation study to determine a
      safe and tolerable dose of ASN002 for subjects with relapsed or refractory lymphoma, or
      advanced solid tumors. Part A will also characterize the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of ASN002 through blood sampling. Subjects in Part B will enroll only
      lymphoma subjects, and will consist of three cohorts (Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma,
      Follicular Lymphoma, and Mantle Cell Lymphoma). Subjects will be treated with the highest
      safe and tolerable dose determined in Part A of the study to determine preliminary efficacy
      in lymphoma. Subjects may continue to receive ASN002 for up to 1 year in the absence of
      severe side effects or disease progression.
