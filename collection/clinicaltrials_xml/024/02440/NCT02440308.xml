      This clinical trial studies the use of gallium-68 (68Ga)-DOTA-Bombesin positron emission
      tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in imaging patients with prostate cancer.
      PET uses a radioactive substance called 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin, which attaches to tumor cells
      with specific receptors on their surfaces. The PET scanner takes pictures that capture where
      the radioactive drug is &quot;lighting up&quot; and attaching to tumor cells, which may help doctors
      recognize differences between tumor and healthy prostate tissue. MRI uses radio waves and a
      magnet to make a picture of areas inside the body. Using 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin in diagnostic
      procedures, such as PET/MRI, may allow doctors to identify smaller tumors than standard
      imaging.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility and biodistribution of 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin (BAY 86-7548 or
      68Ga-DOTA RM2).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-DOTA-Bombesin intravenously (IV) and then undergo PET/MRI
      approximately 60 later.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24 hours and 1 week.
