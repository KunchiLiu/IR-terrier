      The study goal was to understand the effect of Metformin on Corus® CAD (henceforth &quot;Corus&quot;)
      in pre-diabetic patients who are medication naive. This study provided data to determine if
      the Corus gene expression signature was different in pre-diabetic patients when metformin
      was newly prescribed and taken.

      The study goal was to understand the effect of Metformin on Corus® CAD (henceforth &quot;Corus&quot;)
      in pre-diabetic patients who are medication naive. This study provided data to determine if
      the Corus gene expression signature was different in pre-diabetic patients when metformin
      was newly prescribed and taken. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether
      metformin used in pre-diabetic patients to prevent progression to type II diabetes had a
      significant effect on the gene expression levels measured in Corus. This was a prospective
      study. Subjects were enrolled from participating sites as applicable inclusion/exclusion
      criteria were met. The study aimed to enroll approximately fifty (50) patients.
