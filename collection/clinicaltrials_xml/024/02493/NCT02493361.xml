  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase II, open label, single-arm trial of intratumoral pIL-12 EP in
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with low TIL melanoma. Patients will initiate
      treatment of pembrolizumab concurrently with the first cycle of intratumoral pIL-12 EP.
      Pembrolizumab will be administered at 200 mg flat dose every 3 weeks. Cycles of intratumoral
      pIL-12 EP (each cycle consisting of treatment on days 1, 5 and 8) will occur every 6 weeks
      as long as patients have accessible lesions for EP. Patients will be evaluated for response
      every 12 weeks by RECIST v1.1. Patients will continue on therapy if they have stable disease
      or better, defined under investigator evaluation at the time of disease evaluations. Therapy
      will be given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The only exception will be
      those patients who experience a confirmed CR and who have been on treatment for at least 6
      months; these patients may discontinue treatment at the investigator's discretion. Patients
      may reinitiate either therapy post-complete remission relapse if the study remains open and
      the patient meets the conditions outlined in the protocol. Patients will be followed
      continually for safety and tolerability by assessment of adverse events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histological or cytological diagnosis of melanoma with progressive
             locally advanced or metastatic disease that is not amenable to definitive local
             therapy with curative intent.

          -  At least one tumor accessible for intratumoral injection and EP on investigator's
             assessment.

          -  Patients may have had prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy or radiation therapy. All
             prior therapies must be stopped 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment, with
             the exception of patients who have received ipilimumab, which must be stopped 6 weeks
             prior to first dose of study treatment. Patients are prohibited from receiving live
             vaccines within 30 days prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Patient has agreed to two newly obtained biopsies of tumor (that can be biopsied on
             investigator's assessment) and to providing the acquired tissue for biomarker
             analysis. Analysis by a central laboratory of one of the fresh biopsy samples must
             show &lt;70% PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4+ in the CD45+ gate based on flow cytometry. A second fresh
             biopsy sample is required, not for eligibility purposes, but for further biomarker
             analysis and confirmation at a later date of low PD-L1 expression using Merck's PD-L1
             IHC assay (clone 22C33). Archival tissue from a biopsy obtained for other purposes
             (i.e. not a protocol procedure) may be used for low PD-L1 expression confirmation
             given that: tissue must not be previously irradiated; no systemic antineoplastic
             therapy received by the patient between the time of the biopsy and the first
             administration of study treatment. Even if archival tissue is collected, two newly
             obtained biopsies are still required at baseline.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.

          -  Adequate renal function:

          -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN

          -  Coagulation:

          -  International normalized ration (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 x ULN (Only if
             not using anticoagulants*)

          -  Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5 x ULN (Only if not using
             anticoagulants*)

               -  If patient is receiving anticoagulants, then value must be within therapeutic
                  range for the condition that patient is being treated for.

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 14 days of administration of study therapy.

          -  The effects of pIL-12 EP and pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             For this reason women of child-bearing potential (not free from menses for &gt;2 years,
             post hysterectomy/oophorectomy, or surgically sterilized) and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception: 2 adequate barrier methods or a barrier method plus a
             hormonal method of contraception to prevent pregnancy or abstain from heterosexual
             activity throughout the study, starting with the first study treatment through 120
             days after the last dose of study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol
             must also agree to use adequate contraception starting with the first dose of study
             drug through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

          -  Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to
             sign it.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study of an
             investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of

             8 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Patient has risk factors for bowel obstruction or bowel perforation (examples include
             but not limited to a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and
             abdominal carcinomatosis).

          -  Patient previously had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another
             mAb.

          -  Patient has a history of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Patients with electronic pacemakers or defibrillators are excluded from this study,
             as the effect of electroporation on these devices is unknown.

          -  Patient has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune
             disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.
             Patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be exception to this
             rule. Patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid
             injections would not be excluded from the study. Patients with hypothyroidism that is
             stable on hormone replacement will not be excluded from the study.

          -  Patient has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or
             requires any other form of immunosuppressive medication. However, patients using
             physiologic replacement doses of hydrocortisone, or its equivalent, will be
             considered eligible for this study; up to 20 mg hydrocortisone (or 5 mg of
             prednisone) in the morning and 10 mg hydrocortisone (or 2.5 mg of prednisone) in the
             evening.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects upon treatment with pIL-12 EP + pembrolizumab is unknown.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with pIL-12 EP + pembrolizumab breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pIL-12 EP + pembrolizumab.

          -  Patients with symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A patient who is clinically
             stable following treatment for these conditions is eligible.
