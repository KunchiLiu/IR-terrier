  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to find out if tocilizumab, also known as Actemra™, can
      help with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The investigators also want to find out if
      tocilizumab is safe to take without causing too many side effects.

      Currently ALS has no cure and only 1 modestly effective treatment to slow the progression of
      the disease. Although not the initial cause of ALS, the immune system plays a role in the
      death of motor neurons. The immune cells that participate in this process are stimulated by
      a substance called interleukin-6 (IL-6) whose effect is blocked by tocilizumab and thus, may
      slow the death of motor neurons and slow the disease.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week study evaluating
      the safety and tolerability of tocilizumab in subjects with sporadic ALS.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      intravenous administration of 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab every 4 weeks vs. matched intravenous
      placebo administered every 4 weeks over an 8 week period.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to describe the expression of pro-inflammatory
      genes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of sporadic ALS patients, to assess the
      ability of tocilizumab to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in PBMCs and
      pro-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with sporadic ALS
      and to assess the CSF penetration of tocilizumab.

      Approximately 4 Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) Centers in the US will participate in the
      study. Twenty-four subjects will be randomized in the study.

      This study will be conducted in subjects who meet the El Escorial criteria of possible,
      laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS. At
      screening, eligible subjects must be at least 18 years old, must have a slow vital capacity
      (SVC) ≥ 60% of predicted capacity for age, height and gender, and must provide written
      informed consent prior to screening. Subjects on a stable dose of riluzole and those not
      taking riluzole, and women of child-bearing age at screening are eligible for inclusion as
      long as they meet specific protocol requirements. Detailed criteria are described in the
      body of the protocol.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or
      matching placebo every 4 weeks over an 8 week period.

      This research study protocol allows the subject to receive up to 3 infusions of Tocilizumab.
      Even if the treatment is shown to be of benefit, additional infusions of Tocilizumab beyond
      that allowed in the protocol cannot be given to the subject while she/he is participating in
      this study.

      Subjects will remain on randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment until the
      Week 8 visit. Each randomized subject will also have a Week 12 Follow-up visit and Week 16
      End-of-Study visit to assess for adverse events (AEs), changes in concomitant medications,
      to administer the ALSFRS-R and selected study procedures.
