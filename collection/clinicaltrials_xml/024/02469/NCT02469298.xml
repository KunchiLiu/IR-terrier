  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study 201682 is a Phase IIa, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled four arm
      outpatient study evaluating the safety, tolerability and clinical effect of danirixin or
      danirixin + oseltamivir combination in comparison to placebo or oseltamivir twice daily for
      5 days in otherwise healthy adults with laboratory confirmed influenza infection. Danirixin
      is a selective and reversible C-X-C Chemokine Receptor 2 (CXCR2) antagonist that inhibits
      neutrophil transmigration and activation to areas of inflammation. The study endpoints are
      intended to test the hypothesis that inhibition of neutrophil activation by approximately
      50-60% (as previously measured by cluster of differentiation [CD11b] expression in response
      to chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 1 [CXCL1] stimulation ex vivo in human studies) will not
      impact safety parameters or worsen clinical manifestations of disease, disease-related
      events of interest, or viral load, and may possibly improve these parameters when
      administered within 48 hours of symptom onset. The aim of this exploratory study is to
      obtain data on the safety, tolerability and clinical effect of GSK1325756 (danirixin [DNX])
      alone or in combination with oseltamivir (OSV) in otherwise healthy adults with acute,
      uncomplicated influenza prior to future evaluation in hospitalized patients with complicated
      influenza. The primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of DNX with and
      without a neuraminidase inhibitor through the evaluation of AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory
      tests, vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. Safety assessments will also
      include an assessment of disease related events (DREs) of interest and associated antibiotic
      use. The Influenza Intensity and Impact Questionnaire (FluiiQ™) will be used in the study to
      document patient reported outcomes (PROs). The screening visit in Australia will be composed
      of a pre-screen for influenza infection with an influenza rapid antigen test followed by a
      screen for the remaining eligibility criteria for those subjects with a positive result on
      the influenza rapid antigen test. FluiiQ is trademark owned by Measured Solutions for Health
      Private Limited.

        consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. For
        non-product methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent
        and correct use. The GSK definition is based on the definition provided by the
        International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH). The investigator is responsible for
        ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception;

          -  Female subject: is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a
             negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least
             one of the following conditions applies

        Non-reproductive potential defined as:

        Pre-menopausal females with one of the following: documented Tubal ligation; Documented
        Hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal
        occlusion; Hysterectomy; Documented Bilateral oophorectomy; Postmenopausal defined as 12
        months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
        follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause).
        Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will
        be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to
        continue their HRT during the study.

        Reproductive potential agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GSK
        Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of
        Reproductive Potential (FRP) requirements from the time of screening, during dosing, and
        until at least 36 hrs after the last dose of study medication and completion of the
        follow-up visit.

        GSK List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive
        Potential (FRP) meeting GSK criteria of highly effective: having a failure rate of less
        than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance
        with the product label. This list does not apply to FRP with same sex partners, when this
        is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be
        abstinent from penilevaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis.

        Contraceptive subdermal implant; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system; Combined
        estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive; Injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal
        ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches; Male partner sterilization with documentation of
        azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole
        partner for that subject.

        These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently,
        correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for
        ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.
