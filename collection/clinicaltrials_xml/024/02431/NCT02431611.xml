      Developing effective tobacco cessation interventions during pregnancy for American Indian
      and Alaska Native people is a national priority and will contribute to the U.S. public
      health objective of reducing tobacco-related cancer health disparities. The proposed project
      builds on the investigators' successful partnership with the Alaska Native community and
      previous work with Alaska Native pregnant women. The investigators propose to develop and
      test a novel biomarker feedback intervention relating cotinine levels in the urine of
      pregnant women with the woman and infant's likely exposure to the tobacco specific
      nitrosamine and carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK). This
      5-year project will be conducted in three phases. In Phase 1 the investigators will utilize
      a non-randomized, clinical observational trial to examine biomarkers of nicotine and
      carcinogen exposure (urine cotinine and total NNAL [a metabolite of NNK], respectively)
      among 150 maternal-infant pairs with assessments conducted during pregnancy and at delivery.
      In Phase 2, the investigators will obtain qualitative feedback on the findings from Phase 1
      through individual interviews conducted with 32 women who use tobacco to develop the
      biomarker feedback intervention messages. Phase 3 will consist of a formative evaluation of
      the biomarker feedback intervention with 60 pregnant women using a two-group randomized
      design to assess the intervention's feasibility and acceptability, and the biochemically
      confirmed abstinence rate at the end of pregnancy. All phases of the project will be guided
      by a Community Advisory Committee. Each phase is an important step to advance the
      investigators' understanding of the potential for biomarker feedback as a strategy to help
      Alaska Native pregnant women quit tobacco use. The potential reach of the intervention is
      significant from a public health perspective as over 600 tobacco users deliver each year at
      the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage where the proposed project will take place.
      Developing effective interventions for tobacco cessation during pregnancy is important to
      reduce adverse health consequences for the mother and neonate and future risk of
      tobacco-caused cancers.

      This is the third and final phase of the project.
