      This study will be a randomised, double-blind, multiple dose (14 days), placebo-controlled,

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multiple dosing (14 Â± 1 days), placebo-controlled,
      incomplete block crossover, multi-center study to assess efficacy and safety of 3 dose
      levels of AZD7594, given once daily by inhalation, in patients with mild to moderate asthma.

      This multi-center study will be conducted at multiple sites in Europe. It is planned that
      approximately 48 patients with mild to moderate asthma will be randomized into the study
