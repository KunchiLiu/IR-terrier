    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy of indacaterol versus placebo in COPD patients
      classified as GOLD 2014 Patient Group B.

      This is a 2-arm parallel group study that will recruit COPD patients classified by GOLD
      Patient Gorup B. On successful completion of run-in period, patients will be randomized in
      the ratio 1:1 to receive prn salbutamol plus:

        1. Indacaterol 150ug or

        2. Placebo for indacaterol all od for 26 weeks. The primary objective (trough FEV1) will
           be assessed after 12 weeks.
