      The Purpose of this trial is to define the characteristics of the patients with low back
      pain in oriental rehabilitation clinic. This information will create a registry that will
      help us to compare similarities and differences in patients and their symptoms. The more
      patients the investigators are able to enter into the registry, the more the investigators
      will be able to understand the low back pain and learn better ways of caring for patients.
