    <textblock>
      The Substance Abuse Treatment to HIV care (SAT2HIV) project, a Type 2
      Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Trial, seeks to address this gap in services by
      providing new knowledge regarding the effectiveness of brief intervention (BI) for substance
      use within community-based HIV/AIDS service settings, as well as new knowledge regarding how
      to address the well-documented underutilization of evidence-based practices in real-world
      settings. The specific aims of this project are: Aim 1: To experimentally test the
      effectiveness of a motivational interviewing-based BI for substance use within
      community-based HIV/AIDS service organizations, relative to usual care (UC). Aim 2: To
      experimentally test the effectiveness of adding an organizational-level implementation
      intervention called Implementation &amp; Sustainment Facilitation (ISF) to enhance the
      effectiveness of the implementation strategy currently used by SAMHSA-funded Addiction
      Technology Treatment Centers (ATTCs; i.e., online introductory training, 2-day training
      workshop, ongoing feedback and coaching).
