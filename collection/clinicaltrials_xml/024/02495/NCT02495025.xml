  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of telephone-based early
      childhood developmental screening and care coordination, compared to usual care in a primary
      care pediatrics clinic. We will randomize approximately 150 participants to each study arm,
      with the intervention families receiving developmental screening over the phone, and control
      families receiving usual care with their pediatricians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends universal early childhood
      developmental screening as part of routine well-child care, there have been many studies
      documenting that many pediatricians do not follow the AAP guidelines. One intervention that
      has the potential to improve care, especially for low-income families, is centralized,
      telephone-based developmental screening, and care coordination for families whose children
      have developmental or behavioral concerns. 211 Los Angeles developed such an intervention
      and this study aims to test its effectiveness, in partnership with a local community clinic,
      using a randomized, controlled study design. We have partnered with the Clinica Oscar A
      Romero, a federally-qualified health center in Los Angeles, serving predominantly low-income
      Latino families. We hope to enroll up to 300 families in the study. Eligible families will
      have children ages 18 to 36 months of age who receive well-child care at the clinic. As we
      obtain informed consent and enroll families, we will randomize study participants into
      intervention and control groups. Intervention group families will be transferred to 211 Los
      Angeles to complete developmental screening over the phone, while control group families
      will go to their pediatricians for well-child care as usual.

    <description>Families randomized to the intervention arm will be connected with 211 Los Angeles for completion of developmental screening over the phone. Screening will consist of three structured, validated, parent-report tools: the Parental Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS), the PEDS Developmental Milestones (PEDS:DM), and the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT). If any developmental or behavioral concerns are present, the care coordinator at 211 Los Angeles will make appropriate referrals for developmental evaluation and intervention services. A copy of the care plan generated from 211 will be sent to the child's primary care provider and included in the medical record.</description>

    <description>Children randomized to the control group will report for their well-child care visits as scheduled, and will receive clinic-based developmental screening and care coordination.
