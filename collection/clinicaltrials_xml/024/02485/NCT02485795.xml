  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of genetic testing on healthcare
      decisions and patient outcomes in interventional pain management clinical care. Results of
      genetic testing will also be compared with the clinical outcome measures collected to
      discover novel genetic factors that may influence patient care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific genetic variations have been identified that result in alteration of expression or
      function of receptors, enzymes, and transporters that are relevant to the safety and
      efficacy of a medical treatment. By providing information regarding the genetic risks and
      the most effective therapy for an individual patient, clinicians may improve the efficacy of
      treatment and decrease the risk of adverse events.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how currently available genetic tests are being
      implemented in various interventional pain management clinics around the United States, and
      whether this information results in benefits to patient care. Considering patient genotype
      correlates with pain sensitivity and perception, as well as autonomic nervous system
      dysfunction due to variations in sodium and potassium channels, genotypic associations can
      significantly improve outcomes in interventional pain management modalities including:

        -  Injections (also called nerve blocks using medications), such as steroids and opioids,
           including epidural steroid injections, facet joint injections, single nerve root
           blocks, and sacroiliac joint injections;

        -  Radiofrequency Rhizotomy (radiofrequency ablation and neuroablation), using x-ray
           guidance and a needle with an electrode at the tip that gets heated, to temporarily
           turn off a nerve's ability to send pain messages to the brain; and,

        -  Intrathecal pump implants which provide potent medications straight to the source of
           pain.

      Patient that are receiving Proove Bioscience's genetic testing will complete validated
      questionnaires to measure specific outcomes related to their treatment at each clinical
      visit, including medication efficacy, reduction in adverse drug events, and healthcare
      utilization. Physicians will document any changes made to treatment regimens, including
      adjustments to medications or non-pharmacological treatments, and any improvements in the
      outcome measures. Statistical analysis will be performed to calculate relationships between
      genotypic and phenotypic data points collected in this study.

      The results of this study will provide a measurable understanding of the medical and
      economic value of implementing genetic testing into interventional pain management.
      Furthermore, data points collected will be used to examine novel correlations and
      associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and longitudinal clinical outcome
      measures.
