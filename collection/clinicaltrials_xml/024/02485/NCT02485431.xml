    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, single-dose, randomized, 5-period crossover study designed
      to assess the comparative bioavailability and food effect of deflazacort. A total of 45
      subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 5 treatment sequences. Each dosing
      sequence will be enrolled in parallel and all subjects will receive all 5 treatments in a
      crossover fashion.
