    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of death among hospitalized patients, and is
      an important patient safety issue in plastic surgery. Previous work in plastic surgery has
      shown that enoxaparin prophylaxis can prevent many post-operative VTE events, and current
      American Society of Plastic Surgeons guidelines support enoxaparin prophylaxis for high-risk
      patients. However, the Plastic Surgery Foundation-funded Venous Thromboembolism Prevention
      Study showed that one in 25 highest risk patients still had a &quot;breakthrough&quot; VTE event
      despite receipt of guideline-compliant enoxaparin prophylaxis. Highest risk patients often
      have cancer or trauma reconstruction. These surgeries may have surgical injury that is equal
      in scope to patients with traumatic or thermal injury. Previous work in patients with
      traumatic or thermal injury has shown that enoxaparin metabolism, measured by anti-factor Xa
      (aFXa) level, is substantially increased: a higher degree of injury is associated with
      higher enoxaparin dose requirements to achieve prophylactic levels. &quot;Breakthrough&quot; VTE
      events may occur in plastic and reconstructive surgery patients due to inadequate enoxaparin
      dosing. The investigators will examine enoxaparin pharmacokinetics and will test whether a
      clinical protocol for real-time enoxaparin dose adjustment can favorably alter the
      proportion of patients with in-range aFXa levels. Primary outcomes will include 1) peak and
      trough steady-state aFXa levels in response to standard and escalated doses of enoxaparin
      and 2) the proportion of patients with appropriate aFXa levels before and after initiation
      of a clinical protocol for enoxaparin dose adjustment. The investigators expect that
      standard dosing will result in inadequate aFXa peak and trough levels, and that the clinical
      dose adjustment protocol will significantly improve the proportion of in-range aFXa levels.
      The investigators will also develop a linear regression-based equation to calculate, based
      on patient-level factors, the required dose of enoxaparin to generate in-range aFXa levels.
      This research may show that the current &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to enoxaparin
      prophylaxis is insufficient. In the trauma and orthopaedic populations, patients with low
      initial aFXa levels are significantly more likely to develop DVT. Thus, this research has
      important implications for appropriate enoxaparin dose magnitude and frequency, and may
      ultimately help to decrease the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with
      post-operative VTE.

    <description>Eligible patients will have steady state peak and trough anti-Xa levels drawn after the third enoxaparin dose. For patients in-range (levels 0.3-0.5IUmL), no intervention will be undertaken. For patients out of range, enoxaparin dose will be adjusted according to an established dose adjustment algorithm. Repeat levels will be checked after the third administration of the new dose.</description>
