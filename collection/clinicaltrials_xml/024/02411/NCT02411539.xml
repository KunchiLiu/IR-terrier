    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effect of an
      experimental human monoclonal antibody (mAb), VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01), in adults
      infected with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed as treatment for a variety of conditions
      including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infections. mAbs may also be a potential
      treatment for people infected with HIV. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of an experimental human mAb, VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01), in HIV-infected
      adults receiving ART. Study researchers will also evaluate the effect of VRC01 on the number
      of infected cells containing unspliced HIV-1 transcripts in the blood in participants.

      This study will enroll HIV-infected people 18 to 65 years old, who have been receiving ART
      for at least 2 years and who have a CD4+ count of 200 cells/mm^3 or greater. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Participants in Arm A will receive an
      intravenous (IV) infusion of VRC01 at Day 0 and Week 3 and an IV infusion of placebo at
      Weeks 6 and 9. Participants in Arm B will receive an IV infusion of placebo at Day 0 and
      Week 3 and an IV infusion of VRC01 at Weeks 6 and 9. Participants will record their
      temperature and symptoms for 3 days after each infusion. Study visits will occur at study
      entry (Day 0), and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, and 30. Study visits
      will include physical examinations, clinical assessments, and blood collection.
