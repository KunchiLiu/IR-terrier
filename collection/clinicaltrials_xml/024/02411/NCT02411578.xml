    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a small dose of glucagon (mini-dose glucagon)
      is effective for the treatment of non-severe hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are three phases included in this study: (1) Pre-crossover Trial Pilot Phase, (2)
      Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) Crossover Trial Phase, and (3) Post-Crossover Trial Phase.

        1. Pre-crossover Trial Pilot Phase:

           Prior to commencing the crossover trial, study enrollment will begin with a pilot phase
           for up to 6 participants to assess logistical and safety issues. Participants will have
           a screening visit followed by 2 weeks of home use of mini-dose glucagon to treat
           non-severe hypoglycemia or to prevent the development of hypoglycemia. At the
           completion of the 2 weeks, a clinic visit will occur.

           Following completion of this pilot phase, study results will be assessed to determine
           whether any changes in the crossover trial protocol are warranted.

           Participants in the pilot phase can participate in the crossover trial if eligibility
           criteria are met.

        2. Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) Crossover Trial Phase:

           The Crossover Trial Phase will start with a run-in phase of up to 48 participants for 2
           weeks followed by two (3-week) periods of the crossover trial.

           The Crossover Trial Phase will include 24 participants who complete these study
           periods. Participants who do not complete both periods or who do not have at least one
           event during both periods may be replaced.

           During the Crossover Trial Phase participants will be randomized into two groups: (1)
           Group A will use mini-dose glucagon in period 1 and oral glucose tablets in period 2
           and (2) Group B will use oral glucose tablets in period 1 and mini-dose glucagon in
           period 2. Each group with follow the applicable treatment arm according to their
           randomized group.

        3. Post-Crossover Trial Phase:

      The Post-Crossover Trial phase will commence upon completion of the second 3-week period of
      the Crossover Trial Phase. Participants will have a 3 week phase during which time they will
      decide how and when to use mini-dose glucagon or glucose tablets to treat non-severe
      hypoglycemia or to prevent hypoglycemia.

    <description>Definition: an event required assistance of another person due to altered consciousness, and required another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. This means that the participant was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat himself/herself, was unable to verbalize his/ her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, or experienced seizure or coma. These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. If plasma glucose measurements are not available during such an event, neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.
Severe hypoglycemia events will be tabulated by treatment group.</description>

Hyperglycemic events are classified as DKA if all of the following are present:
Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting
Serum ketones &gt;1.5 mmol/L or large/moderate urine ketones
Either arterial blood pH &lt;7.30 or venous pH &lt;7.24 or serum bicarbonate &lt;15
