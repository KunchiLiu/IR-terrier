      This study will be a multicenter (approximately 30 sites), randomized, vehicle-controlled,
      double-blind, and parallel group design. Approximately 264 subjects with moderate to severe
      plaque psoriasis will be randomized to treatment with DFD-06 Cream or Vehicle Cream.
      Subjects will use study product twice daily for 14 days. Subject visits are scheduled at
      Screening, Baseline (Day 1) and Days 4, 8, and 15. Clinical determinations of disease
      severity will be performed using the total sign score (TSS) for the target lesion and
      Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) for overall severity.

             protected health information collected for the study.

          2. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          3. Subject must present with a clinical diagnosis of stable (at least 3 months)
             plaque-type psoriasis.

          4. Subject with psoriasis involving 3% or greater BSA, not including the face, scalp,
             groin, axillae and other intertriginous areas.

             subject become sexually active. All women of childbearing potential must complete a
             urine pregnancy test (test must have a sensitivity of at least 25mIU/ml for human
             chorionic gonadotropin) at the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) and the test result must be
             negative to be eligible for enrollment.

          7. Subject must be in good general health as determined by the investigator and

          7. Have received treatment for any type of cancer within 5 years of the Baseline Visit
             except skin cancer and cervical cancer (in situ) are allowed if at least 1 year
             before the Baseline Visit.

          8. Use within 60 days prior to the Baseline Visit of: 1) systemic or topical

             treatment (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, hydroxyurea) or 3) oral retinoids (e.g.,
             acitretin, isotretinoin).

          9. Use within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit of: 1) systemic steroids, 2) PUVA
             therapy, 3) systemic anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil,
             sulfasalazine, 6-thioguanine), or 4) UVB therapy. Inhaled, intraocular, and
             intranasal steroids are allowed.

         10. Use within 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit of: 1) topical antipsoriatic drugs
             (e.g., salicylic acid, anthralin, coal tar, calcipotriene), 2) topical retinoids
             (e.g., tazarotene, tretinoin) or 3) topical corticosteroids.
