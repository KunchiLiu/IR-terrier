  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at an increased risk for damage to brain tissue
      due to their disease. The investigators are interested in how blood flow and cerebral
      inflammation are different in SCA patients and how that affects brain tissue- the
      investigators will use a relatively new set of dynamic MRI techniques to evaluate these
      parameters. The investigators will image participants with both SCA and matched controls
      with non-invasive MRI.

      Patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at increased risk for episodes of stroke, both
      overt clinically evident and subclinical lesions only seen on imaging, which have associated
      morbidity and mortality. In addition, SCA patients demonstrate relatively poorer cognitive
      performance compared to their peers without SCA that is believed to be related to the
      episodes of stroke, but may be present even in their absence.

      This study is designed to explore potential risk factors in patients with SCA that will
      identify predictors of cerebral damage that may also be modifiable. Elevated blood flow in
      cerebral arteries and increased inflammation are believed to be related to both ischemic
      lesions and cognitive findings but have not yet been clearly proven. We aim to use new MRI
      techniques which target cerebral blood flow and inflammation to identify differences in SCA
      patients and peers and follow this with an initial exploration of the association between
      these pathologic findings and cognitive deficits.

      The investigator does not assign specific interventions to the subjects of the study.
