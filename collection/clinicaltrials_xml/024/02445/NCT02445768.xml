      The purpose now is to:

        1. identify brain connections related to proprioception to have a better understanding of
           differences between people with stroke and healthy persons

        2. evaluate how these brain connections will change in people with stroke when they are
           engaged in a 6-week neurocognitive therapeutic program.

    <description>The robots will be used for research in healthy adults and stroke patients in the proposed studies below. The robots have been tested and cleared by the 3T safety committee at the CMRR, U of M. The first objective is a feasibility study to repeat the exercises with the robot in the 3T scanner at the U of M in 3 healthy adults and 3 individuals with stroke. The individuals with stroke will receive 6 weeks of therapy.</description>
