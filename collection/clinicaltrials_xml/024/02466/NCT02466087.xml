      The objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that magnesium supplementation will
      decrease depressive symptoms in adults.

      This study takes place over 12 consecutive weeks. While the investigators will follow the
      volunteers for the full 12 weeks volunteers will only take magnesium supplements for 6
      consecutive weeks. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to start the supplement at week 1 or
      week 7. Volunteers will take two supplement two times a day for a total of 248 mg elemental
      magnesium daily in the form of magnesium chloride. This amount of magnesium is less than the
      tolerable upper limit of 350 mg per day. The supplements will be provided. Volunteers will
      be asked to maintain their normal diet for the 12 weeks of the study.

      The primary outcome measure is the PHQ-9 questionnaire, a validated measure of depression.
      Secondary measures include the GAD-7 for Anxiety and side effects.
