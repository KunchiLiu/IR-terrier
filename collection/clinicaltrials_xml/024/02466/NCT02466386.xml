  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is male or female aged 4-5 years inclusive at the time of consent for an
             antecedent SPD489 trial in the preschool ADHD population.

          2. For &quot;A&quot; Subjects: Subject is on a known dose of SPD489 and completed the final visit
             of the treatment phase of an unblinded antecedent study without experiencing any
             clinically significant AEs that would preclude exposure to SPD489 and can directly
             enter this study without gap between the antecedent study and this study (defined as
             â‰¤3 days since last dose in the prior study), OR For &quot;B&quot; Subjects: Subject requires
             dose titration and completed at least the dose optimization and follow up of a
             blinded antecedent study without experiencing any clinically significant AEs that
             would preclude exposure to SPD489, OR For &quot;B&quot; Subjects: Subject completed the final
             visit of the treatment phase of an unblended antecedent study without experiencing
             any clinically significant AEs that would preclude exposure to SPD489, and did not
             enroll in this study within 3 days (i.e., &gt;3 days since last dose in the prior
             study).

          3. Subject's parent or LAR must provide signature of informed consent, and there must be
             documentation of assent (if applicable) by the subject indicating that the subject is
             aware of the investigational nature of the study and the required procedures and
             restrictions in accordance with the ICH GCP Guideline E6 (1996) and applicable
             regulations, before completing any study-related procedures.

          4. Subject and parent/LAR are willing and able to comply with all of the testing and
             requirements defined in the protocol, including oversight of morning dosing.
             Specifically, the same parent/LAR should be available to dispense the dose of
             investigational product for the study duration.

          5. For &quot;A&quot; Subjects: Subject has a satisfactory medical assessment with no clinically
             significant or relevant abnormalities as determined by physical examination findings
             or vital sign results that would preclude treatment with SPD489. For &quot;B&quot; Subjects:
             Subject has a satisfactory medical assessment with no clinically significant or
             relevant abnormalities as determined by physical examination findings clinical
             laboratory test results, ECG results, or vital sign results that would preclude
             treatment with SPD489.

          6. Subject has lived with the same parent or guardian for &gt;6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject was terminated from an antecedent SPD489 trial for non-compliance and/or
             experienced a SAE or AE resulting in termination from any previous SPD489 trial.

          2. Subject experienced any clinically significant AEs in any previous SPD489 trial that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude further exposure to SPD489.

          3. Subject is required to or anticipates the need to take medications that have central
             nervous system effects or affect performance, such as sedating antihistamines and
             decongestant sympathomimetics, or are monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Stable use of
             bronchodilator inhalers is not exclusionary.

          4. Subject has a concurrent chronic or acute illness (such as severe allergic rhinitis
             or an infectious process requiring antibiotics), disability, or other condition that
             might confound the results of safety assessments conducted in the study or that might
             increase risk to the subject. Similarly, the subject will be excluded if he or she
             has any additional condition(s) that, in the investigator's opinion, would prohibit
             the subject from completing the study or would not be in the best interest of the
             subject. The additional condition(s) would include any significant illness or
             unstable medical condition that could lead to difficulty complying with the protocol.
             Mild, stable asthma is not exclusionary.

          5. Subject has a documented allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to amphetamine or
             to any excipients in the investigational product.

          6. Subject has a known family history of sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmia.

          7. Subject has a blood pressure measurement &gt; 95th percentile for age, sex, and height
             at Visit 0.

          8. Subject has a known history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, advanced
             arteriosclerosis, structural cardiac abnormality, cardiomyopathy, serious heart
             rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems
             placing them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant
             drug.

          9. Subject has a current diagnosis of adjustment disorder, autism, psychosis, or bipolar
             disorder.

         10. Subject is currently considered at risk for suicide in the opinion of the
             investigator, has previously made a suicide attempt, or is currently demonstrating
             active suicidal ideation. Subjects with intermittent passive suicidal ideation are
             not necessarily excluded based on the assessment of the investigator.

         11. Subject has a history of seizures (other than infantile febrile seizures) or a
             current diagnosis of Tourette's Disorder.

         12. Subject has a chronic or current tic disorder that is judged by the investigator to
             be exclusionary

         13. Subject is taking any medication that is excluded per the protocol.

         14. For &quot;B&quot; Subjects only: Subject had any clinically significant ECG or clinical
             laboratory abnormalities at the Screening Visit (Visit -1).

         15. For &quot;B&quot; Subjects only: Subject has current abnormal thyroid function, defined as
             abnormal TSH and T4 at the Screening Visit (Visit -1) or Visit 0. Treatment with a
             stable dose of thyroid medication for at least 3 months is permitted
