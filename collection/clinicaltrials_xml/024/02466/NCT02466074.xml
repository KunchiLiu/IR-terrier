  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how improved cerebral blood flow affects the way in which newly
      formed MS lesions evolve into black holes. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will be
      treated with acetazolamide at different doses and obtain MRI to determine how much and in
      which regions of the brain cerebral perfusion improves.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral perfusion is altered in many disease states, including MS. Altered perfusion has
      been seen in patients with all multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes and is well established as
      occurring early in relapsing-remitting disease.

      There are currently several potent anti-inflammatory medications available to treat patients
      with MS. All of these disease modifying therapies (DMTs) decrease the potential for new
      injury to varying degrees. However, despite their anti-inflammatory properties, DMTs are not
      known to enhance cerebral perfusion. Acetazolamide (ACZ) is a generic medication with a
      well-established safety and tolerability profile that is known to enhance cerebral perfusion
      in healthy subjects.

      This study will utilize various imaging techniques to determine the degree to which cerebral
      blood flow is improved in MS subjects after administration of ACZ.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis using revised McDonald criteria

          2. Stable on either subcutaneous glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), interferon beta-1b
             (Betaseron, Extavia), or interferon beta-1a (Rebif) or intramuscular interferon
             beta-1a (avonex). The term &quot;stable&quot; implies that the subject has not had change in
             therapy for any reason for the 12 months prior to study entry.

          3. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0-6.0 inclusive

          4. Understood and signed written informed consent, obtained prior to the study subject
             undergoing any study related procedure, including screening tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or derivatives

          2. Known history of renal or hepatic disease, cerebrovascular disease including stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, angina or congestive heart failure.

          3. Evidence to suggest hyponatremia or hypokalemia, marked kidney dysfunction defined as
             creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL or liver disease dysfunction defined as aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than three-fold
             upper limit of normal (ULN).

          4. Evidence to suggest suprarenal gland failure.

          5. Evidence of hyperchloremic acidosis.

          6. Initiation of new immunosuppressant treatment after the subject becomes
             protocol-eligible (except for corticosteroids) or enrollment in a concurrent trial.

          7. Prior treatment with mitoxantrone, natalizumab, methotrexate, cladribine
             cyclophosphamide or other change in disease modifying therapy (DMT) within 6 months
             of initiation of study.

          8. Subjects with any history of cytopenia.

          9. History of pulmonary obstruction or emphysema.

         10. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or evidence of cirrhosis.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  Use, with every act of intercourse, of a diaphragm with contraceptive jelly
                  and/or condoms with contraceptive foam
