    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose study of
      ARC-520 in combination with entecavir or tenofovir administered to patients with HBeAg
      positive and immune active chronic HBV infection, who have been receiving ongoing entecavir
      or tenofovir therapy. Patients who have signed an Institutional Review Board/Ethics
      Committee-approved informed consent, and have met all of the protocol eligibility criteria
      will continue receiving daily oral entecavir (0.5-1.0 mg/day) or daily oral tenofovir (300
      mg/day) and either ARC-520 at 1.0 mg/kg or placebo for 3 total doses administered once every
      four weeks. Patients will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals during the
      study: medical history, physical examinations, vital sign measurements (blood pressure,
      heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), weight, adverse events assessment (AEs),
      echocardiograms, 12-lead ECGs, liver fibrosis testing, concomitant medication assessment,
      blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation, chemistry, Pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      exploratory Pharmacodynamic (PD) measures, HBV serology, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)
      testing (post-menopausal females) and pregnancy testing for females of childbearing
      potential. Patients will be monitored for a total of 21 weeks. Clinically significant
      changes including AEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes,
      until the event is otherwise explained, or until the patient is lost to follow-up.
