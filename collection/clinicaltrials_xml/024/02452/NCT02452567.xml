  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with a constellation of cardiometabolic abnormalities (including
      insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure and dyslipidemia) that are risk factors for
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight loss can improve all of the cardiometabolic
      abnormalities associated with obesity. Up to ~25% of lean people (Body Mass Index[BMI]
      18.5-24.9kg/m2) have many of the cardiometabolic abnormalities associated with obesity and
      are referred to as metabolically abnormal lean (MAL) people. However, the MAL phenotype is
      not well characterized and it is unclear whether weight loss has beneficial metabolic
      effects in already lean people. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to: 1) carefully
      phenotype MAL people and 2) evaluate the effect of moderate (8-10%) diet-induced weight loss
      in MAL people. This will be investigated in 15 MAL (defined as intrahepatic triglyceride
      (IHTG) content ≥5.6% and glycated hemoglobin ≥5.7%, or fasting plasma glucose concentration
      ≥100 mg/dl, or 2-hr oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose concentration ≥140
      mg/dl) men and women. Only lean people who have a BMI&gt;/= 21.0 but &lt;25.0kg/m2 will be asked
      to lose weight to avoid the risk that participants become underweight (BMI &lt;18.5kg/m2)
      during weight loss therapy..
