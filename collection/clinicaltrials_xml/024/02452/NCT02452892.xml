  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the relative effectiveness of 20 and 60 minutes of
      Low-Field Magnetic Stimulation in relieving symptoms in patients with major depression who
      are treatment resistant.

      The primary objective of this study:

        -  To compare the relative efficacy, as measured by a change in the 6-item Hamilton Rating
           Scale for Depression (HAM-D6), of 20 and 60 minutes of LFMS compared to sham (placebo)
           in subjects with treatment resistant depression (TRD).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine if subjects with TRD may respond to 120 minutes of LFMS.

        -  To determine the persistence of response to LFMS therapy during the observation period.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of LFMS.

        Inclusion Criteria: (Key)

          -  Meets the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, 5th Edition (DSM-5)
             criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), as determined by psychiatric

               4. Clinically significant DSM-5 Axis II disorder.

          -  Have ever received electroconvulsive therapy, vagal nerve stimulation, deep brain
             stimulation or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

          -  Have a non-removable programmable device or appliance such as cardiac pacemakers or
