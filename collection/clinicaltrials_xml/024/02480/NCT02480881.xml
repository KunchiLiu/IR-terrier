    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single sequence, 4-cycle, 4-treatment, drug-drug interaction (DDI)
      study in healthy female subjects on oral contraceptives (OC). There is no formal research
      hypothesis to be statistically tested. It is expected that coadministration of BMS-663068
      with OC will not affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of either ethinyl estradiol (EE) or
      norethindrone (NE).
