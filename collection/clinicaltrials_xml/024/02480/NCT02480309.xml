  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety, feasibility and efficacy of the Multiple Model Probabilistic
      Predictive Control / Diabetes Assistant (MMPPC/DiAS) system in full day and night
      closed-loop control in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes. This will be addressed
      in two parts. There will be an initial 36 hour inpatient study with hourly plasma glucose
      monitoring and scheduled exercise and meals. If the system is shown to be safe, feasible and
      effective, the study will proceed to supervised hotel studies with remote monitoring to test
      system use over 3 days/2 nights.

    <textblock>
      To further develop and refine an artificial pancreas system using the MMPPC framework that
      the investigators have developed. The MMPPC controller has been tested in a number of in
      silico studies as well as a small cohort of clinical studies. The controller is unique
      compared to other closed-loop systems in that it does not require meal announcement or a
      priming dose of insulin prior to a meal and is therefore a fully closed-loop system. Initial
      results were encouraging and the investigators achieved acceptable glucose control during
      the day and night.

      With this protocol, the investigators will further test the algorithm, as well how well the
      algorithm operates within an automated, portable closed-loop device, the DIAS in clinical
      studies. The DIAS system is able to use glucose sensor input and communicate to an insulin
      pump. The algorithm is incorporated within an Android phone, which determines insulin
      delivery. The studies will involve an initial inpatient phase, with frequent plasma glucose
      monitoring and proceed to supervised, remotely-monitored studies in a hotel setting.
