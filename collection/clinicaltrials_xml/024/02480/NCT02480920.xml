  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NOACs have several clinical and pharmacological advantages over warfarin however suboptimal
      adherence is one of the most common causes of failure to respond to medications and
      outcomes.

      This observational multicenter, retrospective study, will compose a national database of
      drug adherence and investigate the factors that affect drug adherence in patients taking new
      oral anticoagulation therapy in Turkey.

      Social support and adherence to therapy factors that may affect drug adherence and adverse
      events will be assessed by self-report questionnaires.

      Non-adherence will be tested for demographic, clinical, awareness of NOAC therapy and
      socioeconomic factors.
