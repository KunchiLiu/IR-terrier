      This study evaluates the safety of RejuvenAir Cryospray therapy to treat symptomatic chronic
      bronchitis patients with airflow restrictions.

      Prospective, open label, single arm study with sequential accrual of subjects with known
      chronic bronchitis. There are two phases to this study. Phase A will enroll up to 12
      subjects and will treat a single lobe to assess safety, feasibility and
      histology/immunology. After review of the data by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, Phase B
      of the study would begin. In Phase B of the study, Phase A subjects would have their
      remaining two lobes treated. In addition up to 24 subjects will be enrolled and will have
      all upper and lower lobes treated to assess safety, feasibility and immunology.
