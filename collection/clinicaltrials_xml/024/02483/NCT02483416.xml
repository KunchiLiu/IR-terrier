  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will take place over a period of 27 months. The recruitment phase will last
      approximately 24 months and each patient will participate for approximately 3 months.

      At the inclusion visit (D0), the investigator will ask the patient whether he would like to
      participate in the study and will obtain his written consent.

      Patients agreeing to participate will be randomised (3:1 ratio) and included in one of the
      following 2 groups:

      Group without `remote additional personalised nurse-led follow-up: patients will receive the
      healthcare given routinely by their medical team (100 patients).

      Group with `remote additional personalised nurse-led follow-up: patients will receive
      telephone calls from a nurse in addition to the healthcare given routinely by their medical
      team (300 patients).

      All the patients will be seen according to normal practice by the study medical team.

      Patients in the group with `remote additional personalised nurse-led follow-up will be
      contacted 8 times during the study (at D1, D7, D14, D21, D28, D44, D59 and D89). The nurse
      will make sure that the treatment takes place in good conditions; she cannot intervene in
      the medical care of the patient, nor give answer to the questions relative to the disease or
      to the treatment of the patient. The medical team remains the privileged contact of the
      patient.
