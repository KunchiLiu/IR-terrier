    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-063. TAK-063 is being tested to treat
      people who have schizophrenia. This study will look at the different symptoms associated
      with schizophrenia including cognitive symptoms, personal and social functioning and
      functional capacity in people who take TAK-063. The study will enroll approximately 160
      patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of
      the two treatment groupsâ€”which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor
      during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-063 20 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take the tablets once daily at nighttime. All participants
      will initially receive TAK-063, 20 mg/day. The dose may be titrated down to 10 mg/day, if
      intolerable.

      The multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 6 weeks. Participants will be hospitalized until the Week 3
      visit. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic during the treatment and 1 visit
      during the follow-up.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a clinician rated scale designed to assess global severity of illness. CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment. A participant is assessed on severity of mental illness on the following scale: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.</description>

    <description>The CGI-I assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening). The clinician is required to assess the participant's condition relative to baseline on a 7-point scale. CGI-I scale assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening) on a 7-point scale: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>

    <description>Responder based on CGI-I is defined as a rating of much improved or very much improved. The CGI-I assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening). The clinician is required to assess the participant's condition relative to baseline on a 7-point scale: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) at Week 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>BACS is specifically designed to measure treatment- related improvements in cognition and includes alternate forms. The battery of tests in the BACS includes brief assessments of reasoning and problem solving, verbal fluency, attention, verbal memory, working memory, and motor speed. The primary measure from each test of the BACS is standardized by creating z-scores whereby the mean of the test session of a healthy participant is set to 0 and the standard deviation set to 1. A composite score was calculated by averaging all of the 6 standardized primary measures from the BACS, and then calculating a z-score of the composite. The composite z-score indicates how much higher or lower the participant's cognition is compared to a healthy person.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) at Week 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The BNSS is a13-item instrument designed for use in clinical trials and other studies that measures 5 domains of negative symptoms: blunted affect, alogia, asociality, anhedonia, and avolition. All the items in the BNSS are rated on a 7-point (0-6) scale, with anchor points generally ranging from the symptom's being absent (0) to severe (6). A scale total score is calculated by summing the 13 individual items; total score range of 0 to 78, where higher score indicates higher severity of negative symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale at Week 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP scale is a clinician-reported outcome instrument that was developed to evaluate social and personal functioning. It measures 4 domains of social functioning: socially useful activities including work and study, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. The clinician assigns an initial 6-degree of severity to each area (absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe or very severe). The final result is a single assessment of social functioning ranging from 0 (no autonomy) to 100 (excellent functioning).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the University of California San Diego Performance-based Skills Assessment - Brief Version (UPSA-B) at Week 3 and 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 3 and 6</time_frame>
    <description>The UPSA evaluates the abilities of individuals to perform everyday tasks that are considered necessary for independent functioning in the community. The UPSA uses role playing situations to evaluate skills in 5 areas: household chores, communication, finance, transportation, and planning recreational activities. Subscale scores range from 0 to 20 points, and total scores range from 0 to 100 points; higher scores reflect better performance.</description>
