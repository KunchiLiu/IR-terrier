  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the a novel device called NovaCross to
      help cross Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) lesions in coronary arteries.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the NovaCross™
      micro-catheter when used to facilitate crossing of Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) lesions in
      coronary arteries. The procedure will be conducted on consenting patients diagnosed with a
      CTO in a coronary vessel that requires revascularization after a previously failed attempt
      to cross or refractory to 10 minutes of conventional guidewire attempt.
