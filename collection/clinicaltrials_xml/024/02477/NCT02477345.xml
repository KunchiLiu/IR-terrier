    <textblock>
      This protocol involves the compassionate use of intravenous fish oil infusion, Omegaven. The
      protocol involves infants and children with parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease to
      enable the reversal of elevated serum liver enzymes and direct bilirubin (cholestasis).

    <textblock>
      In the United States, patients dependent upon parenteral nutrition (PN) receive parenteral
      fat emulsions composed of soybean oils. Lipids are necessary in PN dependent patients due to
      their high caloric value and essential fatty acid content. Intravenous lipid emulsions have
      been implicated in predisposing patients to PN associated liver disease. Phytosterols such
      as those contained in soybean oils are thought to have a deleterious effect on biliary
      secretion. Accumulation of lipids in the hepatic Kupffer cells may further impair liver
      function.

      Omega 6 fatty acid emulsions prevent fatty acid emulsions prevent fatty acid deficiency, it
      is thought that they are not cleared in a manner similar to enteral chylomicrons and
      therefore accumulate in the liver and resulting in steatotic liver injury (neonatal
      cholestasis). It is hypothesized that a fat emulsion comprised of omega 3 fatty acids (i.e.:
      fish oil), such as de novo lipogenesis, the reduction of arachidonic acid-derived
      inflammatory mediators, prevention of essential fatty acid deficiency through the presence
      of small amounts of arachidonic acid, and improved clearance of lipids from the serum.
      Animal studies have shown that IV fat emulsions such as fish oil that are high in
      eicosapentaenic and docosahexaenoic acid reduce impairment of bile flow which is seen in
      cholestasis caused by conventional fat emulsions. Furthermore, intravenous omega-e fatty
      acids are well tolerated and might reduce the hepatic dysfunction. By administering Omegaven
      in place of conventional phytosterol/soybean fat emulsion, the progression of PN-associated
      cholestasis can be prevented or reversed.

Maximum dose may be decreased at the discretion of the investigators. Omegaven will be infused intravenously through either central or peripheral catheter alone or in conjunction with parenteral nutrition.
If additional fat calories are needed, if possible, will be provided via the enteral route.

    <description>Omegaven will be initiated at a dose of 0.5 gram/Kg/day and is infused over 24 hours for 1-2 days, and then advanced to
1 gram/Kg/day. Omegaven will be infused intravenously through either a central or peripheral catheter alone or in conjunction with parenteral nutrition. Omegaven will continue until weaned from PN. Monotherapy with Omegaven can continue as an additional source of calories after the dextrose/protein portion of PN is discontinued. Omegaven may be restarted within seven days of discontinuing therapy. After seven days, and meeting inclusion criteria, Omegaven can resume at the initial dose of 0.5 grams/Kg/day, advancing to 1 gm/kg/day.</description>
