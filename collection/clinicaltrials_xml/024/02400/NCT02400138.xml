    <textblock>
      Weakness of the respiratory muscles demonstrated by individuals with stroke, may generate
      important symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnea. Since adequate strength of the inspiratory
      and expiratory muscles is required, mainly when performing physical activities,
      rehabilitation interventions for stroke subjects should include respiratory training. This
      study will test the hypothesis that home-based combined training of the inspiratory and
      expiratory muscles is effective in improving strength and endurance of the inspiratory and
      expiratory muscles, fatigue, exercise capacity, and quality of life with stroke subjects.
      For this clinical trial, people after stroke will be randomly allocated into either
      experimental or control/sham groups. The experimental group will undertake training of the
      inspiratory plus expiratory muscles with the Threshold device regulated at 40% of the
      subjects' maximal inspiratory and expíratory pressure values, five times/week over eight
      weeks during 30 minutes/day. The control group will undertake the same protocol, but the
      participants will receive the threshold devices without the resistance valves. At baseline,
      post intervention, and four and 12 weeks after the cessation of the interventions,
      researchers blinded to group allocations will collect the following outcome measures:
      maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, endurance, fatigue, dyspnea sensation,
      exercise capacity, and quality of life.

      Rationale: Weakness of the respiratory muscles demonstrated by individuals with stroke, may
      generate important symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnea. Since adequate strength of the
      inspiratory and expiratory muscles is required, mainly when performing physical activities,
      rehabilitation interventions for stroke subjects should include respiratory training.

      Aim: This study will test the hypothesis that home-based combined inspiratory muscular
      training (IMT) plus expiratory muscular training (EMT) program is effective in improving
      strength and endurance of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles, fatigue, exercise
      capacity, and quality of life (QoL) with stroke subjects.

      Design: For this prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial, people after stroke
      will be randomly allocated into either experimental or control/sham groups. The experimental
      group will undertake training of the inspiratory plus expiratory muscles with the Threshold®
      IMT and the Threshold™ PEP regulated at 40% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory pressure
      (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) values, five times/week over eight weeks during
      30 minutes/day. The control group will undertake the same protocol, but the participants
      will receive the threshold devices without the resistance valves. At baseline, post
      intervention, and four and 12 weeks after the cessation (two follow-ups) of the
      interventions, researchers blinded to group allocations will collect all outcome measures.

      Study outcomes: Primary outcomes will be MIP and MEP. Secondary outcomes will include
      inspiratory and expiratory endurance, fatigue, dyspnea sensation, exercise capacity, and
      QoL.

    <description>Respiratory training will include training of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles five times per week over eight weeks, divided into three five-minute sessions of inspiratory training and the same doses of expiratory training, totaling 30 minutes of training. The training program will follow previously employed protocols for stroke survivors and will be carried-out with the Thresholds regulated at 40% of the subjects' maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure values.</description>

    <description>The control/sham group will underwent exactly the same protocol and bi-weekly monitoring at home, but the participants will receive the threshold devices with the minimum resistance of the spring, which will be also concealed. The control group will also attend the bi-weekly sessions and undergo the same procedures, except for the load adjustments. If the training proves to be effective, the control subjects will be informed and have the choice to receive the training with proper loads.</description>
