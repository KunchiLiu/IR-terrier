      This study investigates the efficacy and safety of an IV iron Injectafer in the treatment of
      iron deficient patients with fibromyalgia. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive Injectafer or Placebo on days 0 and 5. All treated subjects will be
      followed for efficacy and safety for 42 days.

      This is a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. All subjects who meet the inclusion
      requirements and no exclusion criteria will be entered into an up to 14 day screening phase.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Injectafer or Placebo on days
      0 and 5. All treated subjects will be followed for efficacy and safety for 42 days. Subjects
      will visit the clinic on days 0 and 5 for treatment, and then on days 14, 28, and 42. The
      subject's participation in the study will be for approximately 42 days from day 0.
