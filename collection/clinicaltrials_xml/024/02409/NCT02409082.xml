    <textblock>
      The investigators explore the presence of AD factors beta-amyloid and tau in CSF and plasma
      to verify AD diagnosis in patients with acute hip fracture. Clinical dementia test is
      performed prior to operation. Blood samples and CSF samples are collected at surgery and
      blood samples are collected postoperatively at intervals. Mortality is assessed at 30 days,
      3 months and 1 year. Morbidity is assessed at , 3 months and &gt;1 year. Neuromarkers
      specifically addressing the inflammatory component are to be analyzed and correlated to
      outcome together with AD markers, as above.

      The hypotheses explored in this investigation is that patients being pre-AD or having AD
      have worse prognosis following an acute hip fracture. This has been demonstrated in
      retrospective studies. In this study we admit all patients with a hip fracture planned tro
      receive a spinal anesthesia. Our golden standard of anesthesia in this patient cohort.
      Preoperatively Clinical Dementia Score is assessed after study inclosure. At the performance
      of the spinal dosage is standardized. Prior to giving this 5 ml of CSF is collected and
      blood is collected. Blood is then collected at intervals up until day 3 postoperatively. We
      plan to analyze beta-amyloid and tau in CSF and plasma to verify AD diagnosis in patients
      with acute hip fracture. Mortality is assessed at 30 days, 3 months and 1 year. Morbidity is
      assessed at, 3 months and &gt;1 year. Neuromarkers specifically addressing the inflammatory
      component are to be analyzed and correlated to outcome together with AD markers, as above.
