    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to build a library of prospectively collected clinical data
      from subjects with iron overload examined with commercially available MRI devices. This data
      library is intended for use in future engineering development and other research activities,
      including future regulatory submissions. Data from human subjects is required to develop and
      test Magnetic resonance (MR) reconstruction techniques that can provide quantitative
      information about tissue properties, such as volumetric fat and iron concentrations.
      Collection of MR data and corresponding quantitative liver iron concentration (LIC) data is
      necessary for development of MR techniques that can show both overall and regional iron
      concentrations of in vivo tissues. These techniques may provide viable alternatives to
      invasive and expensive conventional liver biopsy and to less accurate serum biomarker
      testing, potentially benefiting future clinical patients with iron overload.

      MR image data and corresponding quantitative data about serum and liver iron levels will be
      collected from each subject in this study. These datasets are considered suitable for future
      development and testing of MR reconstruction software, including MR reconstruction
      algorithms developed by General Electric Healthcare (GEHC) to use Longitudinal relaxation
      rate equal to the reciprocal of T2 relaxation time (1/T2) (R2) techniques to assess LIC. To
      achieve a sufficiently diverse library for future testing, MRI data of the liver and
      surrounding tissues will be acquired using 1.5T and 3.0T GEHC IDEAL IQ scans and
      commercially available 1.5T MRI scans conducted according to the FerriScan® Specialized
      Reconstruction Service guidelines (Resonance Health, Claremont, AU). Quantitative
      hematologic (serum ferritin) based on blood testing and FerriScan® Analysis Service LIC
      reports will be collected for each subject.
