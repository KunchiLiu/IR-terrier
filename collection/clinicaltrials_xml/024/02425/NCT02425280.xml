      This study aims to understand how war trauma affects children's and adolescents' memory
      functions and mental health, and whether Narrative Exposure Therapy is effective in
      enhancing optimal memory functions and alleviating mental health problems. The study
      analyzes the mental health and cognitive and emotional healing mechanisms of therapeutic
      intervention among war-affected children and adolescents.
