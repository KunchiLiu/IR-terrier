  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, to be conducted
      at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

      The objective of our research is to determine whether inhibition of the tumor necrosis
      factor- alpha (TNF-a) pathway by Pentoxifylline reduces inflammatory markers in AP and
      whether it is safe, beneficial and well-tolerated in patients with acute pancreatitis AP.
      The study will have 2 groups of 75 patients each, all with AP, randomly assigned to either
      the drug or a placebo, which looks like the drug, for a period of 3 days or until the time
      they are discharged, if hospital discharge is within 7 days of admission. The levels of
      markers of inflammation of C-reactive protein (C-RP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8
      (IL-8) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a) will be measured at baseline and on 5
      successive days or until the time of discharge, whichever occurs earlier.

      Subjects will be adult patients =18 years or older admitted to the hospital within 72 hours
      of diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) as defined by at least two of the following: (1)
      amylase and/or lipase greater than 3x upper limit of normal, (2) characteristic
      cross-sectional imaging, (3) typical abdominal pain. Enrollment into the study should take
      place 24 hours of admission.

      Determination of group size was based on the previous pilot study to decrease any of the
      important adverse outcomes, providing for a dropout rate of 10% during the study. During
      2012, 263 patients with AP were admitted to this institution, which possesses the needed
      infrastructure for successful completion of clinical drug intervention trials.

      Participants will be put in one of two groups (randomized) by chance (as flip of a coin).
      This is done so that neither participant nor the investigator will know which group you are
      in.

      Subject will be in either the treatment group (Pentoxifylline medication) or the control
      group (Placebo). Placebo is a matching pill that has no medication in it.

      Participant will take a pill orally (by mouth) starting from the time of admission and
      enrollment. Participant will receive a total of 9 doses over the three days of
      hospitalization (72 hours).

      Research blood draws will be done to be measured at baseline and on 5 successive days or
      until the time of discharge, whichever occurs earlier.

      The research blood draws can be done at the time of standard patient care blood draws, when
      a little extra (10 mL or 2 teaspoons) is drawn for the research.

      Information from participant 's medical record will be gathered while hospitalized and after
      dismissal. The study will continue to gather clinical follow up information up to 4 months
      following hospitalization regarding the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

    <description>Pentoxifylline is a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which raises intracellular cAMP, activates PKA, inhibits TNF and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. In addition, pentoxifylline improves red blood cell deformability (known as a haemorrheologic effect), reduces blood viscosity and decreases the potential for platelet aggregation and thrombus formation.Pentoxifylline is also an antagonist at adenosine 2 receptors</description>
