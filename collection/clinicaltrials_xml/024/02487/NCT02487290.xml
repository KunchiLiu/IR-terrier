  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a non-randomized, multi-center safety and feasibility trial of Aneufix ACP-T5
      to treat patients with Isolated type II endoleak in the presence of a non-shrinking AAA sac
      following an EVAR procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational device is called Aneufix, more specifically the model ACP-T5, which is a
      product treating the endoleak by blockage of backflowing blood vessels, i.e. by filling the
      'endoleak void and nidus of feeding artery and exit of existing draining arteries'.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Persistent type IIa or IIb endoleak (more than 6 months post-EVAR or
             post-embolization procedure); AND

          2. Volume of the 'endoleak void' can be determined upfront; AND

          3. An EVAR without circulatory complications; AND

          4. An endoleak confirmed by CT scan in preceding 6 weeks demonstrating the high
             likelihood of the isolated nature of the endoleak; AND

          5. An aneurysm sac either growing in contours after EVAR (per European Guidelines) or
             being stable in size (non-shrinking sac) as documented in the preceding 6 weeks by
             means of echo (or alternative visualization technique); AND

          6. An aneurysm sac that can be punctured in translumbar approach ; AND

          7. Possibility to withhold anti-thrombogenic medication temporarily; AND

          8. Ability and willingness to undergo the translumbar procedure under local anesthesia
             in a CT scan; AND

          9. Be older than 45 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient not able or willing to give written Informed Consent; OR

          2. Patient undergoing emergency procedures; OR

          3. Patient with traumatic vascular injury; OR

          4. Patient with hemostatic disorder or who is clinically unstable; OR

          5. Patient with a too high risk of abdominal sac rupture to allow safe radiological and
             scanographic assessments; OR

          6. Patient who is allergic to contrast media or anticoagulants; OR

          7. Patient with renal impairment (serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl or &gt; 176 mmol/l); OR

          8. Patient who is participating in another trial with an investigational drug or medical
             device; OR

          9. Patient with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.
