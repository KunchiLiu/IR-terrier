    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in
      HIV-infected adults who are virologically suppressed and who are on antiretroviral therapy
      (ART).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ruxolitinib is a medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      myelofibrosis, a disorder in which bone marrow is replaced by scar (fibrosis) tissue. Many
      of the cytokines affected by myelofibrosis are also affected by HIV. Because of this,
      ruxolitinib may also be a possible treatment for HIV. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in HIV-infected adults who are on ART
      and who are virologically suppressed. Researchers will evaluate the effect ruxolitinib has
      on inflammation and immune activation.

      This study will enroll HIV-infected adults who are on select ART regimens and who have viral
      suppression. ART will not be provided by the study; participants will continue to receive
      ART from their own health care providers. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      either ruxolitinib (Arm A) or no study treatment (Arm B). Participants in Arm A will receive
      ruxolitinib twice a day for 5 weeks. All participants will attend study visits at entry (Day
      0) and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 12. These visits will include physical examinations,
      clinical assessments, blood collection, adherence assessments, oral swab collection, and
      pregnancy testing for female participants. At Weeks 1 and 4, participants in Arm A will take
      part in pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling, which will involve having blood drawn several times
      over 6 to 8 hours.

             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, or historical plasma HIV-1
             RNA viral load. More information on this criterion is available in the protocol.

                  depending on the assay) using an FDA-approved assay with a quantification limit

             that could lead to pregnancy, must agree to use at least one reliable method of
             contraception while receiving the study drugs and for 7 weeks after stopping the
             medications. Acceptable forms of contraceptive include:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

             concomitant therapy

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drug or
             their formulation

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements

          -  Acute or serious illness or infection requiring systemic treatment and/or
             hospitalization within 60 days prior to entry

          -  Vaccinations (other than influenza) less than or equal to 45 days prior to the study
             entry visit. NOTE: Influenza vaccine is permitted. Participants are encouraged to get
             this vaccine greater than or equal to 7 days prior to the study pre-entry visit.

          -  Use of immunomodulators (e.g., interleukins, interferons, cyclosporine), systemic
             cytotoxic chemotherapy or investigational therapy less than or equal to 60 days prior
             to study entry

          -  Any current diagnosis or past history of a significant pulmonary, neurologic,
             cardiac, renal, or hepatic disorder prior to study entry, excluding treated HIV or
             treated hypertension. Diagnoses that would lead to exclusion include, but are not
             limited to the following:

               -  CDC category C AIDS-indicator conditions

               -  NOTE A: Except HIV encephalopathy, HIV wasting, esophageal candidiasis, or
                  pneumocystis pneumonia without dissemination.

               -  NOTE B: List available: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00018871.htm

               -  Herpes zoster (dermatomal or non-dermatomal). NOTE: A history of prior

               -  A medical disorder that predisposes to bleeding

               -  NOTE: If a site investigator is unsure of whether a history of a significant
                  medical or psychiatric condition should lead to participant exclusion, the
                  investigator should err on the side of safety if s/he believes that an active or
                  clinically resolved disorder may put the participant at risk from participation
                  in the study, influence the results of the study, or affect the participant's
                  ability to participate. If still uncertain, then the site should contact the
                  protocol team (actg.corea5336@fstrf.org) to assist in a determination.

          -  Change in the ART regimen within 12 weeks, inclusive, prior to study entry or
             intended modification of ART during the study. NOTE: Modifications of ART doses
             during the 12 weeks prior to study entry are permitted. In addition, the change in
             formulation (e.g., from standard formulation to fixed-dose combination) is allowed
             within 12 weeks prior to study entry. A within class single drug substitution (e.g.,
             switch from nevirapine to efavirenz or from atazanavir to darunavir) is allowed
             within 12 weeks prior to study entry, with the exception of a switch between any
             other NRTI to/from abacavir. No other changes in ART within the 12 weeks prior to
             study entry are permitted. However, participants need to be receiving (and
             tolerating) an allowable (for study purposes) ART regimen for at least 4 weeks prior
             to study entry.

          -  History of untreated latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnosed by tuberculin
             skin test or interferon gamma release assay. LTBI treatment would consist of 9 months
             of isoniazid or an equivalent therapy completed at least 4 weeks prior to study
             entry.
