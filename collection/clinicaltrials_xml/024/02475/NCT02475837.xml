      The Objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine if vorapaxar safely improves arteriovenous (AV) fistula functional
           maturation when administered during the maturation process compared with placebo.

        2. To determine if vorapaxar safely improves AV fistula patency, allowing for secondary
           procedures to aid in fistula maturation compared with placebo.

        3. To determine if vorapaxar safely facilitates successful cannulation of AV fistulas for
           hemodialysis compared with placebo.

      This is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind pilot trial. Study procedures will be
      conducted at Stanford University Medical Center, and standard-of-care (SOC) procedures will
      be conducted at Stanford and it's affiliated hospitals (Veteran's Affairs Palo Alto Health
      Care System and the Stanford Vascular Surgery Clinic at Valley Medical Center). The
      investigators expect to enroll 128 patients. Patients will be assigned to treatment groups
      with a 1:1 randomization in blocks of 4 at the conclusion of the AV fistula creation.
      Patients will be stratified based on fistula location (lower arm versus upper arm).

      Objectives:

        1. To determine if vorapaxar safely improves arteriovenous (AV) fistula functional
           maturation when administered during the maturation process compared with placebo.

        2. To determine if vorapaxar safely improves AV fistula patency, allowing for secondary
           procedures to aid in fistula maturation compared with placebo.

        3. To determine if vorapaxar safely facilitates successful cannulation of AV fistulas for
           hemodialysis compared with placebo.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Vorapaxar initiated the day following AV fistula creation will result in improved
           fistula functional maturation without increased risk of bleeding or other major adverse
           events.

        2. Vorapaxar initiated the day following AV fistula creation will result in improved
           fistula patency and will increase the utility of secondary procedures to aid in fistula
           maturation, without increased risk of bleeding or other major adverse events.

        3. Vorapaxar initiated the day following AV fistula creation will facilitate successful
           cannulation of AV fistulas for hemodialysis without increased risk of bleeding or other
           major adverse events.

      Background:

      End-stage renal disease affects nearly 500,000 persons in the US and more than 2 million
      persons worldwide. In the US and most developed countries, hemodialysis is the predominant
      dialytic modality. While effective at sustaining life for most patients, hemodialysis rarely
      restores health. Roughly one in five patients on dialysis die each year; patients who
      survive experience poor functional status, impaired physical and cognitive function and
      severely impaired health-related quality of life. Moreover, the cost of the ESRD program
      exceeds $40B in the US annually.

      Hemodialysis vascular access is often referred to as the 'Achilles Heel&quot; of dialysis care.
      The Brescia-Cimino (radiocephalic end-to-side) fistula is considered to be the gold standard
      vascular access; upper arm arteriovenous fistulae are often created instead.
      Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts are next best, but are frequently complicated by graft
      &quot;thrombosis,&quot; commonly caused not by hematologic abnormalities, but rather by intimal
      hyperplasia at the venous anastomosis. Unfortunately, the majority of patients have
      insufficient time to undergo pre-emptive creation of an arteriovenous fistula or graft, and
      most patients start hemodialysis with either a temporary or &quot;semi-permanent&quot; tunneled
      catheter, often placed in one of the internal jugular veins.

      For patients who do undergo fistula creation, either in advance of (optimally) or after
      starting hemodialysis, a sizeable fraction of arteriovenous fistulae never mature
      sufficiently to be usable for hemodialysis. It is common for patients to undergo three or
      more attempts at fistula creation, extending the time during which they experience a
      heightened risk of infection and venous stenosis/thrombosis of the internal jugular veins or
      in some cases other complications including superior vena cava syndrome. Therapeutic agents
      that could facilitate maturation of arteriovenous fistulae could vastly improve the health
      and well-being of patients on hemodialysis, and could well result in enhanced survival.

      Preliminary Data

      Numerous small studies have attempted to improve short- and longer-term function of
      arteriovenous fistulae and grafts with a variety of therapeutic agents, including warfarin,
      aspirin, fish oil, dipyridamole and several newer antiplatelet agents, including ticlopidine
      and more recently clopidogrel. In order to address the pressing need for improved outcomes,
      the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and
      Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) assembled the &quot;Dialysis Access Consortium&quot; more than 10 years ago -
      a consortium of highly qualified investigators whose aim was to design two major clinical
      trials to address failure of arteriovenous fistulae and grafts, respectively. Dr. Chertow
      served on the Data Safety and Monitoring Board for both of the DAC trials.

      The DAC investigators conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of clopidogrel in
      patients receiving arteriovenous fistulae (another trial examining arteriovenous grafts will
      not be discussed here). Interestingly, clopidogrel was shown to enhance short-term patency
      of arteriovenous fistulae, but failed to result in improved maturation, sufficient for the
      fistula to be consistently used for maintenance hemodialysis. Roughly six of 10 patients
      assigned to the trial (all at outstanding clinical centers) failed to have a usable fistula
      at 3-4 months, highlighting the need for more effective therapy. Despite the DAC fistula
      study having been stopped prematurely for &quot;efficacy&quot; (on the primary outcome of early
      fistula patency), few patients receive clopidogrel for this purpose in clinical practice.

      Vorapaxar, Cardiovascular Disease and ESRD

      PAR-1 receptors are expressed by platelets, endothelial cells and atheromatous plaques
      suggesting important roles in tissue response to injury, inflammation and thrombosis.
      Vorapaxar may have a role in preventing vascular access complications.

      Vorapaxar has been studied in two large cardiovascular outcome trials - TRA-2P and TRACER.
      In both trials, vorapaxar reduced the composite of CV death, MI and stroke with an excess in
      bleeding. Patients with renal dysfunction were not excluded. Vorapaxar has been approved by
      the FDA for secondary prevention in patients with stable cardiovascular disease. Recent
      analyses from TRACER showed non-heterogeneity of treatment effects on safety and efficacy
      outcomes in patients with and without renal dysfunction (Mahaffey KW, ESC abstract
      presentation) Additionally, Kosoglou et al. showed in a relatively small study that the
      pharmacokinetics of vorapaxar were not altered by ESRD, suggesting that dosing could proceed
      without modification in this population.

      This is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind pilot trial. Study procedures will be
      conducted at Stanford University Medical Center, and standard-of-care (SOC) procedures will
      be conducted at Stanford and it's affiliated hospitals (Veteran's Affairs Palo Alto Health
      Care System and the Stanford Vascular Surgery Clinic at Valley Medical Center). The
      investigators expect to enroll 128 patients. Patients will be assigned to treatment groups
      with a 1:1 randomization in blocks of 4 at the conclusion of the AV fistula creation.
      Patients will be stratified based on fistula location (lower arm versus upper arm).

      Recruitment and Screening: Recruitment will be by invitation and referral from individuals'
      treating physicians at Stanford, Valley Medical Center, and VA Palo Alto. Generally, initial
      screening will be performed at the time of consultation for dialysis access. Patients who
      appear to meet the study criteria and express interest in participation will be referred to
      the study team to be contacted for full screening.

      Participation in this study will not affect standard care of patients with AV fistulae
      receiving hemodialysis. The only additional treatment is administration of the study drug or
      placebo and additional monitoring, including one additional ultrasound, for 6 months.

      Adverse events reporting process: The PI will review aggregated AEs each month, and AEs will
      be reported to the sponsor and the IRB per research guidelines. Participation for the
      individual will terminate if they have a serious adverse reaction that prevents future
      participation. In the event of adverse effects, their primary physician will be notified.

      The investigators estimate 18 months will be required to recruit patients with an additional
      six months to complete follow-up of the last enrolled subject for a total of 24 months for
      recruitment and final assessments.

      Data management and statistical coordination of the study will be performed by members of
      the Quantitative Sciences Unit (QSU) in the Department of Medicine at Stanford University
      School of Medicine and in the Data Coordinating Center in the Department of Medicine. The
      REDCap data managements system will be used to create the data platform for storage of the
      clinical information.

      Vascular Ultrasound studies will be performed in the Vascular Center at Stanford University
      Hospital, an IAC-accredited vascular laboratory. Studies will be interpreted by the ordering
      vascular surgeon and reviewed by the Principal Investigator.

      Randomization codes will be generated in block size of 4 by a statistician in the QSU.

      Statistical analyses will be performed by MS level and PhD level statisticians in the QSU.
      Randomized treatment allocation will only be unblinded when all follow-up is complete, data
      have been cleaned and the trial statistician, Co-Investigators and Principal Investigator
      are in agreement.

      Variables/Time Points of Interest

      Primary Efficacy Outcome Time to AV fistula functional maturation (defined as successful
      cannulation of the AV fistula for six hemodialysis sessions within three weeks).

      Secondary Efficacy Outcomes

      AV fistula use within 180 days of surgery.

      AV fistula patency at 150-180 days, with at least 50% increase in vein diameter by
      ultrasound compared with preoperative vein diameter measurement.

      Safety Outcomes

      Bleeding events (GUSTO and BARC Criteria)

      BARC Bleeding Classification:

      Type 0: no bleeding

      Type 1: bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause the patient to seek unscheduled
      performance of studies, hospitalization, or treatment by a healthcare professional; may
      include episodes leading to self-discontinuation of medical therapy by the patient without
      consulting a healthcare professional

      Type 2: any overt, actionable sign of hemorrhage (e.g., more bleeding than would be expected
      for a clinical circumstance, including bleeding found by imaging alone) that does not fit
      the criteria for type 3, 4, or 5 but does meet at least one of the following criteria: (1)
      requiring nonsurgical, medical intervention by a healthcare professional, (2) leading to
      hospitalization or increased level of care, or (3) prompting evaluation

      Type 3 Type 3a Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of 3 to 5 g/dL* (provided hemoglobin drop
      is related to bleed) Any transfusion with overt bleeding

      Type 3b Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop 5 g/dL* (provided hemoglobin drop is related to
      bleed) Cardiac tamponade Bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control (excluding
      dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid) Bleeding requiring intravenous vasoactive agents

      Type 3c Intracranial hemorrhage (does not include micro-bleeds or hemorrhagic
      transformation, does include intraspinal) Subcategories confirmed by autopsy or imaging or
      lumbar puncture Intraocular bleed compromising vision

      GUSTO Bleeding Classification

      Severe: Bleeding* that was fatal, intracranial, or that caused hemodynamic compromise
      requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg that required blood or fluid
      replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support,** or surgical intervention).

      Moderate: Bleeding* requiring transfusion of whole blood or packed red blood cells without
      hemodynamic compromise (as defined above).

      Mild: Bleeding*: Bleeding without blood transfusion or hemodynamic compromise.

      *In all cases, bleeding must be clinically overt.

      **Need for vasopressor/inotropic support for hemodynamic compromise, even if blood pressure

      Statistical Methods:

      Descriptive statistics such as means, medians, standard deviations and interquartile ranges
      will be presented for continuous measurements, and frequency statistics will be presented
      for categorical characteristics. Graphical tools such as histograms and boxplots will be
      used to assess distributional aspects of continuous variables. Cumulative incidence plots
      will be derived to depict time to fistula use, stratified by treatment arm and fistula
      location.

      The primary outcome is time to AV fistula maturation, defined as successful cannulation of
      the AV fistula for six hemodialysis sessions within three weeks.

      Subjects who are lost to follow up or who die prior to maturation will be censored at the
      time of death or last recorded activity.

      The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. To that end,
      patients will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignment, and all
      patients randomized to treatment assignment will be included in the analysis even if they
      are lost to follow up or die before the end of their observation period. The investigators
      will use a log-rank test stratified by location of fistula to assess whether time to
      maturation of AV fistula differs between treatment arms (vorapaxar versus placebo). The test
      will be two-sided and conducted at the 0.05 level of significance.

      A Cox proportional hazards regression model of treatment arm and other covariates of
      interest will be employed secondarily to estimate an adjusted treatment effect.

      Other secondary analyses involve the use of logistic regression techniques to evaluate the
      effect of treatment on secondary endpoints - use of AV fistula within 180 days and AV
      fistula patency within 150-180 days.

      Power/Sample Size:

      The investigators have sufficient power to address the primary aim. Based upon a sample size
      of n=25 patients per group for this pilot study, the investigators have approximately 70%
      power to detect a hazard ratio of 2.05 between treatment arms, assuming that only 50% of
      subjects will experience maturation by six months post randomization in the placebo group.
      If only 40% of subjects experience maturation by six months post randomization the
      investigators have over 70% power to detect a hazard ratio of 2.15. With 90 patients the
      investigators would have 85% power to detect a HR of 2.35. With 128 patients the
      investigators would have 85% powered to detect a HR of 2.0.

      Merck will provide the study drug and matching placebo in study kits. At conclusion of the
      study or upon drug expiration, the Merck GRS will be responsible for issuing a Drug
      Disposition Letter to the investigator for US based studies. The study investigators will be
      responsible for the destruction of the supplies at the study center pursuant to the ICH/GCP
      Guidelines, local regulations and the investigator's institutional policies. The study
      investigators will responsible for keeping accurate records of the clinical supplies, the
      amount dispensed to and returned by the patients, and the disposition at the end of the
      study.

      A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprised of one vascular surgeon, one physician with
      expertise about vorapaxar and one experienced in clinical trials will review unblinded data
      after 10 patients have completed follow-up 6-month ultrasound and after 30 patients have
      completed follow-up 6-month ultrasound evaluation.

      Model study agreement will be used for reporting of adverse events. .
