  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the agreement in measurement of sperm
      concentration in human semen between lay users with TRAK and a recognized reference method.
      The study will also include the measurement of matched samples by TRAK when tested by
      healthcare professionals trained in use of the TRAK device.
