  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that children receiving human milk will maintain a greater
      diversity of helpful bacteria in their gut and have lower levels of inflammatory proteins in
      the blood compared with children not receiving human milk.

      The investigators hypothesize that the gut microbiota during bone marrow transplant could be
      influenced by administration of enteral donor breast milk. This study will attempt to
      address this hypothesis, by feeding donor breast milk to young children undergoing
      transplant, and serially comparing the gut microbiota in children receiving human milk, with
      those receiving conventional feeding.

    <description>Donor milk will be pasteurized prior to use.
Given orally or by nasogastric (NG) or nasojejunal (NJ) tube.
Feeding will be supervised and will be advanced as quickly as tolerated with a goal of providing 40-50% of nutritional needs from the donor milk.
It is recognized that the volume of enteral feeds will need to be adjusted per patient tolerance.</description>

If a nursing mother enrolls on the study, maternal and not donor milk will be given in the maximum volume possible with Prolacta supplementation if clinically indicated and recommended by the registered dietician.</description>
