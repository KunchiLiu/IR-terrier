    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare SYSTANE® HYDRATION to Hyabak 0.15% based on total
      ocular surface staining scores (TOSS) at Day 42.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will first be dispensed preservative-free 0.9% saline eye drops (saline eye drops)
      to be used during the Run-in phase between Screening Visit and Day 0 (Visit 1). Subjects who
      qualify will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive either treatment with SYSTANE®
      HYDRATION Lubricant Eye Drops or Hyabak 0.15% Eye Drops.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Total Ocular Surface Staining (TOSS) Score at Day 42</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The TOSS score is a cumulative cornea and conjunctival staining score. After instilling ophthalmic dye in the eye, the investigator grades 3 areas of the ocular surface for dryness on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0=Absent and 5=Severe. The 3 scores are summed for a resultant overall 0-15 score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in IDEEL Treatment Satisfaction Scores (effectiveness and inconvenience) at Day 42</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The IDEEL (Impact of dry eye on everyday life) is 10-question patient-reported outcome questionnaire that assesses the subject's general satisfaction with treatment use. A resultant overall 0-100 treatment satisfaction score is calculated, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction and less treatment-related bother.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Tear Film Break-up Time (TFBUT) at Day 42</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>TFBUT is defined as the time elapsed between eye opening after a blink and the appearance of the first break in the tear film, ie, dry area. A longer tear film break-up time indicates a more stable tear film and may lead to improvement in dry eye symptoms.</description>
