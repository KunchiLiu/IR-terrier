      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy of two types of NPWT systems;

        -  tNPWT systems that has successfully completed a coding verification request with CMS
           and has the following capabilities (e.g., range of negative pressure, connective
           tubing, canister, foam or gauze filler, and approved for home use) and,

        -  a portable, canister-less, battery operated, disposable single-use NPWT system (PICO)
           to see if there are any observed differences with regard to the clinical efficacy of
           the two devices.
