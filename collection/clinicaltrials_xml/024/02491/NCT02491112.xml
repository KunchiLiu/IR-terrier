    <time_frame>28 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical cure - absence of the signs or symptoms of tinea corporis (i.e. score of 0 using a 4-point severity score (0-none; 1-mild; 2-moderate; and 3-severe) for each of the individual signs of tinea corporis - erythema, scaling, pruritus).</description>
