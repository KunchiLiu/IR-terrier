    <textblock>
      The proposed study is planned to determine the potential role for regular fat dairy products
      in short-term metabolic control in younger and older adults and the metabolic flexibility in
      response to food components, which are areas that have not yet been explored. Subjects would
      be served with solid (cheese), semi-solid (yogurt) and liquid (milk) dairy products and skim
      milk (control) and water (non-caloric control), 2 hours before consumption of ad libitum
      pizza meal in 5 consecutive sessions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last 30 years, overweight and obesity have become characteristic of the majority of
      Canadians. Approximately 60% of adults in Canada are overweight or obese. The Canadian
      Health Measures Survey, conducted during 2007-2009, estimated prevalence of metabolic
      syndrome at 19.1% in the adult population. In addition, according to the 2010 Canadian
      Community Health Survey, 18.1% of Canadian adults have been reported obese. Along with the
      health burden, it has also brought about an estimated economic burden of $ 4.3 billion
      annually in 2001, which has likely doubled as of today.

      Metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes occur concurrently with insulin resistance marked by
      increased blood glucose levels at fasting and postprandial, glycosylated blood proteins
      leading to arterial damage, inflammation and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.
      Despite increased consumer interest in consuming foods that may help treat or prevent
      obesity and diabetes, effective countermeasures against metabolic diseases have yet to be
      established. Thus, food products that are capable of controlling parameters of metabolic
      diseases including blood glucose, insulin levels and food intake are in urgent need of
      investigation and identification. Dairy products are believed to hold this potential because
      of their functional physiological properties.

      There have been many observational and long-term clinical studies showing that regular
      consumption of dairy products correlate with a better body composition and a lower incidence
      of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Studies have also found that dairy proteins are more
      satiating than other types of proteins, and that they are effective in lowering the increase
      in glycemic response after high GI food intake, but most studies have been done in isolated
      proteins. Hence, the role of dairy proteins, in their conventional food form reflecting
      usual intake, on food intake and glycemia and their interactions with these metabolic
      diseases is of interest.

      From short-term studies done in our lab, the investigators have shown that dairy products
      can bring about benefits in glycemic control and food intake when consumed before or within
      ad libitum meals, which can be achieved by both insulin dependent and independent
      mechanisms. The investigators have shown that fluid milk products and yogurt improve
      post-meal glycemic excursions when consumed before or within an ad libitum meal by healthy
      young adults. Except the yogurt study conducted in our lab, there have been no other studies
      reporting the role of solid or semi-solid dairy products consumed before a meal, within a
      meal, immediately post-meal or as between meal snacks on glycemia and appetite control. Our
      study on yogurt showed that yogurts, especially those with high protein to carbohydrate
      ratio, reduced pre-meal glucose incremental areas under the curve. Further studies on solid
      and semi-solid dairy need to be conducted because milk, like other caloric beverages, lead
      to calorie accumulation if consumed before or with a meal even though it provides more
      nutrients, lowers post-meal blood glucose excursions and leads to greater post-meal satiety
      in young adults.

      Moreover, the evidence appears to be relatively consistent with respect to a beneficial role
      of low-fat dairy products in the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D), however, the role of
      regular/high-fat dairy is less clear. A number of cross-sectional and prospective
      epidemiological studies have identified a positive association between the intake of dietary
      fat and the risk for development of either insulin resistance or T2D20. More research is
      needed to better understand the role of regular-fat dairy products on food intake as well as
      of glycemic control.

      The proposed study investigates the effects of pre-meal regular fat; cheese, yogurt and milk
      on satiety, food intake and glycemia in normal weight or overweight/obese young adults
      (20-30yrs) .
