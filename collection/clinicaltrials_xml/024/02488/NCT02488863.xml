  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) represents the leading cause of disability worldwide, and the knee is
      the most commonly affected joint. Knee OA has been traditionally attributed to peripheral
      mechanisms, but peripheral damage, inflammation, and psychological factors have failed to
      significantly account for the presence, absence, or severity of chronic OA-related pain.
      Recent studies show that individuals with OA-related pain exhibit dysfunctional pain
      modulation supporting a significant central nervous system (CNS) contribution. However, the
      CNS mechanisms underlying these changes in pain modulation are not currently known, nor
      their relation to clinical pain progression. The proposed pilot examines brain circuits
      recently described in predicting the transition from acute to chronic pain, in predicting
      clinical and experimental pain changes as well as physical performance and mobility changes
      in older persons with knee OA pain over a one year period. The findings will provide novel
      and important information regarding the mechanisms underlying aberrant pain processing and
      its functional consequences in older adults with knee OA. The information learned can be
      subsequently used to target treatment and prevention strategies in future studies of older
      adults. The central hypothesis is that increased functional and structural connectivity of
      cortico-striatal regions will be significantly associated with baseline clinical and
      experimental pain and decreased physical function in persons with symptomatic knee OA and
      will account for more rapid clinical pain and disability progression overtime.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lifetime risk of developing symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) exceeds 40%, and OA
      prevalence is rising due to the increased age and obesity of the U.S. population.
      Historically, OA has been conceptualized as a regional pain condition whose symptoms are
      driven by peripheral pathophysiology. However, the poor correspondence between measures of
      disease severity and clinical symptoms suggests that factors above and beyond peripheral
      tissue damage must contribute to OA-related pain. Recent studies demonstrate generalized
      alterations of pain processing among individuals with OA. However, no investigator to date
      has examined the brain circuits that are the focus of this proposal in patients with
      symptomatic knee OA. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying OA-related
      changes in pain modulation will provide a basis for the development of targeted preventive
      and rehabilitative strategies. In light of evidence emphasizing plasticity of white matter
      connections, and the potential pain relieving effects of non-invasive brain stimulation
      interventions, it seems reasonable to identify these connections as potential targets for
      future treatment approaches. Given the expected growth of the older population, such
      strategies could have a monumental impact in reducing healthcare expenditures and improving
      quality of life of older adults.

    <time_frame>Change in baseline to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;TSA Thermal Sensory and Vibratory Sensory Analyzer (Model TSA II, VSA 3000) (Medoc. LTD)&quot; will be used in this study to quantify nerve fiber dysfunction with measurements of vibratory and thermal sensory thresholds (warm, cold, heat-induced pain, and cold-induced pain). A hand-held algometer (FDX, Wagner Instruments and/or Algomed, Medoc.LTD) will be used to assess pressure pain sensitivity. Vibratory threshold is tested with a vibratory pin, which presses the measured area with a consistent pressure of 50g. The vibratory sense analysis will be performed with two different types of stimuli: upward-moving (stimuli increases in intensity until a sensation is perceived) and downward-moving (stimuli decreases in intensity until no sensation is perceived). Several vibrations will be given sequentially and the mean end variance will be determined to verify the consistency of the test.</description>

LTD)&quot; will be used in this study to quantify nerve fiber dysfunction with measurements of vibratory and thermal sensory thresholds (warm, cold, heat-induced pain, and cold-induced pain). A hand-held algometer (FDX, Wagner Instruments and/or Algomed, Medoc.LTD) will be used to assess pressure pain sensitivity. Thresholds for light touch will be assessed with von Frey monofilaments, using two ascending and two descending stimulus series, according to the method of limits. Detection threshold at each test site will be determined by the obtaining the geometric mean across these four test series. The heaviest von Frey monofilament (300g) will also be applied at 1Hz for 10 seconds at each test site and participants will be asked to rate the pain they experience, if any.</description>

    <measure>Thermal Detection Thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in baseline to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Several trials will be performed for the sensory modality and a mean threshold will be calculated. For threshold determination the investigators will use a &quot;reaction time-inclusive&quot; method, the method of limits, consisting of continuously changing intensities of stimuli halted automatically by the subject at the moment that the requested sensation is perceived. The following thresholds will be evaluated using the TSA II: (1) cool sensation; (2) warm sensation; (3) cold pain; and (4) heat pain. Subjects will also be asked to qualify the sensation after it has been quantified.</description>

    <measure>Allodynia and Temporal Summation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in baseline to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic mechanical allodynia will be investigated using a soft brush and lightly brushing the skin of the hands and feet as well as any reported painful areas. If pain is evoked in the test area, the participant will be asked to rate the intensity of the pain. If an allodynic area is detected, temporal summation will be evoked by repetitively tapping the skin of the allodynic area with von Frey hairs (100g) at 1 Hz for 10 seconds. If temporal summation is evoked in the allodynic test area the participant will be asked to rate the intensity of the pain.</description>

    <description>Pressure is delivered by a hand-held algometer (spring-controlled device delivering calibrated pressure via a flat 10mm diameter rubber tip).

    <description>Physiological indices such as heart rate, skin temperature, and microvascular blood flow may be measured continuously and stored using a BIOPAC MP150 data acquisition system (BIOPAC Systems, Goleta, CA) during this session.
