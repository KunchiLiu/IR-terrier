  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if non-invasive measurements of brain waves from
      the skin called electroencephalography (EEG) can predict whether the brain stimulator will
      help your symptoms. Our goal is to obtain these brain wave measurements with patients both
      awake and under general anesthesia, and then to evaluate which brain wave patterns are
      associated with clinical improvement to determine if they could be useful for predicting
      whether the surgery will work. If such predictive measures were established based upon the
      findings of this study, they could be used in the future to improve surgical outcomes in the
      following ways: (1) to help guide surgical targeting in the operating room awake or under
      anesthesia, (2) to guide post-operative programming in clinic, and (3) and to develop
      potential feedback systems for &quot;automatic&quot; programming of the brain stimulator system at
      home.
