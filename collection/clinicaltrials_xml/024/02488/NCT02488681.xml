      Medtronic is sponsoring the Micra Continued Access (CA) study to provide continued access to
      the Micra System while the marketing application is under review by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA).

      The Micra CA study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, study designed to allow
      controlled access of the Micra system when used as intended. All subjects enrolled in the
      Micra CA Study will be prospectively followed from implant, at 6-month intervals until study
      closure (i.e. FDA approval). Patients with previous or existing inactive implanted cardiac
      stimulation systems will have additional follow ups.
