        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) or active neovascular age-related Macular Degeneration
             (nAMD) in at least one eye

          -  Current treatment with intravitreal LucentisÂ® therapy, with evaluations planned every
             4 to 8 weeks

          -  Best corrected visual acuity (Snellen assessed by glasses and/or contact lens) of
             20/100 or better in the study eye, with potential for vision recovery with
             standard-of-care treatment

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years

          -  Access to an approved mobile device with a data plan or WiFi internet access

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other eye condition causing eye disease that limits vision and cannot be
             corrected, other than Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) or neovascular age-related Macular
             Degeneration (nAMD).

          -  Dementia or other neurologic or psychological limitation that would prevent the
             patient from performing regular self-testing of visual function.
