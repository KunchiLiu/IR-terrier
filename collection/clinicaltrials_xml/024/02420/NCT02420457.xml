      The investigators are assessing the validity of fitness devices as surrogate measures of
      chronic pain survey outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are attempting to validate the usage of personal fitness trackers against
      the classical survey tools used. These devices are known to be of use in measuring activity
      and sleep in healthy patients but their use in chronic pain patients has not been assessed.
      This study will follow participants with chronic back pain undergoing treatment to see if
      changes in clinical course can be captured with these fitness devices.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain scores as measured by VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Over two to four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed by using VAS where scores range from 0 = no pain to 100 = worst possible pain. An increase in pain scores from baseline represent disease progression and decrease represent clinical response to treatment. VAS will be assessed prior to treatment and then at a followup appointment one to three weeks later.</description>
