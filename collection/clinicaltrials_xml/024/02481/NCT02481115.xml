    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that critical care trained registered nurses and physicians
      can perform measurements of cognitive impairment in critically ill pediatric patients in a
      reliable and valid manner. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will incorporate an
      instrument (psCAM-ICU) to assess both components of consciousness, arousal and content, in
      critically ill pediatric patients at least 6 months to children 5 years of age, both on and
      off mechanical ventilation, and compare these assessments to those of the reference
      standard.

    <measure>Validation of psCAM-ICU</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will validate the psCAM-ICU against a reference standard delirium assessment in critically ill infants and young children. Critical care physicians and registered nurses will use the psCAM-ICU to determine presence or absence of delirium once daily in critically ill infants and young children from 6 months to less than 5 years of age. The reference standard, a pediatric delirium expert (child psychiatrist or equivalent), will independently evaluate the same patients for presence or absence of delirium using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV-TR) as the foundation of assessment.</description>

    <measure>Inter-rater reliability of diagnosing delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess inter-rater reliability between physician, practitioner, and nursing assessment using the psCAM-ICU. The psCAM-ICU should consistently diagnose delirium in the critically ill pediatric patient, independent of the type of medical care provider assessing the patient.</description>

    <measure>Validation of the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Long-term cognitive impairment composite</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical data will be obtained from the medical record to determine a composite measure of long-term cognitive impairment. The composite will include specific outcomes, and follow-up phone interviews with be conducted with a parent/legal guardian at 12 months post-hospital discharge of enrolled patients to assess cognitive function using a validated questionnaire that is compared to expected developmental trajectories based on age adjusted norms.</description>
