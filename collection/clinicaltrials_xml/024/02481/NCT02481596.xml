  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates family-focused mobile phone-delivered intervention, called FAMS
      (Family-focused Add-on for Motivating Self-care), in supporting adults with type 2 diabetes
      in their self-management relative to an individual-focused mobile phone-delivered
      intervention and relative to a control group. The goal of this study is to ascertain if
      family-focused content delivered to the patient can improve the patients' family support for
      diabetes self-care, self-efficacy, and adherence to diet and exercise recommendations
      (compared to an individual mobile phone-delivered intervention and compared to no
      intervention). This study also seeks to assess participants' readiness to invite family
      members to receive intervention content via text messages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family members perform diabetes-specific behaviors that are harmful and/or helpful to the
      adult managing type 2 diabetes. Family behaviors are strongly associated with patients'
      adherence to diet and exercise: supportive family behaviors with more adherence and harmful
      family behaviors with less adherence. This six-month intervention seeks to increase
      supportive and reduce harmful family behaviors, and to improve diabetes-related
      self-efficacy, and adherence to diet and exercise recommendations among adult patients with
      content that can be delivered via basic mobile phones (i.e., phone calls and text messages).

      FAMS components include:

        -  Six 20-30 minute coaching sessions by phone focusing on helpful/unhelpful/desired
           family behaviors relevant to the patients' self-identified daily diet or exercise goal
           (occurs after enrollment and monthly for six months)

        -  Text messages to the patient to support him/her in meeting the identified daily goal (4
           per week)

        -  The option to invite an adult support person to receive text messages (3 per week)
           encouraging the support person to discuss the patient's self-care goal to provide
           opportunities for the patient to practice skills discussed during phone coaching

      This is a supplemental intervention, nested within a larger randomized controlled trial
      (RCT; see NCT02409329) which evaluates REACH, a text messaging intervention to improve
      participants' adherence to self-care and glycemic control. We will evaluate these
      interventions with a three arm trial. Participants will be randomized to intervention or
      control; participants assigned to intervention will be again randomized to receive REACH
      only or REACH+FAMS. Participants assigned to REACH+FAMS will receive the above described
      components for the first six months of the trial, and then REACH only until the end of the
      trail. Analyses will compare change in outcomes at months 3 and 6, respectively, with the
      control group and with the REACH only intervention (NCT02409329).
