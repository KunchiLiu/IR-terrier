      The goal of this research study is to learn what patients and their caregivers think about a
      couple-based Hatha yoga program during treatment for cancer. Researchers also want to learn
      how this program may affect fatigue, distress, sleep quality, and quality of life.

      Some patients and caregivers in this study will take part in a Hatha yoga program together.
      For comparison purposes, there will also be a group of participants that does not take part
      in this program.

      Caregivers:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your demographic information (such as your age,
      sex, and race) will be recorded.

      You and the patient will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.
      This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the
      other group. You and the patient will have about a 50/50 chance of being assigned to each
      group. The first five couples recruited will be assigned to the yoga group. Then subsequent
      groups will be randomly assigned, but your assignment is also based on other factors such as
      your age and the status of the disease.

      Group 1 will take part in the couple-based Hatha yoga program.

      Group 2 will not take part in the couple-based Hatha yoga program but will complete the same
      questionnaires as Group 1. Participants in this group will be given the option to take part
      in the couple-based Hatha yoga program (off study) after they finish their last
      questionnaire packet.

      Group 1 Hatha Yoga Sessions:

      If you are in Group 1, you will take part in up to 15 sessions of Hatha yoga at MD Anderson
      Cancer Center over the course of radiation therapy (up to 5 weekly sessions based on the
      patient's schedule for usually 5-6 weeks). Each 45- to 60-minute session will be guided by
      an instructor. You and the patient should attend each session together.

      During the yoga sessions, you will do deep-breathing exercises and perform different
      stretching and movement exercises. The movements are designed not to be difficult, and you
      will sit on the floor or in a chair while you do them. You can move through the exercises at
      your own pace. The instructor will be available to answer any questions you may have about
      the practice of Hatha yoga.

      Most of the yoga sessions may be videotaped. This is so the researchers can keep track of
      the quality of the sessions. Only the study staff will be able to view the videotapes. The
      video files are digital and will be deleted after all the data are studied.

      At your fifth session, you will be given a CD and instructions for practicing Hatha yoga at
      home. While the patient is receiving radiation therapy, you will be asked to practice at
      home 1 time each day either with him/her or alone on the days you do not have a session at
      the clinic.

      During each week of radiation therapy, you will also complete a questionnaire about the
      Hatha yoga sessions. You will list what you liked or disliked, what you found most and least
      useful, and how you would rate the instructor. You will also be asked about how often you
      practice outside of class and if you think you are benefitting from the Hatha yoga program.
      It should take about 5 minutes to answer this questionnaire. None of your answers to the
      questions on the questionnaires will be shared with the patient.

      Questionnaires for Groups 1 and 2:

      You will complete about 8 questionnaires before or during the patient's first week of
      radiation treatment and again at the end of the treatment schedule (usually 6 weeks later).
      The questionnaires ask about your mood, your quality of life, your feelings about being a
      caregiver, and your relationship. It should take about 45 minutes to complete these
      questionnaires.

      If your questionnaire responses show that you may be having emotional difficulties,
      depression, or risk of harm to yourself and the study staff thinks it is needed, you will be
      contacted by a psychologist at MD Anderson. The same would be done if you show signs of
      emotional distress during a study visit. If the psychologist thinks it is needed, you may be
      seen by a mental health doctor at MD Anderson.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the questionnaires at
      the time of the patient's end of treatment. If he or she stops radiation therapy early, your
      study participation will end at that time.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 40 patients and their caregivers, for a total of up to 80 participants, will be
      enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Patients:

      If you agree to take part in this study, your medical history and demographic information
      (such as your age, sex, and race) will be recorded. Your caregiver will also be approached
      to take part in this study.

      After your first visit, you and your caregiver will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of
      a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better,
      the same, or worse than the other group. You and your caregiver will have about a 50/50
      chance of being assigned to each group. The first five couples recruited will be assigned to
      the yoga group. Then subsequent groups will be randomly assigned, but your assignment is
      also based on other factors such as your age and the status of the disease.

      Group 1 will take part in the couple-based Hatha yoga program.

      Group 2 will not take part in the couple-based Hatha yoga program but will complete the same
      questionnaires as Group 1. Participants in this group will be given the option to take part
      in the couple-based Hatha yoga program (off study) after they finish their last
      questionnaire packet.

      Cancer Center over the course of radiation therapy (up to 5 weekly sessions based on your
      schedule for usually 5-6 weeks). Each 45- to 60-minute session will be guided by an

      It should take about 5 minutes to answer this questionnaire. None of your answers to the
      questions on the questionnaires will be shared with your caregiver.

      Questionnaires for Groups 1 and 2:

      You will complete about 9 questionnaires before or within your first week of radiation
      treatment and again after you complete your treatment schedule (usually 6 weeks later). The
      questionnaires ask about your health, any symptoms you may be having, your mood, your level
      of fatigue, your sleeping habits, your relationship, and your quality of life. It should
      take about 45 minutes to complete these questionnaires.
