  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to test the hypothesis that bezafibrate, a pan-PPAR agonist, may be effective and
      safe for bipolar depression with the following specific aims:

      Aim #1. Proof-of-Concept Safety and Tolerability Aim: To assess the safety and tolerability
      of bezafibrate added to lithium for bipolar depression, especially with regard to worsening
      manic symptoms and suicidal ideation.

      We will conduct a phase IIa, 8-week, open pilot trial of bezafibrate added to lithium in 20
      participants with bipolar depression. We will monitor changes in manic symptoms (Young Mania
      Rating Scale), suicidal ideation, cognitive functioning specifically in attention and verbal
      memory, and treatment emergent adverse events (SAFTEE). We will also monitor changes in the
      Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score.

      Aim #2. Preliminary Assessment of Efficacy: To assess the antidepressant efficacy of
      bezafibrate added to lithium for acute bipolar I major depressive episodes.

      In summary, we propose an 8-week, proof-of-concept open pilot trial of an adjunctive
      pan-PPAR agonist, bezafibrate, for 20 patients with an acute bipolar I major depressive
      episode. The study may have a profound impact on the development of a novel treatment
      consistent with the mitochondrial dysregulation hypothesis of bipolar disorder and, to the
      best of our knowledge, will be the first proof-of-concept trial to assess a pan-PPAR agonist
      for bipolar disorder.
