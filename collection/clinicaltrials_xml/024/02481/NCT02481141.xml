  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of 5-ALA - SFC
      at doses up to 200 mg per day in subjects with type II diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety of 5-ALA - SFC at doses up to 200 mg per day
      in subjects with type II diabetes mellitus. Safety will be assessed by the incidence of
      adverse events and clinically significant laboratory results.

      The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of 5-ALA-SFC at doses up to 200 mg per day
      on glycemic control in subjects with type II diabetes mellitus. Efficacy measures will
      include fasting plasma glucose level, HbA1c level, lipid profile, and body weight.
