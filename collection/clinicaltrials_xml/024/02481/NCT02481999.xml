      Evaluation of mechanisms and factors of anaesthesia on postoperative delirium and emergence
      agitation as well as on postoperative cognitive function in children aged 0,5-8 years
      scheduled for elective surgery. The depth of anesthesia in children for elective surgery
      aged 0,5-6 years is monitored with intraoperative &quot;Narcotrend-Compact-M-Monitoring&quot;.
      Postoperatively the &quot;Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scores (PAED Score)&quot; [Sikich et
      al. 2004] is used to screen for the frequency of postoperative delirium in the post
      anesthesia care unit discharge of the child after surgery. Cognitive testings are performed
      in children of the study group (n= 470) and a control group (n= 80) with the parents support
      to evaluate deficits in children in their cognitive areas (POCD (Postoperative cognitive
      deficit)) at three different time points up to three months.

    <textblock>
      According to recent studies in children aged from 0,5 to 8 years &quot;Narcotrend Monitor&quot; (from
      EEG derived monitoring of the frontal brain waves) can reliably measure the depth of
      anesthesia [Münte et al. 2009; Weber et al. 2005].

      Depth of anesthesia in adults is significantly correlated with the incidence of
      postoperative delirium and longer lasting cognitive deficits [Radtke et al. 2013; Chan et
      al. 2013; Whitlock et al. 2014].

      We know from animal experimental studies that anesthetics have a potential toxic effect in
      the developing brain. [Sinner et al 2014].
