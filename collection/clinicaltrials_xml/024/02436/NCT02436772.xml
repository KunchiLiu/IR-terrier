    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the performance of a blood test for detecting biomarkers in metastatic
      breast cancer patients at one clinic against standard testing.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to detect the expression of FGFR1 and AR on
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from the peripheral blood of metastatic breast
      cancer (MBC) patients using the OncoCEE™ platform. No procedures will be associated with
      this study, as these mutations will be evaluated from the leftover blood that has already
      been sent for standard of care ER and HER2 using the same platform. Results from this
      testing will be correlated with results obtained from standard testing to calculate the rate
      of concordance between tests.
