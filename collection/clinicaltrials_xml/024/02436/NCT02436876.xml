  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and clinical benefit of MBN-101 administered
      intraoperatively to infected osteosynthesis sites for patients diagnosed with a fracture
      site infection associated with orthopaedic hardware. Three quarters of the patients will
      receive MBN-101, while the other one quarter will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative orthopaedic infections, particularly antibiotic-resistant infections, present
      a serious clinical challenge to surgeons and other treating physicians. These infections
      involve implanted foreign materials (stabilizing orthopaedic hardware), making infection of
      these sites much more likely than if foreign materials were not involved. MBN-101 has broad
      spectrum antimicrobial activity against orthopaedic wound pathogens.

      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess the
      safety and tolerability of escalating doses of MBN-101 to treat infected osteosynthesis
      sites during revision surgery with or without hardware removal and replacement for patients
      diagnosed with an apparent fracture site infection within one year of the last surgical
      intervention.
