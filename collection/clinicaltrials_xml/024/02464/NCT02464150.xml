      This study consists of two projects:

        1. 20 participants with celiac disease on a glutenfree diet are asked to consume gluten
           containing muesli bars for 14 days. Endoscopy is done before and after. Questionnaires
           and sampling of blood and feces are done before, during and after.

        2. 66 non celiac gluten sensitive participants on a gluten free diet are asked to consume
           muesli bars containing either gluten, Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides,
           Monosaccharides And Polyols (FODMAP) or placebo daily in one week (three study arms) in
           three consecutive weeks in a random order separated by a wash out period (cross over
           design) in a double-blinded fashion.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Celiac disease confirmed by biopsy or if celiac serology is positive in a subject
             consuming gluten free diet and biopsy is yet not taken but is expected to be
             positive. This does not apply for project 2, here it is sufficient that there is a
             suspicion of non celiac gluten sensitivity and negative diagnostic work up of celiac
             disease.

          -  Age 18 - 80 years

          -  Gluten free diet last 6 months.

          -  Subject has received information and signed the informed consent form

          -  Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody should be tested negative and for project 1 the
             baseline biopsy should not be scored higher than MARSH 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Probability of participant becoming pregnant (f.ex. by not using adequate sexual
             prevention by woman in fertile age)

          -  Drugs influencing immune system used last 3 months

          -  Current infectious disease of moderate or high severity

          -  Other chronic active intestinal disease

          -  Serious reaction on small amounts of gluten ingested

          -  Allergy against sesame seeds, pecan nuts or macadamia nuts

          -  For project 2: Diagnosed Irritable bowel disease (IBS) by ROMA III criteria.
