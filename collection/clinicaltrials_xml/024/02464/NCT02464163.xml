    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant
      hemagglutinin (rHA) influenza vaccine derived from A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) administered at 3
      dose levels in adjuvanted (SE) rHA formulations and 1 dose levels in an unadjuvanted rHA
      formulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All currently licensed influenza vaccines in the United States are produced in embryonated
      hen's eggs. There are several well-recognized disadvantages to the use of eggs as the
      substrate for influenza vaccine. Eggs require specialized manufacturing facilities and could
      be difficult to scale up rapidly in response to an emerging need such as a pandemic. It is
      usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high-yield growth in eggs, a
      process that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and can select receptor
      variants that may have suboptimal immunogenicity. In addition, agricultural diseases that
      affect chicken flocks, and that might be an important issue in a pandemic due to an avian
      influenza virus strain, could easily disrupt the supply of eggs for vaccine manufacturing.
      Therefore, development of alternative substrates for influenza vaccine production has been
      identified as a high-priority objective.

      One potential alternative method for production of influenza vaccine is expression of the
      influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) using recombinant DNA techniques. This alternative avoids
      dependence on eggs and is very efficient because of the high levels of protein expression
      under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.
