  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium, as a common complication of hospitalization, poses significant health problems in
      hospitalized patients. Though about a third of delirium cases can benefit from intervention,
      detecting and predicting delirium is still very limited in practice. A common
      characterization of delirium is changes in activity level, causing patients to become
      hyperactive or hypoactive which is manifested in facial expressions and total body
      movements. This pilot study is designed to test the feasibility of a delirium detection
      system using movement data obtained from 3-axis wearable accelerometers and Microsoft Kinect
      sensor, in conjunction with electronics medical record (EMR) data to analyze the relation of
      whole-body movement as well as facial expressions with delirium.

      The aim of the study is to assess the potential of motion and facial expression data for
      detecting delirium in ICU patients by comparing motion and facial expression patterns in
      delirium and control group. In this study, the investigators will use ActivePalTM
      accelerometer to record each subject's movement patterns. Also, a processed video using the
      KINECT application-programming interface to identify patient facial expressions and movement
      patterns. A total of 40 participants will be enrolled with delirium and 20 patients without
      delirium will be used as control group. Motion profiles will be compared in the motorically
      defined subgroups (hyperactive, hypoactive, normal) based on accelerometer and Kinect data.
      Then differences in facial expression, number of changes in postures and percentage of time
      spent moving between motorically defined subgroups and in delirium and control group. EMR
      data will also be used to assess the feasibility of detecting delirium by additionally
      including information on related risk factors.

    <time_frame>Changes from Baseline up to 7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>DRS-R98 is a 16-item scale with a maximum total scale score of 46 points and a maximum severity score of 39 points.</description>

    <measure>Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) will be used for changes from baseline up to 7 days between the groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from Baseline up to 7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>MDAS denotes motor profile and defines motor subtyping. It has 10 items which assesses several areas of cognitive functioning (memory, attention, orientation and disturbances in thinking) and psychomotor activity. The items are rated on a four point scale (0-3) based on the current interaction with the patient or by assessment of behavior. A score of 13 shows the diagnosis of delirium.</description>

    <measure>Delirium Motor Subtyping Scale (DMSS-4) will be used for changes from baseline up to 7 days between the groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from Baseline up to 7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Scoring from DMSS-4 which has 5 hyperactive and 8 hypoactive symptoms requires at least two symptoms to be present from either the hyperactive or hypoactive list to meet subtype criteria. The higher the score the higher the delirium.</description>
