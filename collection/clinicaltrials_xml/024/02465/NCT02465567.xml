             a negative serum pregnancy test at Visit 1, and agrees to acceptable contraceptive
             methods used consistently and correctly for the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects with an established clinical history of COPD as defined by the American
             Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS),

          -  Current or former smokers with a history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette
             smoking.

          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/Forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio must be
             &lt;0.70 and FEV1 must be &lt;65% predicted normal value calculated using NHANES III
             reference equations (or reference norms applicable to other regions).

          -  Subjects with history of exacerbations.

        Please refer to the study protocol for the complete inclusion criteria list.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Significant diseases or conditions other than COPD, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may put the subject at risk because of participation in the study or
             may influence either the results of the study or the subject's ability to participate
             in the study.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating, or are planning to become pregnant during the
             course of the study, or women of childbearing potential who are not using an

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, have a current diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Subjects who have been hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 3 months
             prior to Visit 1 (Screening)

          -  Subjects who have poorly controlled COPD, defined as acute worsening of COPD that
             requires treatment with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to
             Visit 1 (Screening)

          -  Immune suppression or severe neurological disorders affecting control of the upper
             airway or other risk factors that in the opinion of the Investigator would put the
             subject at substantial risk of pneumonia.

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of narrow angle glaucoma, who, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, have not been adequately treated.

          -  Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to β2-agonists, budesonide or any
             other corticosteroid components, glycopyrronium or other muscarinic anticholinergics,
             or any other component of the IMPs.
