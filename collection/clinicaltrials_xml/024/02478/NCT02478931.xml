  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about personalized cancer therapy including
      response to treatment and side effects. Information about the tests and treatments a person
      received, or will receive, for their cancer will be collected from medical records to help
      the researchers determine whether or not patients respond better when their physicians
      choose to treat them according to the genetic makeup of their tumor. Optional research tests
      may be performed on tissue, body cavity fluid, blood or urine provided, discarded biological
      samples taken during routine care that would normally be disposed of and not saved, or on
      blood samples collected for this study. These research tests will be used to create a
      &quot;profile&quot; of the collected specimens which will describe unique characteristics about the
      genes involved in a person's cancer. The tests will also help researchers look for
      biomarkers that may help predict how people respond to treatment.

      This is a non-therapeutic, correlative study of personalized medicine with retrospective and
      prospective components. Patient medical records will be examined for results of molecular
      profiling obtained through standard of care testing to help understand, in a descriptive
      fashion, how well molecular testing might predict response to therapy. Patient outcome
      parameters including, but not limited to, tumor response, time to treatment failure, patient
      survival, and toxicity will be analyzed, as well as pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic
      (PK) data when available. This study will also include optional research-related testing of
      tissue, blood, or urine specimens via a variety of simple or advanced techniques such as
      molecular, proteomic, and metabolic analyses for biomarker discovery or for PK and PD
      parameters. These specimens will be obtained from clinical specimens archived by UCSD Health
      System Pathology or from specimens collected via an existing IRB-approved protocol,
      discarded specimens, or from specimens collected for this protocol.

    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor molecular profiles will be correlated to treatment outcome, assessed by measures including the response rate, the rate of stable disease (SD)&gt;6months/partial response (PR)/complete response (CR), progression-free survival (PFS), PFS ratio (comparison of the PFS used after molecular profiling to PFS on prior treatment), time to treatment failure, and overall survival. Logistic regression models (univariable and multivariables) will be used when the outcome variable is dichotomous. Kaplan-meier curves will be used for time-to event outcomes, and comparisons will be done with the log-rank test and Cox regression models.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Tumor Biomarker Profiling to Toxicity Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor molecular profiles will be correlated to toxicity rate (serious toxic effects, primarily Grade 3 to 5 toxicity), but may also include less serious chronic toxicity. Toxicity will be assessed using NCI CTCAE, version 4.0.</description>
