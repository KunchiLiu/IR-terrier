  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate any change from baseline in bone mineral density
      (BMD) in subjects following the switch from a triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen
      containing Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NRTI) - sparing two - drug regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) + rilpivirine (RPV) in
      subjects participating in the parent studies 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2).

      This open-label, parallel group, study is a sub-study which will recruit subjects who are
      receiving ART regimens which include TDF at the time of randomization to receive treatment
      in one of two identical parent studies 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2). These are
      Phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, non-inferiority studies
      evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching to DTG plus RPV from current
      integrase inhibitor (INI)-, non NNRTI-, or protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral
      regimen in HIV-1-infected adults who are virologically suppressed, having HIV-1 ribonucleic
      acid (RNA) levels &lt;50 copies per millilitre (c/mL). Randomisation in the parent studies will
      be stratified by baseline third agent class (INI, NNRTI, or PI), age group (&lt; or =&gt;50 years
      old) and participation in this Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) sub-study, therefore
      there will also be balance across the treatment arms in this sub-study both overall and with
      respect to baseline third agent class and age at entry.

      The study population will include approximately 75 evaluable subjects recruited from the
      Early Switch DTG + RPV treatment group of the parent studies 201636 and 201637, and
      approximately 75 evaluable subjects from the Late Switch group who continue their current
      antiretroviral therapy (CAR) through to Week 52 across both the 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1
      and SWORD-2) studies. Subjects participating in study 202094 will have DEXA scans performed
      at Day 1 and at study Weeks 48, 100 and 148 in parallel with the corresponding scheduled
      visits in the parent studies.
