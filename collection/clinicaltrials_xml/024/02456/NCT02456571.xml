    <textblock>
      This pilot study will explore the prevalence of expression of four immune checkpoint
      biomarkers on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from men with metastatic prostate cancer that
      are captured by EpCAM via the CellSearch method, and specifically defined as co expressing
      DAPI and cytokeratin, and lacking CD45 expression.

          3. Age &gt; 18 years.

          4. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        In addition to meeting all of the above criteria, patients must meet all of the criteria
        for one of the following groups:
