      All patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) will be treated with GnRH antagonist
      protocol. Recombinant Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) will be given on day 2 or day 3 of
      menstrual cycle for 5 days. The starting dose is individualized for each patient based on
      the following criteria: Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) &lt; 0.7 ng/ml, dose 300 IU/day, AMH 0.7
      -2.1 ng/ml, dose 225 IU/day, AMH &gt; 2.1 ng/ml, dose 150 IU/day. After that, investigators can
      titrate the dose based on their clinical judgment. Follicular development will be monitored
      by ultrasound scanning and measurement of estradiol, progesterone starting on day 5 of
      stimulation. Scanning and hormonal measurement will be repeated every 2 to 3 days, depending
      on the size of follicles. Antagonist is routinely used on day 5 until the day of Human
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Criteria for recombinant hCG (5,000IU or 10,000IU)
      administration is the presence of at least three leading follicles of 17 mm. Oocyte
      retrieval is performed 36 hours after recombinant hCG administration.

      Insemination will be performed by using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, 3 - 4 hours after
      oocyte retrieval. Only matured oocytes are inseminated. Fertilization are performed under
      inverted microscope at period of 16-18 hours after insemination.

      On day 3, embryo evaluation will be performed at fixed time point 68±1 hours after
      fertilization, using Istanbul consensus. After grading embryo, eligible patients will be
      invited to participate in the study. Written consent will be obtained from each patient for
      participation into the study. Patients were randomized into 2 groups fresh embryo transfer
      and freeze-all. Eligible subjects will be randomized in blocks of 4 via a computer generated
      random number list to either the freeze all group or the fresh embryo transfer (ET) group.

      Freeze all group

      All grade 1 and grade 2 embryos were cryopreserved using vitrification method. In the next
      cycle, endometrium will be prepared by using estradiol orally, starting from day 2-3 of
      menstrual cycle. When endometrium thickness reaches 8mm or more, patients start to use
      progesterone vaginally. Embryo transfer is performed 3 days after using progesterone. On the
      day of embryo transfer, embryos will be thawed. Two hours after thawing, surviving embryos
      will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound guidance. Luteal-phase support is done
      with estradiol 8mg/day and vaginal progesterone 800mg/day until 7th week of gestation.

      Fresh ET group

      In fresh ET group, maximum 2 embryos will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound
      guidance. Luteal-phase support will be continued up to 7th week of gestation either therapy
      was provide using estradiol and exogenous progesterone supplementation or hCG with exogenous
      progesterone combination.

      In both of groups, serum hCG was measured 2 weeks after embryo transferred, and if positive,
      an ultrasound scan of the uterus was performed at gestational weeks 7 and 12.

      METHODS

      STUDY ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint Ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR). Ongoing pregnancy is
      explained as a pregnancy with positive heart beat beyond 12 weeks of gestation.

      Secondary endpoints Clinical pregnancy rate. Clinical pregnancy is explained as the presence
      of a gestational sac seen by transvaginal sonography 7 weeks after embryo placement.

      Implantation rate is explained as the number of gestational sacs per number of embryos
      transferred.

      Multiple pregnancy rate. Multiple pregnancy is explained as two or more fetal heart rates by
      transvaginal sonography 7 weeks after embryo placement.

      RANDOMIZATION Randomization will be performed on day 3, using a blocks of 4 via a computer
      generated random number list. Patients will be allocated to either the freeze all group or
      the fresh ET group.

      STUDY PROCEDURES Patients will be treated according to local protocol.

      SUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT A review of patient information should be done prior to enrolment
      to determine preliminary eligibility according to patient inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      When a patient signs an informed consent she is considered to be enrolled in the study.

      WITHDRAWAL OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS Patients can leave the study at any time for any reason if
      they wish to do so without any consequences for their treatment. The investigator can decide
      to withdraw a subject from the study or urgent medical reasons.

      SAFETY REPORTING

      The investigator will inform the subjects and the reviewing accredited medical research
      ethics committee; if anything occurs, on the basis of which it appears that the
      disadvantages of participation may be significantly greater than was foreseen in the
      research proposal. The study will be suspended pending further review by the accredited
      medical research ethics committee, except insofar as suspension would jeopardize the
      subjects' health. The investigator will take care that all subjects are kept informed.

      ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS All observed or volunteered adverse events, regardless of
      treatment group or suspected causal relationship to intervention, will be recorded. Adverse
      events are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a clinical
      trial, whether or not considered related to the intervention. All adverse events reported
      spontaneously by the subject or observed by the investigator or his staffs will be recorded.

      A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose
      results in death;

        -  is life threatening (at the time of the event);

        -  requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalisation;

        -  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;

        -  is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;

        -  is a new event of the trial likely to affect the safety of the subjects, such as an
           unexpected outcome of an adverse reaction.

      All adverse events will be followed until they have abated, or until a stable situation has
      been reached. Depending on the event, follow up may require additional tests or medical
      procedures as indicated, and/or referral to the general physician or a medical specialist.

      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

      RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT The investigator must explain to each subject the nature of this
      study, its purpose, procedures, expected duration and the potential risks and benefits
      involved in study participation along with any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must
      be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that withdrawal of consent will
      not affect her right to the most appropriate medical treatment or affect the doctor
      relationship.

      This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement. It should be
      written so as to be easily understood by the subject. The subject should be given the time
      to read and understand the statement herself before signing her consent and dating the
      document. The subject should receive a copy of the written statement once signed.

      PRIVACY ASPECTS Participating subjects will be registered by a 5-digit number. This personal
      code will be on all forms retrieved from participants.

      BENEFITS AND RISKS ASSESSMENT, GROUP RELATEDNESS There is insufficient evidence for a
      rational policy in between the 2 strategies, freeze all or fresh ET. The potential benefits
      of freeze all are higher pregnancy rate, with a lower incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation
      syndrome (OHSS) and/or ectopic pregnancy. The potential harm would be time-consuming.
