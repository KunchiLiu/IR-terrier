    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria (patients must):

          1. Be scheduled for ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation due to the arrhythmia
             being recurrent, poorly tolerated and/or unable to be controlled with at least one
             antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Persistent atrial fibrillation in this study is defined
             as the following:

               1. AF lasting at least 7 days but no more than 12 months without cardioversion

                  Or

               2. AF lasting at least 48 hours but no more than 12 months prior to cardioversion
                  to terminate AF

          2. Be able and willing to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria (patients must not):

          1. Have a history of AF longer than 12 months

          2. Have any of the following:

               1. Patients with implanted prosthetic, artificial, or repaired cardiac valves in
                  the chamber being mapped

               2. Patients with implanted pacemaker or ICD

               3. Patients with history of embolism or an inability to tolerate anticoagulation
                  therapy during and after an electrophysiology procedure

               4. Stents in the area of the pulmonary veins

          3. Have a contraindication for transfemoral venous access or any other element of an AF
             ablation procedure

          4. Have a contraindication for transseptal left atrial access including atrial septal
             occluder device

          5. Have a left atrial appendage occlusion device

          6. Have had prior ablation for atrial fibrillation

          7. NYHA class IV congestive heart failure

          8. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40%

          9. Have or have had rheumatic mitral valve disease

         10. Have a left atrial diameter of &gt;55 mm (any dimension)

         11. Have had a myocardial infarction within the prior three months

         12. Have had any atrial surgery (including valve repair/replacement) in the right or left
             atrium

         13. Have an intracardiac thrombus (must be confirmed via ultrasound prior to mapping) or
             dense spontaneous echo contrast

         14. Have clinically significant severe tricuspid and/or mitral valve regurgitation or
             moderate or severe tricuspid and/or mitral valve stenosis

         15. Have had any prior stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or systemic embolism

         16. Be pregnant or nursing

         17. Have a life expectancy of less than one year

         18. Be currently enrolled in any other clinical treatment study
