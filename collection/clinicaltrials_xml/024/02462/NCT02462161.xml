  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial will examine the effects of intranasal insulin aspart on
      cognition, daily function, blood and CSF markers of Alzheimer's disease, and amyloid
      deposition in the brain. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive insulin aspart or
      placebo during a 12-week treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence suggests that insulin plays a role in normal memory processes and
      that insulin abnormalities may contribute to cognitive and brain changes associated with
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly, insulin administered to the nasal cavity is
      transported within a few minutes into the brain, but does not affect blood sugar or insulin
      levels.

      This trial will consist of a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group
      trial in which 30 participants with AD or MCI receive twice daily intranasal administrations
      of insulin aspart (20 IU bid) or placebo (saline bid) for 12 weeks. All participants will
      appoint a &quot;support person&quot; to answer a collateral questionnaire and supervise the
      administration of the study drug. All participants and study partners will undergo the
      intensive, structured training program in the self-management of intranasal insulin
      administration. Cognitive testing and blood collection will occur at baseline, after 6 weeks
      of treatment, and at the end of the 12 week treatment period. Participants will also receive
      a lumbar puncture to measure AD biomarkers in the subject's cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).
