      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, single arm study to
      characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) profile of Ferric
      Carboxymaltose dosing in pediatric subjects with IDA after receiving either a 7.5 mg/kg or
      15 mg/kg dose of Ferric Carboxymaltose.
