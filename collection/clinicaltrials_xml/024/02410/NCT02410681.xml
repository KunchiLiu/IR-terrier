  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive mechanical forces can cause complications of dental implants and their
      suprastructures (crowns and bridges), and can possibly be destructive for the bone and soft
      tissues around the implants. Sleep bruxism (grinding and clenching of the teeth during
      sleep) is considered as an important source of mechanical forces in the oral environment.
      Therefore, in this study, the investigators will investigate whether sleep bruxism is
      associated with implant and peri-implant complications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Planned for treatment with implant-supported fixed suprastructure(s).

          -  18 years of age or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Opposing teeth of implant-supported fixed suprastructure(s) are restored with
             removable artificial teeth.

          -  Patients categorized in the classes 3 or higher according to the ASA system for
             classification of physical status.

          -  Use of occlusal splint, mandibular repositioning appliance or any other bruxism
             mitigating device during sleep.

          -  Active periodontitis at the time of implant placement.

          -  Known allergy to Grindcare® electrode material.
