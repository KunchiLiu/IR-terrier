    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility of a three-parallel-arm, placebo-controlled randomized trial
      using a standard auricular acupressure protocol for managing nausea and vomiting in a
      homogenous group of female breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      The null hypotheses of this study are: (1) There will be no significant difference in the
      occurrence, frequency and severity of acute/delayed nausea and vomiting among groups during
      the intervention period; (2) There will be no significant difference in the occurrence,
      frequency and severity of anticipatory nausea and vomiting among groups before the second
      cycle of chemotherapy; (3) There will be no significant difference in quality of life status
      among groups at the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy.

      Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the most common and distressing
      side-effects among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Despite steady progresses in
      antiemetic prophylaxis and treatment during the past decades, approximately half of cancer
      patients receiving moderately to highly emetogenic chemotherapy still experience significant
      nausea and vomiting. Considering the facts that CINV is difficult to be completely
      controlled by antiemetics along, healthcare professionals has explored the role of
      non-pharmacological interventions as adjunctive therapy for controlling CINV. Among which,
      auricular therapy (AT) is a promising approach but the evidence has still not been
      concluded.

      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial using
      auricular acupressure for managing nausea and vomiting in female breast cancer patients
      undergoing chemotherapy. The objectives of this study will be: (1) to pilot the
      methodological procedures of the randomized controlled trial using a standard auricular
      acupressure protocol for controlling CINV; (2) to determine the recruitment rate and the
      attrition rate during the whole study periods; (3) to examine the effects of auricular
      acupressure on the occurrence, frequency and severity of CINV as well as the QoL status in
      female breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy; (4) to identify potential adverse
      events associated with auricular acupressure; (5) to explore patients' experiences and
      burdens on completing the trial and the reasons for study attrition; and (6) to refine the
      study protocol for a future multicenter, large-scale randomized controlled trial.

      A three-parallel-arm, placebo-controlled randomized pilot and feasibility study will be
      adopted. One hundred and fourteen breast cancer patients scheduled to receive the first
      cycle of chemotherapy will be recruited from three provincial hospitals in Fuzhou, China,
      and will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups: the true AT group, the sham AT
      group or the standard care group. Participants in the true AT group will receive standard
      anti-emetic medications plus a 5-day auricular acupressure at the specific ear acupoints,
      and participants in the sham AT group will receive standard anti-emetic medications plus a
      5-day auricular acupressure at the same acupoints as in the true AT group but no pressure
      will be applied, while participants in the standard care group will only be provided with
      the standard anti-emetic medications. The feasibility outcomes will be the recruitment rate
      and consent rate during the recruitment stage, and the attrition rate during the study
      periods. The future main study outcomes will also be measured including the occurrence,
      frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting, quality of life (QoL) status and potential
      adverse events associated with AT. After completing the pilot clinical trial, a nested
      qualitative interview will be conducted to explore participants' experiences and burdens on
      completing the trial and the reasons for study attrition.
