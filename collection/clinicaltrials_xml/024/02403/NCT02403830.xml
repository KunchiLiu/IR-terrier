  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is associated with more prompt and potent antiplatelet effects compared with
      clopidogrel, leading to better clinical outcomes, including reduced cardiovascular
      mortality, across the spectrum of patients with acute coronary syndrome, including those
      with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI). However, in this latter setting a delay in the onset of its antiplatelet
      effects has been shown. Morphine has been identified as a cause of delayed P2Y12 inhibition
      in patients with STEMI. Methylnaltrexone is a parenteral peripheral opioid receptor
      antagonist which has the potential to prevent or reverse opioid-induced peripherally
      mediated side effects without affecting analgesia. However, whether the use of intravenous
      methylnaltrexone may overcome the effects of morphine administration on the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles of ticagrelor has not been investigated yet. The
      proposed investigation will include patients with coronary artery disease and will have a
      prospective, randomized, cross-over design.

      Ticagrelor is associated with more prompt and potent antiplatelet effects compared with
      clopidogrel, leading to better clinical outcomes, including reduced cardiovascular
      mortality, across the spectrum of patients with acute coronary syndrome, including those
      with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI). However, in this latter setting a delay in the onset of its antiplatelet
      effects has been shown. Morphine has been identified as a cause of delayed P2Y12 inhibition
      in patients with STEMI. In fact, opiates are known to inhibit gastric emptying, leading to
      delayed absorption and potentially decreasing peak plasma levels of orally administered
      drugs. Methylnaltrexone is a parenteral peripheral opioid receptor antagonist which has the
      potential to prevent or reverse opioid-induced peripherally mediated side effects (i.e.
      gastric emptying inhibition) without affecting analgesia. Studies have shown that
      methylnaltrexone effectively prevented morphine-induced gut motility change. However,
      whether the use of intravenous methylnaltrexone may overcome the effects of morphine
      administration on the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles of ticagrelor
      has not been investigated yet. The proposed investigation will include patients with
      coronary artery disease and will have a prospective, randomized, cross-over design. Patients
      will be randomized to receive either intravenous methylnaltrexone or placebo. Immediately
      after methylnaltrexone administration, patients will receive intravenous morphine and then
      will receive a 180-mg ticagrelor loading dose 15 minutes after morphine administration.
      After a 7 Â± 2 days wash-out period, patients will cross-over to the alternate
      study-treatment arm. At each visit, blood samples for PK and PD assessments will be
      collected at several time points. This study will provide insights on a possible treatment
      strategy to overcome the impaired P2Y12 inhibition induced by morphine.

    <description>Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to receive either i.v methylnaltrexone or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride iv injection). Methylnaltrexone, at a dose of 0.3 mg/Kg, will be administered diluted with 5 ml of normal saline as a single i.v. bolus over 1 minute followed by morphine (5-mg intravenous bolus). Then patients will receive iv morphine and a loading dose of ticagrelor.</description>
