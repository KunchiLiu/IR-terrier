  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose/aim of this study is to assess 1) the long-term persistence (4 to 7.5 years
      after the last dose) of bactericidal activity following primary vaccination with rMenB+OMV
      NZ in adolescents [who previously participated in parent studies V72_41 (NCT0142384) and
      V72P10 (NCT00661713)] and 2) the kinetics of immune response following booster vaccination
      with rMenB+OMV NZ

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After all subjects (Groups A and B) from Canada and Australia have completed the study, an
      interim analysis for the primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives will be performed.
      Follow on subjects (Group A) from parent study V72_41 (NCT0142384) will be analyzed for i)
      antibody persistence at approximately 4 years following a 2 dose primary series and ii) the
      immune response at 3, 7 and 30 days after a third dose (booster) of rMenB+OMV NZ. Canadian
      and Australian vaccine naïve subjects (Group B) will be analyzed for the immune response at
      30 days after the first dose, and 3, 7 and 30 days after the second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ.

      Subjects in Group B (naïve subjects) will be randomized into two different blood draw
      schedules according to a 1:1 ratio.
