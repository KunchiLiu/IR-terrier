  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-sequence, two-period crossover study,
      separated by 7 days washout interval from the first study drug administration.

      In this study, the bioavailability of Rabeprazole from Idiazole 20 milligram (mg) delayed
      release (DR) tablets and PARIET 20 mg DR tablets after a single oral dose administration of
      each to healthy adults under fasting conditions, will be investigated by determining the 90%
      confidence limits for the log-transformed ratio (Test product / Reference product) for the
      bioequivalence parameters. The influence of sequence, product and period effect will be
      tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA).

      In this study a total of 60 subjects plus 1-4 additional subjects will be enrolled and split
      into two groups (Group A and B) of 30 each. For each subject, a total of 33 blood draws will
      be done and the volume of blood will not exceed 300 milliliters (mL) for the study.

    <time_frame>Day 1 (Up to 14 hours post dose) in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>K¬e will be calculated from a semi-log plot of the plasma concentration versus time curve. The parameter will be calculated by linear least-squares regression analysis using the last three (or more) non-zero plasma concentrations.</description>
