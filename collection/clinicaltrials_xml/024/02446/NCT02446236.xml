  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation to determine the MTD and/or RPII for combinations of ibrutinib
      (PCI-32765) plus lenalidomide/rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell
      lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a relatively rare subtype (3% to 6% (Zhou, 2008) of mature B
      cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), with a median age at diagnosis in mid to late 60's, a male
      predominance (3/1) and typically advanced stage presentation though only about 1/3 of
      patients are truly symptomatic at baseline (Armitage, 1998). Although significant
      controversies remain in the management of MCL, all would agree that the challenges
      associated with MCL, particularly the poor results with standard chemotherapy and frequent
      chemoresistance have pushed the community to be more innovative and active in clinical
      research. Hence the median OS has clearly improved over the last 3 decades (from 2-3y to
      &gt;5y) (Goy, 2011a), thanks to deeper responses obtained with intensive regimens in younger
      patients (an early CR translates into clearly better outcome) and also better salvage
      therapies with now MCL being the only lymphoma with 4 new biologicals approved (3 in the US
      and 1 in EU).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of MCL.

          -  Relapsed or refractory MCL patients who have received at least one prior therapy are
             eligible. Patients who have previously received high-dose chemotherapy with
             peripheral stem cell support are eligible.

          -  Presence of at least one lymph node evaluable or mass measurable for response.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status greater than 2.

             of study registration (unless the treating physician deems the neutropenia is related
             to bone marrow involvement, then an ANC of &gt; 750/mm 3 is allowed)
