      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefits of SYSTANE® ULTRA Lubricant
      Eye Drops using total ocular surface staining scores in subjects with dry eye administering
      it either as a scheduled regimen or as-needed after 28 days of treatment. This study will be
      conducted in the US and in Australia.

      This study will consist of a 14-day Run-in Phase (between the Screening Visit and
      Baseline/Visit 1) and a Treatment Phase. During the Run-in Phase, subjects will discontinue
      current artificial tears and be dispensed SYSTANE® ULTRA to be administered 1 drop in each
      eye as needed (PRN). Subjects who meet the re-evaluation criteria after the Run-in Phase
      will be randomized in a 1:2 manner to receive treatment with SYSTANE® ULTRA 4 times per day
      (QID) or PRN, respectively, for 28 days.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Total Ocular Surface Staining (TOSS) score at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The TOSS score is a cumulative cornea and conjunctival staining score. After instilling ophthalmic dye in the eye, the investigator grades three areas of the ocular surface for dryness on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is &quot;Absent&quot; and 5 is &quot;Severe.&quot; The three scores are summed for a resultant overall 0-15 score.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Impact of Dry Eye on Everyday Life Symptom-Bother (IDEEL SB) score at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The IDEEL SB module is a 20 question patient reported outcome questionnaire that assesses the subject's symptoms of dry eye. An overall resultant calculated score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater symptom bother.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Impact of Dry Eye on Everyday Life Treatment Satisfaction (IDEEL TS) scores (treatment effectiveness and treatment-related inconvenience) at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The IDEEL is 10-question patient-reported outcome questionnaire that assesses the subject's general satisfaction with treatment use. A resultant overall 0-100 treatment satisfaction score is calculated, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction and less treatment-related bother.</description>
