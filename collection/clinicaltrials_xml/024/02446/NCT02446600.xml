      This randomized phase III trial studies olaparib or cediranib maleate and olaparib to see
      how well they work compared with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in treating patients
      with platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come
      back. Olaparib and cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer by blocking the growth of new blood vessels
      necessary for tumor growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, paclitaxel,
      gemcitabine hydrochloride, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether olaparib
      or cediranib maleate and olaparib is more effective than standard platinum-based
      chemotherapy in treating patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube, or
      primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy of either single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib
      (cediranib maleate) and olaparib, as measured by progression free survival (PFS), as
      compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent
      platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy of single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib and
      olaparib, as measured by response rate and overall survival as compared to standard
      platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary
      peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      II. Assess the efficacy of single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib and
      olaparib, as measured by PFS, in women with or without deleterious germline breast cancer
      (BRCA) mutations (gBRCAmt) in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      III. Assess the effect on disease-related symptoms (DRS) as measured by the 9-item DRS-P
      subscale of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy (NCCN-FACT) Ovarian Symptom Index-18 (NFOSI-18), of single agent olaparib or
      cediranib and olaparib, compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy, in the setting of
      recurrent platinum sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      IV. Assess the efficacy of single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib and
      olaparib, as measured by PFS, in women with or without homologous repair deficiencies as
      measured by BROCA in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      V. To assess changes in the number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) following three
      days of treatment with olaparib, combination olaparib/cediranib, or standard platinum-based
      chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer.

      VI. To assess whether change in the number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) following
      three days of treatment with olaparib, combination olaparib/cediranib, or standard
      platinum-based chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer is prognostic for PFS.

      VII. To develop a profile from a panel of angiogenic biomarkers in women with recurrent
      platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer which is associated
      with PFS, and then validate the predictive value of this biomarker profile.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the time from randomization to the first non-study, anti-cancer therapy,
      surgery or death (TFST) for single-agent olaparib or combination cediranib and olaparib
      relative to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent
      platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      II. To assess the time from randomization to the second non-study, anti-cancer therapy,
      surgery or death (TSST) for single-agent olaparib or combination cediranib and olaparib
      relative to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent
      platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      III. Assess the effect on secondary measures of quality of life, as assessed by the
      treatment side effects (TSE) and function / well-being (F/WB) subscales of the NFOSI-18,
      sensory neuropathy as measured by the FACT/GOG-Ntx-4, and health utility as measured by the
      Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), of single agent olaparib or cediranib and
      olaparib, compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy, in the setting of recurrent
      platinum sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients may be treated with one of the three regimens per investigator discretion.

      REGIMEN I: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REGIMEN II: Patients receive carboplatin IV on day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 for at least 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REGIMEN III: Patients receive carboplatin IV and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive olaparib PO BID and cediranib maleate PO once daily (QD). Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

             this study; screening imaging to rule out brain metastases is not required for
             screening, but should be performed prior to study enrollment if clinically indicated;
             patients with treated brain metastases and resolution of any associated symptoms must
             demonstrate stable post-therapeutic imaging for at least 6 months following therapy
