  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blinded placebo-controlled non-inferiority study will examine the incidence and
      significance of contrast-induced acute kidney injury following intravenous iodinated
      contrast material administration in subjects with stage IIIB or stage IV chronic kidney
      disease.

      Subjects will be scheduled for clinically indicated CT of the abdomen and/or pelvis to
      evaluate for suspected intra-abdominal infection. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      either weight-based low-osmolality iodinated contrast material or saline. The primary
      outcome measure will be the incidence of stage II AKI by AKIN criteria.

      outcome measure will be the incidence of stage II AKI by AKIN criteria. Secondary outcome
      measures will include AKI by other definitions (stage I AKI, traditional CI-AKI definition),
      hospital length of stay, 30-day readmission rate, number of additional percutaneous
      interventions within 30 days, number of additional CT examinations within 30 days, and
      30-day mortality rate. All subjects will receive a minimum of 1 mL/kg/hr (max: 125 mL/hr) of
      volume expansion for at least three hours pre and three hours post-CT.
