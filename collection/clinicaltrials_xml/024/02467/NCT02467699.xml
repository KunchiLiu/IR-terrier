  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The knee prosthesis is a validated treatment for end-stage osteoarthritis, and this
      intervention usually provides a significant improvement in the quality of life of patients.
      However, a significant percentage of patients (up 30%) say disappointed with the outcome of
      the intervention. One hypothesis that could explain these poor results might be poor
      adaptation of the implants to the patient's anatomy, resulting in a non-physiological
      kinematics for the patient. Multiple studies try to obtain an individual adaptation of the
      intervention according to multiple criteria. The measurement of the kinematics of the knee
      before surgery could participate in this process.
