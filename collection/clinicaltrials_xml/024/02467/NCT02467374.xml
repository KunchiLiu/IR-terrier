  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about how the brain stores emotional learning
      in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In particular, we would like to understand how human
      beings learn not to fear. We are also interested in learning about how behavioral therapy
      (BT) for OCD affects emotional learning in the brain. We hope this study will help us
      understand why people with OCD cannot control unwanted fear and to develop better treatments
      for adults with OCD. Patients will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive
      12 weeks of BT or 12 weeks of waitlist, followed by 12 weeks of BT. We are seeking
      right-handed individuals 18-60 with OCD and individuals with no psychiatric history.
      Participation includes a diagnostic evaluation, 12 weeks of BT or 12 weeks of waitlist
      followed by BT, questionnaires, and up to six (6) MRI scans. You may receive up to $500 for
      your participation and reimbursement for parking.

    <description>If assigned to the immediate BT condition, patients will be asked to make about 24 visits to our clinics at MGH, including an initial assessment, 12 therapy visits over 12 weeks, and 1 booster session (Week 16). Patients will be asked to come to the clinic for assessments during weeks 4 and 6 and after the treatment (week 12), as well as 1 follow-up visit (week 24). Additionally, patients will participate in 6 MRI scanning sessions at the Charlestown Navy Yard.</description>

In this case, they will be asked to make about 21 visits to our clinics, including an initial assessment visit, 12 therapy visits, and 1 booster session.

    <description>BT for OCD focuses primarily on &quot;exposure with response prevention (ERP).&quot; &quot;ERP&quot; involves gradual exposure to anxiety-provoking situations (things or situations that frighten or disturb some people), and will help to prevent compulsions (repetitive behaviors).</description>
