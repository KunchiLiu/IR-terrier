  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether topical ocular administration of LME636 60
      mg/mL is efficacious in resolving the ocular inflammation in the anterior chamber associated
      (AC) with acute anterior uveitis (AAU).

    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to LME636 or Dexamethasone in a 3:1 ratio at the time
      they present to the trial site with the AAU flare and will enter treatment for 28 full days.
      Subjects with worsening disease from Visit 2/Day 4 onward or subjects without improvement
      after 14 days of treatment will be discontinued from treatment, unmasked and treated with a
      rescue regimen at the discretion of the investigator.
