      The purpose of this study is to determine whether applying testosterone to virtual
      reality-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for premenopausal women with social anxiety
      disorder improves treatment outcomes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients between the ages of 18 to 70 years of age with a primary psychiatric
             diagnosis (designated by the patient as the most important source of current
             distress) of social anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-5 criteria, with fear of
             public speaking endorsed as a primary concern.

          -  Willingness and ability to participate in the informed consent process and comply
             with the requirements of the study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current use of testosterone enhancing products (i.e., gels, creams, or injections)

          -  A lifetime history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, or delusional
             disorders; organic brain syndrome, mental retardation or other cognitive dysfunction
             that could interfere with capacity to engage in therapy; a history of substance or
             alcohol abuse or dependence (other than nicotine) in the last 6 months.

          -  Entry of patients with other mood or anxiety disorders will be permitted in order to
             increase accrual of a clinically relevant sample; however in cases where SAD is not
             judged to be the predominant disorder, participants will not be eligible.

          -  Patients with significant suicidal ideation or who have enacted suicidal behaviors
             within 6 months prior to intake will be excluded from study participation and
             referred for appropriate clinical intervention.

          -  Patients using psychotropic medication (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics, beta
             blockers) must be on a stable dose for three weeks prior to initiation of randomized
             treatment.

          -  Significant personality dysfunction likely to interfere with study participation.

          -  Patients with a current or past history of seizures.

          -  Any concurrent psychotherapy initiated within 3 months of baseline, or ongoing
             psychotherapy of any duration directed specifically toward treatment of the SAD is
             excluded. Prohibited psychotherapy includes CBT or psychodynamic therapy focusing on
             exploring specific, dynamic causes of the phobic symptomatology and providing
             management skills. General supportive therapy initiated &gt; 3 months prior is
             acceptable.

          -  Prior non-response to adequately delivered exposure (i.e., as defined by the
             patient's report of receiving specific and regular exposure assignments as part of a
             previous treatment).

          -  Patients with a history of head trauma causing loss of consciousness, seizure or
             ongoing cognitive impairment.

          -  Subjects with back pain issues or medical conditions that would make it difficult to
             hold posture manipulations.

          -  Insufficient command of the English language.
