      This study is primarily looking to see if it is feasible to assess frailty in patients with
      advanced hepatocellular cancer. It is also evaluating whether there may be any correlation
      between these assessments and toxicity of treatment and outcome.

      The assessments include: Frailty score, nutritional assessment, comorbidity score and
      quality of life. In addition sarcopenia will be assessed measuring muscle mass from imaging
      performed as part of routine clinical care.

      The assessments will be performed at baseline on entry into the study, at week 9 and week
      18.

      There is the option for patients to also donate a blood samples for research purposes.
