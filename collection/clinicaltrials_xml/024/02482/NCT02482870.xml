    <textblock>
      The investigators studied the correlation between the Mallampati classification and the
      Cormack-Lehane grades obtained with Macintosh and the King Vision video laryngoscopy in
      adult patients scheduled for general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Securing the airway is essential in general anesthesia. Anesthetic problems related to
      airway management constitute 17% of closed claims, difficult intubation being the most
      common one with an occurrence rate of 5%. Problems like delayed intubation, misplaced
      tracheal tube, or airway trauma are frequently seen in outpatient settings and end up with
      either death or hypoxic brain damage. Therefore, preoperative visit should include detailed
      assessment of the airways according to clues of difficult intubation.Several studies
      compared the King Vision video laryngoscope with other laryngoscopes in manikins simulating
      difficult airway scenarios, and reported better glottic views. The investigators aimed to
      study the correlation between the Mallampati classification and the glottic views
      (Cormack-Lehane grade) obtained with Macintosh laryngoscopy, and the King Vision video
      laryngoscopy in adult patients scheduled for general anesthesia. Secondary outcomes will be
      successful intubation rate, time to obtain the best view, time to successful intubation, and
      complications related to laryngoscopy will be compared.
