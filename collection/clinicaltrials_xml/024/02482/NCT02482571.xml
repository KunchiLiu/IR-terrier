  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to measure neurochemicals in the activated human
      brain during both normoxia (normal oxygen availability) and induced mild hypoxia (reduced
      oxygen availability).

      The goal is to determine the effect of mild hypoxia on human brain energy metabolism of
      healthy young adult subjects. For this purpose, the Investigator will utilize non-invasive
      imaging modalities based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and spectroscopy
      (fMRS), while subjects are exposed to well-controlled gas mixtures that resembles conditions
      of either normoxia or mild hypoxia. Identifying the impact of mild hypoxia on functional
      brain energy metabolism in the healthy human brain is a crucial step for generating
      hypotheses in multiple patient populations that experience mild hypoxia as consequence of
      their pathological condition, such as in sleep apnea and traumatic brain injury. The
      Investigator hypothesize that the energetic demands of neuronal activation as revealed by
      fMRS will not be affected by mild hypoxia, despite an altered hemodynamic response observed
      with fMRI.

    <description>Subjects are exposed to an intervention that controls the composition of breathed air by using a gas blender (RespirAct). Subjects undergo MRI and MRS while breathing air with both normal oxygen concentration (normoxia) and reduced oxygen concentration (mild hypoxia).</description>

    <description>During normoxia, the computer-controlled gas blender provides a gas mixture that generates pressures of expired O2 and CO2 similar to the resting values measured for each subject (32-35mmHg and 100-110 mmHg, respectively). During mild hypoxia, we will target the same expired CO2 of normoxia and a 60 mmHg reduction of expired O2 from the resting value (to a minimum limit of 50 mmHg), which is expected to reduce arterial oxygen saturation to 82-85%. In mild hypoxia, the fraction of inspired oxygen is reduced from ~21% (room air) to ~12% (equivalent to an altitude of 4000 meters). During both conditions of normoxia and mild hypoxia, the brain activity of subjects is monitored with functional magnetic MRI (fMRI) and spectroscopy (fMRS) while they are presented with visual stimuli.</description>
