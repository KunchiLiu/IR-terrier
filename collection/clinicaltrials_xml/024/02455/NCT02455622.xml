      This long-term study will provide Elaprase treatment to children enrolled in this study and
      will utilize data from both enrolled patients and Hunter Outcome Survey (HOS) patient
      registry data to conduct the primary growth analysis to assess changes in height and weight
      in patients with Mucopolysaccharidosis II (Hunter syndrome) MPS II.

               1. The patient is male.

               2. The patient is Elaprase-naïve at study entry.

               3. The patient must have a documented diagnosis of MPS II. Of the 3 criteria below,
                  the combinations (3a AND 3b) or (3a AND 3c) will be accepted as diagnostic of
                  MPS II:

                    1. The patient has a deficiency in I2S enzyme activity of ≤10% of the lower
                       limit of the normal range as measured in plasma, fibroblasts, or leukocytes
                       (based on the reference laboratory's normal range). AND

                    2. The patient has a documented mutation in the I2S gene. OR

                    3. The patient has a normal enzyme activity level of one other sulfatase as
                       measured in plasma, fibroblasts, or leukocytes (based on the normal range
                       of measuring laboratory).

               4. The patient will be &lt;6 years of age at the start of Elaprase treatment.

               5. The patient, patient's parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s) must have
                  voluntarily signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics

               3. The patient has received growth hormones, a cord blood infusion, or a bone
                  marrow transplant at any time.

               4. The patient has received blood product transfusions within 90 days prior to
                  Screening.

               5. The patient is unable to comply with the protocol as determined by the
                  Investigator.

        Group 2: Retrospective Data Exclusion Criteria:

        HOS patients that meet the following criteria are not eligible to be included into the
        Study SHP-ELA-401 Primary Growth Analysis:

        1. Patient was treated with growth hormone or other medications or interventions intended
        to promote growth in the time period covered by the analysis.
