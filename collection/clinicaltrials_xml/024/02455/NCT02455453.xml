      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the uptake of a radioactive tracer
      21-18F-fluoro-16α,17α-[(R)-(1'-α-furylmethylidene)dioxy]-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (FFNP)
      uptake, which binds to breast cancer progesterone receptors (PgRs) on a PET/CT scan before
      and after administration of estradiol for one day (estrogen challenge) to determine if the
      change in uptake is a predictor of response to endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with
      hormone-sensitive estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. Estradiol is the most potent of the naturally occurring
      estrogens, and can be administered to treat menopausal symptoms and also sometimes to treat
      metastatic breast cancer. The investigators propose to study patients with biopsy-proven
      newly diagnosed, locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent breast cancer who are going to
      be treated with endocrine therapy (ET) (tamoxifen,aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant as
      standard of care therapy.

      Subjects will undergo a total of two FFNP-PET/CT scans; one before and a second one
      immediately following the one day estradiol challenge before the start of standard of care
      ET. The estradiol challenge will consist of administering a total of 6 mg of estradiol
      orally (three doses of 2 mg each) given at approximately 8 hour intervals and over a 24 hour
      period.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be postmenopausal defined as meeting one or more of the following:

               -  Age ≥ 60 years

               -  Amenorrheic for at least 12 months

               -  Surgically sterile- having undergone bilateral oophorectomy,

               -  FSH level in postmenopausal range according to institutional standards (note
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) laboratory testing must be ordered as
                  standard of care to determine optimal treatment and should not be ordered simply
                  to confirm eligibility to this study)

                    -  Premenopausal patients who are medically induced to become post-menopausal
                       for purposes of receiving endocrine therapy as standard of care treatment
                       are eligible with documentation of appropriate lab testing.

          2. Patient must have histological or cytological confirmed metastatic / locally advanced
             breast cancer.

          3. Patient must have any one of the following types of breast cancer: ER+/PgR+/HER2- or
             ER+/PgR-/HER2-.

               -  ER+ is defined as Allred score of at least 4 and greater.

               -  PgR+ is defined as Allred score of at least 4 and greater.

               -  Immuno-histochemistry or IHC is the primary assay methodology for HER2. HER2-
                  refers to HER2 of 0, 1+ by IHC or negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization
                  (FISH)

          4. Planned standard of care therapy for treatment of breast cancer with single agent
             endocrine therapy for a minimum of 6 months

          5. Patient must have at least one measurable lesion by radiological evaluation
             (ultrasound, mammography, MRI, CT, PET) or physical examination. Patients with
             evaluable osseous metastasis that are lytic or mixed lytic-sclerotic are eligible.

          6. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          7. Prior or chemotherapy or endocrine therapy for early stage disease is permitted if
             completed ≥ 12 months prior to study entry.

          8. The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             of 0-2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with other invasive malignancies, with the exception of non-melanoma skin
             cancer or cervical carcinoma in-situ, who had (or have) any evidence of the other
             cancer present within the last 5 years

          2. Unable to tolerate up to 60 min of PET imaging per imaging session.

          3. Patients with hepatic only disease are not eligible because of high hepatic uptake
             related to hepatobiliary elimination of FFNP.

          4. Patients with non-measurable non-evaluable lesions such as pleural effusion are not
             eligible to participate.

          5. Patients with vertebral lesions that, in the opinion of the principal Investigator
             and the treating medical oncologist, pose an imminent risk for cord compression.
