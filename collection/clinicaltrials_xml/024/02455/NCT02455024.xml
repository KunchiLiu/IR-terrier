  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to further characterize the safety profile of patients with
      chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CP-CML) treated with Iclusig (ponatinib) in
      routine clinical practice in the US. The study is focused on analysis of vascular occlusive
      events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted in an effort to better understand rates, risk factors, and
      outcomes associated with vascular occlusive events in patients treated with Iclusig
      (ponatinib) in real world settings. This study will collect information about patient
      demographics, leukemia diagnosis, previous anti-cancer treatments, history of cardiovascular
      disease, risk factors for vascular complications, and concurrent medications (including
      antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents).
