  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sufentanil tablet (ST) 30 mcg in the management of
      moderate-to-severe acute pain in patients in an emergency room (ER) setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, open-label trial, in patients 18 years and older, who present to
      the ER with moderate-to-severe acute pain due to obvious trauma or injury evident on
      physical examination.

      Upon meeting all entrance criteria, patients will be administered up to four doses of
      sufentanil 30 mcg and remain in the study for 5 hours for safety and efficacy measurements.

      Safety will be monitored via periodic measurement of vital signs and continuous monitoring
      of oxygen saturation, as well as assessment of adverse events (AEs) and the use of
      concomitant medications.

      Efficacy will be assessed by patient reports of pain intensity (PI) and pain relief. A
      Six-Item Screener (SIS) will be administered before and 1 hour after study drug
      administration to measure cognitive impairment. The Patient Global Assessment (PGA) and the
      Healthcare Professional Global Assessment (HPGA) will assess global satisfaction with the
      method of pain control.

    <description>The pain intensity difference (PID) at each evaluation time point after the first dose of study drug is the difference in pain intensity at the specific evaluation time point and baseline pain intensity [PID(evaluation time after the first dose) = Pain Intensity(baseline) - Pain Intensity(evaluation time after the first dose)]. The time-weighted SPID1 is the time-weighted summed PID over the first hour of the study period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who present to the ER with moderate-to-severe pain due to obvious trauma or
             injury evident on physical examination.

          -  Patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-III

          -  Patients who are willing and capable of understanding and cooperating with the
             requirements of the study.

          -  Patients able to understand and communicate in English.

          -  Patients who have provided written informed consent and signed the IRB approved
             consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have taken an opioid for more than 30 consecutive days, at a daily dose
             of more than 15 mg of morphine (or equivalent), within the past 3 months (e.g. more
             than 3 doses per day of Vicodin®, Norco®, Lortab® with 5 mg hydrocodone per tablet).

          -  Patients who have used any illicit drugs of abuse, abused prescription medication or
             alcohol (4 or more drinks per day) within one year before the start of the study.

          -  Patients with an allergy or hypersensitivity to opioids.

          -  Patients who are currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or have taken
             MAOIs within 14 days of the dose of study drug.

          -  Patients with current sleep apnea that has been documented by a sleep laboratory
             study or are on home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

          -  Female patients who are pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or breastfeeding.

          -  Patients with a medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could
             adversely impact the patient's participation or safety, conduct of the study, or
             interfere with the pain assessments, including chronic pain or active infection.

          -  Patients who present to the ER using supplemental oxygen.

          -  Patients who have participated in a clinical trial of an investigational drug or
             device within 30 days of enrollment.

          -  Patients who are active or reserve duty with the US military.
