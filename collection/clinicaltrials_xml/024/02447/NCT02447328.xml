    <textblock>
      This single-arm study aims to assess the safety and tolerability profile of
      Fulvestrant(Faslodex®) as 2nd line and later therapy in postmenopausal women with locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The primary objective is to evaluate the adverse
      events after Fulvestrant (Faslodex®) for about 6 months

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 4, single-arm, safety and tolerability study of fulvestrant
      (Faslodex®) as 2nd line therapy in postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic
      breast cancer.

      All of enrolled patients in this study will be injected fulvestrant (Faslodex®). This study
      will be performed for about 3 years and approximately 100 patients(actual target will be 80
      treated patients) will be enrolled in about 10 investigational sites.

      After obtaining the written informed consent from the patients, the information of
      demographic and medical history will be collected and laboratory tests will be performed.

      Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be injected the fulvestrant
      (Faslodex®) 500mg/month for about 6 months with an additional 500mg dose given 14 days after
      the initial dose injection. The information of adverse events will be collected after the
      1st dose of IP injection. In case that the evaluation of tumor response might be performed
      in regular clinical practice, those data will also be collected as well. The quality of life
      will also be measured.

Based on the data, disease control rate with 95% CI will be estimated. Also, disease control rate with 95% CI by patients' demographic data will be estimated. Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test will be performed.</description>
