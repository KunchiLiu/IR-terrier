      The primary objective is of the PreventADALL study is to test if primary prevention of
      allergic diseases is possible by simple and low cost strategies, and secondary to asses the
      impact of xenobiotic exposure and microbiota in and on the body and the environment on
      allergic disease development.

      The secondary objective is to investigate early life risk factors for development of asthma
      and allergic diseases as well as for diseases that may share common risk factors, including
      cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes.

      Design: A multi-national population-based prospective birth cohort with a factorial designed
      randomized controlled intervention trial of two clinical interventions; skin care 0-9 months
      and early food introduction by 3-4 months, thereafter observation only.

      Recruitment in three cities (Oslo, Østfold and Stockholm) of approximately 2500 babies is
      done in two steps; first pregnant women are recruited and enrolled at the 18-weeks
      ultrasound investigation (n=approximately 2700) and thereafter their new-born babies are
      included.

      Randomisation into four groups is done by the postal code or &quot;bydeler&quot; to ensure all four
      intervention-groups within each &quot;bydel&quot;.

      Visits for biological and environmental sampling, observations and investigations will be at
      the relevant paediatric departments (at 3-6-12-24 months of age) and annually thereafter. It
      is a hope that the study can be maintained well into adulthood.

      The PreventADALL study is a long term prospective birth cohort study enrolling pregnant
      women allowing for intra-uterine investigations of the baby and maternal factors during
      pregnancy, and thereafter including their new-born babies for long-term follow-up
      investigations.

      With the knowledge that allergic diseases often manifest in early infancy, interventions
      will be carried out as early as possible to investigate if allergic diseases can be
      prevented. Two interventions, early and systematic introduction to common foods, and early
      skin care are carried out within the first four months and the first nine months of life,
      respectively.

      Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:

      Ante-natal inclusion, step 1: All mothers to-be at 18 weeks ultrasound investigation with
      sufficient language skills (Norwegian or Swedish), gestational age: at least 16-22 weeks.
      Exclusion: Plans to move further than reasonable travel distance from any of the
      participating hospitals within the first year of the offspring's life.

      Inclusion of the child, step 2: Live-born babies of gestational age 35.0 weeks or more
      (including multiple pregnancies), maternal/parental willingness to participate in the study
      Exclusion criteria child: 1) severe neonatal cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, dermatologic
      disease or other disease that may influence the outcomes 2), plans to move further than
      reasonable travel distance away from any of the participating hospitals within the first
      nine months of life.

      3) Non-willingness to participate 4) More than two foetuses than two

      Overall design:

      A multi-national population-based prospective birth cohort with a factorial designed
      randomized controlled intervention trial of two clinical interventions; skin care 0-9 months
      and early food introduction by 3-4 months, thereafter observation only. Recruitment is done
      in two steps; first pregnant women at the 18-weeks ultrasound investigation and thereafter
      their new-born babies.

      Randomisation into four groups is done by the postal code or &quot;bydeler&quot; to ensure all four
      intervention-groups within each &quot;bydel&quot;.

      Electronic questionnaires will be completed by the mother at 18 and 34 weeks gestation, as
      well as for the baby at 3-6-9-12 months and annually thereafter. Also, an electronic diary
      will be completed each week from 2-26 weeks of age, to register weekly interventions, as
      well as symptoms of allergic diseases and food intake.

      Visits for biological and environmental sampling, observations and investigations will be at
      the relevant paediatric departments (at 3-6-12-24 months of age) and annually thereafter. It
      is a hope that the study can be maintained well into adulthood.

      The study will be run in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

      Investigations:

      Clinical investigations and biological sampling focuses on: General development, clinical
      assessments of health or disease, as well as diagnosing allergic disease and later also
      other non-communicable diseases (NCD)s.

      These include:

        -  Foetal growth and respiratory development

        -  Somatic growth and status (length, weight, body composition)

        -  Blood pressure

        -  Skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal and other relevant organs

        -  Skin barrier (trans epidermal water loss (TEWL))

        -  Lung function and -development

        -  Microbiota/diversity (in and on the body and the environment)

        -  Viral infections

        -  Immune-deviation/tolerance development

        -  Specific allergen antibodies (IgE/IgG)

        -  Xenobiotics and interactions between exposures (microbiota/xenobiotics)

        -  Genetics/epi-genetics

      Outcome measures:

      Primary outcomes assessed yearly, but first time at six months of age:

        1. Atopic dermatitis (AD), Food allergy to any intervention allergen

        2. Allergic sensitisation (yes/no as well as quantitative, by skin prick test and s-IgE)
           Secondary outcomes: annually (ie 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months): asthma (bronchial
           obstruction in year 1-2) and/or food allergy to any other allergen and/or anaphylaxis
           and/or allergic rhinitis Later outcomes will be defined in terms of obesity,
           cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.

      Interventions:

      Skin intervention (IS): Skin care is performed from week 2 through 8 months of age,
      supervised by study personnel prior to leaving the hospital.

      Food intervention (IF): Major food allergens (cow's milk, peanut, wheat, egg) are introduced
      no later than 4.0 months of age as tastes, not interfering with nutrition.

      Safety assessment: An external surveying committee to assess adverse events and main
      outcomes will be established prior to study start.

      The purpose is to observe potential large differences in the major outcome in the four
      groups. Monitoring of adverse events will occur from August 2015 to December 2017 in terms
      of the main outcomes: from first baby 6 months, until all babies are at least nine months
      age. In case of a significant difference (effect size to be determined) the committee may
      advice on discontinuation of intervention, further close assessment or continued
      intervention.

      Statistical approaches: Stratum randomization, logistic regression analyses (primary
      outcomes), mixed models (continuous outcomes particularly of allergic sensitisation by
      quantification) will be applied. An external surveillance committee will be established, who
      will have monthly reports on the outcomes, with the potential to stop the trial in case of
      large differences in the groups. However, due to the short time span of observation before
      the interventions are completed, it is unlikely that intervention differences may be
      observed prior to completion.

      Power analysis lack underlying data and is therefore based upon the prevalence (ECA study)
      of AD at two years of age for skin barrier intervention only. The prevalence (%) of (ever)
      allergic disease in the ECA study were at 2, 10 and 16 years of age: Asthma: 8 (recurrent
      bronchial obstruction), 20 and 26.4%, Atopic eczema: 23.2, 33.2 and 34.8%, Allergic rhinitis
      (10 and 16 years): 19 and 32.1%, Allergic sensitization (10/16 years): 37.4 and 52.6%,
      respectively. Data on food allergy is lacking.

      The investigators' pilot study suggested a prevalence reduction in AD from 16 to four % at
      6-months of age in children with dry skin subjected to skin care from 2 weeks. Thus, an
      estimated reduction from 23.2 % to 18.2 % (five per cent points) in a general population
      would be highly clinically relevant, worthwhile and feasible and require 1030 children in
      each skin care versus observation group to attain an 80 % power at 5% significance level. A
      reduction to 19.2 % (four per cent points) requires 1638 children per group.

      Recent publications demonstrated approximately 30% reduction in atopic dermatitis at 32
      weeks of age after daily use of skin care and 50% risk reduction at 6 months of age in 124
      high risk children, respectively suggesting that approx. 2500 babies in total will be
      sufficient to detect significant and relevant reductions in AD i a factorially 2x2 designed
      study.

      In line with emerging study results (2015) the power-estimates will be repeated with
      potential modification of population size requirement intil the target population is
      recruited.

      Study Phases:

      The first phase of the PreventADALL study; to establish the birth cohort study, collect
      information and biological samples, closely assess the children in the first 2 years of
      life, assess the impact of the two interventions and the impact of microbiota and xenobiotic
      exposure on early allergic disease presentation.

      This phase will also create the foundation for a long-term follow-up study with careful
      assessments of potential risk or protective factors for allergic as well as other NCDs at
      the start of life. The PreventADALL study will lead to improved knowledge of the potential
      effect of primary prevention and of management of allergic diseases in early life as well as
      improving knowledge of risk factors for NCDs later in life.
