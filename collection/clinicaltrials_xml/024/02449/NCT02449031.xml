  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, two cohort, observational study over a 5-year period in
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.The study will
      collect data over 1 year on respiratory function, antibacterial effectiveness, and clinical
      outcomes of treatment with inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics and data over 5 years on
      microbiological and safety assessments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include CF patients chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa enrolled in the
      Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) PortCF registry and using TOBI Podhaler or another
      FDA-approved inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotic. No therapeutic intervention will be
      assigned and physicians will use their discretion in choosing a treatment regimen for their
      patients.

      Sputum samples (primarily collected during routine clinical follow-up) from patients able to
      spontaneously produce sputum will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis.

      In addition, this study will include two optional sub-studies for qualifying patients in the
      first study year - Sputum microbiology sub-study and TOBI Podhaler sputum pharmacokinetics
      (PK) sub-study.

          -  Current participation in an interventional clinical study with an inhaled antibiotic
             treatment.

          -  Treatment with compounded tobramycin (e.g. the use of tobramycin IV solution adapted
             for use by inhalation).

          -  Treatment with inhaled antipseudomonal antibacterial drug(s) that are not FDA
