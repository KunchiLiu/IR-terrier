    <measure>Change from Baseline in Lung Clearance Index (LCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to Day 29 in LCI as measured by multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) technique. MBNW is the time taken to wash out nitrogen while breathing 100% oxygen.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in FEV1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Change From Baseline to Day 29 in FEV1 will be measured by spirometry. Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) is the amount of air that can be exhaled in 1 second. All spirometry calibrations and evaluations will follow the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society guidelines for acceptability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events receiving QBW251</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be measured by number and percentage of participants with adverse events.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics: Plasma concentration of QBW251 by CMax</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is the observed maximum plasma concentration following drug administration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in FVC</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Change From Baseline to Day 29 in FVC will be measured by spirometry. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the maximum amount of air a person can expel from the lungs after a maximum inhalation. All spirometry calibrations and evaluations will follow the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society guidelines for acceptability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in TLC</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Change From Baseline to Day 29 in TLC will be measured by spirometry. Total lung capacity (TLC) is the volume in the lungs at maximal inflation. All spirometry calibrations and evaluations will follow the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society guidelines for acceptability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in RV</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Change From Baseline to Day 29 in RV will be measured by spirometry. Residual volume (RV) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. All spirometry calibrations and evaluations will follow the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society guidelines for acceptability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in FRC</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Change From Baseline to Day 29 in FRC will be measured by spirometry. Functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume in the lungs at the end-expiratory position. All spirometry calibrations and evaluations will follow the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society guidelines for acceptability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in DLCO</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is the extent to which oxygen passes from the lung to the blood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics: Plasma concentration of QBW251 by TMax</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Tmax is the time to reach the maximum concentration after drug administration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics: Plasma concentration of QBW251 by AUClast</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>AUClast is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics: Plasma concentration of QBW251 by AUC0-12h</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>AUC 0-12h is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 12 hours.</description>
