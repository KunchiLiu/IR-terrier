      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study evaluating the efficacy of certolizumab
      pegol in the treatment of interstitial cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic disabling bladder syndrome characterized by urinary
      frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, and pain or discomfort with bladder filling. There is
      no cure for IC and the treatment options are suboptimal. Patients with IC report significant
      negative effects on their physical and mental quality of life. The etiology of IC is
      unknown. Certain aspects of IC suggest that autoimmunity may play a role in initiating or
      sustaining the chronic inflammatory response. Bladder biopsies of patients with IC
      demonstrate an increase number of mast cells. Mast cell activation with the release of tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) may mediate this bladder inflammation. Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) is
      a medication that blocks the effect of TNF. Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) is FDA approved for
      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and
      Crohn's disease. These diseases are similar to IC. In this study, the hypothesis being
      tested is that Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) will show efficacy in improving the symptoms of
      patients with IC.
