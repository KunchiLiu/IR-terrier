    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the brain cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CH24H)
      enzyme occupancy of TAK-935 after single oral dose in healthy participants using the
      positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [18F]MNI-792 and PET imaging and to determine the
      relationship of occupancy to TAK-935 exposure.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935. TAK-935 is being tested to examine
      the degree and duration of brain CH24H enzyme occupancy/target engagement as a function of
      TAK-935 plasma concentration in order to guide dosing and schedule for future clinical
      trials with TAK-935.This study will utilize the PET ligand [18F]MNI-792 to evaluate the
      brain CH24H occupancy of TAK-935 after single dose oral administration in healthy adult
      participants. The study will evaluate up to 16 participants. The first 2 participants will
      take TAK-935 600 mg oral solution and undergo PET imaging using tracer [18F]MNI-792 up to 5
      microgram (up to 370 MBq), injection, intravenously prior to each PET scan at Baseline, 45
      minutes and 10 hours post-TAK-935 dose. TAK-935 dose and timing of post-dose scans for
      subsequent participants will be based on the data from the previous participants. This
      single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study is up to 55 days. Participants will make 4 visits to the clinic, including 2
      confinement periods to the clinic for PET imaging. Participants will be contacted by phone
      on Day 22 for follow-up safety assessments.

    <measure>Cholesterol 24S-Hydroxylase (CH24H) Brain Enzyme Occupancy as a Function of TAK-935 Plasma Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1), after first and second [18F]MNI-792 PET tracer injection on Days 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>CH24H target occupancy after a single dose of TAK-935 obtained by graphical analysis according to the global occupancy plot will be calculated as: VT (Baseline) - VT (Day 1) = Occupancy (Day 1) * (VT (Baseline) - VND), where VT (Baseline) and VT (Day 1) are the total distribution volumes obtained at Baseline and after TAK-935 administration, respectively and VND is the non-displaceable volume of distribution. The occupancy is determined as the slope of the linear regression of the plot, and the non-displaceable volume of distribution VND as the x-intercept.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Concentration of TAK-935 during Postdose PET Scan Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 and 2: at the time of tracer injection, 1 and 2 hours post-tracer injection</time_frame>
    <description>The concentrations of TAK-935 in plasma will be summarized by dose level over each scheduled sampling time point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change from Baseline in Maximum Observed Effect (Emax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1): 1, 4, and 12 hours post check-in; Day 1: pre-dose (within 30 minutes prior to dosing), 1, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24 and 30 hours post-TAK-935 dose</time_frame>
    <description>Emax is defined as the maximum observed effect post-TAK-935 dose. Emax is the measure of change in plasma concentration of 24S hydroxycholesterol (24HC). Percent change from Baseline Emax will be determined, as appropriate, depending on the Baseline profile of plasma 24HC.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change from Baseline in the Area under the Effect-Time Curve from Time 0 to Last 24HC Sampling Time Point (t) (AUECt)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1): 1, 4, and 12 hours post check-in; Day 1: pre-dose (within 30 minutes prior to dosing), 1, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24 and 30 hours post-TAK-935 dose.</time_frame>
    <description>AUECt is the area under the effect-time curve from time 0 to last sampling time point (t). TAK-935 effect was measured from the change in the plasma concentration of 24HC. Percent change from Baseline AUECt will be determined, as appropriate, depending on the Baseline profile of plasma 24HC.</description>
