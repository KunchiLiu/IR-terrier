  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ceftazidime and avibactam
      (CAZ-AVI )versus cefepime in children from 3 months to less than 18 years old with
      complicated urinary tract infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-blind, randomised, multi-centre, active controlled trial.
      Patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years with complicated urinary tract infections
      (cUTIs) will be randomised to 1 of 2 treatment groups (3:1 ratio): Ceftazidime and avibactam
      (CAZ AVI )or cefepime. Randomisation will be stratified by age cohort.

      Patients will receive intravenous (IV) treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, ie,
      9 doses if given 3 times daily, or 6 doses if given twice daily) before having the option to
      switch to an oral therapy . The decision to switch to oral therapy is entirely at the
      Investigator's discretion, if the patient has good or sufficient clinical response, and the
      patient is tolerating oral fluids or food.

      Patients will be assessed for safety and efficacy throughout the study, and blood samples
      will be taken for pharmacokinetic assessment. The duration of each patient's participation
      in the study will be a minimum of 27 days to a maximum of 50 days after start of study
      treatment including (intravenous treatment or oral switch therapy) 7 to 14 days of active
      treatment. The late follow-up visit (LFU) is to be performed 20 to 36 days after the last
      dose of any treatment.

      The assessments at the test of cure (TOC) visit should be performed in person 8 to 15 days
      after last dose of any study drug Maximum duration of study drug or oral switch therapy is
      up to Day 14.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be ≥3 calendar months to &lt;18 years of age. Patients aged ≥3 calendar months to
             &lt;1 year must have been born at term (defined as gestational age ≥37 weeks).

          2. Written informed consent from parent(s) or other legally acceptable
             representative(s), and informed assent from patient (if age appropriate according to
             local regulations)

          3. If female and has reached menarche, or has reached Tanner stage 3 development (even
             if not having reached menarche) (refer to Appendix E for further details on Tanner
             staging), the patient is authorised to participate in this clinical study if the
             following criteria are met:

             At screening:

             (i) (a) Patient reports sexual abstinence for the prior 3 months or reports use of at
             least 1 of the acceptable methods of contraception, including an intrauterine device
             (with copper banded coil), levonorgestrel intrauterine system (eg, Mirena®), or
             regular medroxyprogesterone injections (Depo-Provera®); or (b) Patient agrees to
             initiate sexual abstinence from the time of screening until 7 days after end of
             treatment with study drug; and (ii) Patient is advised to avoid conception from the
             time of screening until 7 days after receipt of study drug and agrees not to attempt
             pregnancy from the time of screening until 7 days after end of treatment with study
             drug; and (iii) Patient is provided guidelines regarding continuation of abstinence,
             initiation of abstinence, or about allowed contraception; and (iv) Patient has a
             negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test just prior to study entry.
             Since serum tests may miss an early pregnancy, relevant menstrual history and sexual
             history, including methods of contraception, should be considered. Note: if the
             result of the serum β-hCG test cannot be obtained prior to dosing of investigational
             product, a patient may be enrolled on the basis of a negative urine pregnancy test,
             though a serum β-hCG test result must still be obtained.

          4. Patient has a clinically suspected and/or bacteriologically documented cUTI or acute
             pyelonephritis judged by the Investigator to be serious and requires the patient to
             be hospitalised for treatment with intravenous (IV) therapy

          5. Patient has pyuria:

             Cohorts 1 to 3 as determined by a midstream clean catch or clean urethral
             catheterisation urine specimen with ≥10 white blood cells (WBCs) per high power field
             on standard examination of urine sediment or ≥10 WBCs/mm3 in unspun urine Cohort 4a
             and 4b as determined by a midstream clean catch or clean urethral catheterisation
             urine specimen or urine specimen obtained using urine collection pads(or supra-pubic
             collection if standard procedure in the assigned sites) ≥5 WBCs per high-power field
             on standard examination of urine sediment or ≥5 WBCs/mm3 in unspun urine

          6. Patient has a positive urine culture: 1 midstream clean catch or clean urethral
             catheterisation urine specimen taken within 48 hours of randomisation containing ≥105
             colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of a recognised uropathogen known to be susceptible to
             the IV study therapy (CAZ-AVI and cefepime) Note: If patients meet all of entry
             criteria except for positive urine culture as outlined above, the patients may be
             enrolled before urine culture results are available if the results are likely (based
             on urinalysis and clinical findings) to be positive and study drugs are considered
             appropriate empiric therapy. If a patient urine culture is negative after 24 or 48
             hours of treatment but the patient is improving, the Investigator can keep the
             patient on treatment. If the urine culture is negative and the patient is not
             improving, study treatment will be stopped, and the patient will be followed for the
             rest of the study including undergoing all safety assessments until late follow up
             (LFU).

          7. Demonstrates either acute pyelonephritis or complicated lower UTI as defined by the
             following criteria:

               1. Qualifying criteria: patients must have at least 1 of the following
                  signs/symptoms (signs/symptoms must have onset or have worsened within 7 days of
