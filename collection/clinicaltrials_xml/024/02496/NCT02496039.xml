    <textblock>
      Eligible patients for this study must have a diagnosis of a neurological disorder affecting
      the brain of at least 3 months duration prior to baseline and which is not rapidly
      progressing and must have a diagnosis of Pseudobulbar affect (PBA).

      This is a multicenter, open label study consisting of 6 months of treatment.

      Approximately 125 patients will be enrolled at approximately 25 centers in the United
      States.
