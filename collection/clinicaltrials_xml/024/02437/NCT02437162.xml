  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of ustekinumab, in adult participants
      with active radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), who are naive to anti-TNF alpha
      agents, as measured by the reduction in signs and symptoms of radiographic AxSpA.

      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the
      participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment
      [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug
      has a real effect) study. The study consists of 3 phases; Screening (up to 8 weeks),
      Treatment phase: placebo-controlled (Week 0 to 24) and active treatment (Week 24 to Week
      100), and Safety Follow-up (12 weeks after last dose). Participants will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, ustekinumab 45 mg and ustekinumab 90 mg. The
      total duration of study will be up to 112 weeks. Participants will be primarily assessed for
      Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 40 response at Week 24.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the trial.

    <description>ASAS 40 is defined as improvement of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 40% from baseline and absolute improvement from baseline of at least 2 on a 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) scale in at least 3 of the following 4 domains: Patient's global assessment of disease activity (0 to 10 cm; 0=very well, 10=very poor), Total back pain (0 to 10 cm; 0=no pain, 10=most severe pain), Function (self-assessment represented as a mean (0 to 10 cm; 0=easy to 10=impossible) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to the participant's functional anatomy and 2 of which relate to a participant's ability to cope with everyday life, Inflammation (0 to 10 cm; 0=none, 10=very severe); and absence of deterioration ( no worsening at all from baseline in the remaining domain) from baseline in the potential remaining domain.</description>

    <description>ASAS 20 is defined as improvement of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20% from baseline and absolute improvement from baseline of at least 1 on a 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) scale in at least 3 of the following 4 domains: Patient's global assessment of disease activity (0 to 10 cm; 0=very well, 10=very poor), Total back pain (0 to 10 cm; 0=no pain, 10=most severe pain), Function (self-assessment represented as a mean (0 to 10 cm; 0=easy to 10=impossible) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to the participant's functional anatomy and 2 of which relate to a participant's ability to cope with everyday life, Inflammation (0 to 10 cm; 0=none, 10=very severe); and absence of deterioration (worsening of &gt;=20% and at least 1 on a 0 to 10 cm scale) from baseline in the potential remaining domain.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve at Least 50% Improvement From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI is used to measure the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) disease severity. It consists of 6 questions: fatigue, spinal pain, arthralgia (joint pain) or swelling, enthesitis (inflammation of tendons and ligaments), and morning stiffness (2 questions: duration and severity). Each question is an easy to answer 10cm visual analog scale (VAS), with 1 being none, and 10 being very severe. In order to give each of the 5 symptoms equal weight, the mean of the 2 questions about morning stiffness will be added to the total of the remaining 4 scores, and the final BASDAI score (ranging 0-10) is the average of the overall total score. Higher BASDAI score indicates more severe AS symptom.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASFI is composed with 10 questions to assess the disease severity, including the first 8 questions regarding to functional anatomy related activities and the remaining 2 questions related to daily activities of AS participants. Each question is a 10cm VAS with a value between 0 (easy) and 10 (impossible). The final BASFI score is the mean of the 10 scores. Higher BASFI score indicates more severe functional limitations of the participant due to AS.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieve Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) (CRP) Inactive Disease at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ASDAS is composite score based on the calculation of 5 disease activities: 4 are participant's reported outcomes (back pain, duration of morning stiffness, participant global and peripheral pain/swelling) and one serologic inflammation marker (creatinine reactive protein - CRP). The score is the sum of the 5 items with different specified weights, with a minimum of 0 and no upper limit. Thus this index can reflect both long term disease activity and acute phase status. There are 3 cut-offs in score to show: a) the 4 states of disease activity: inactive disease (&lt;1.3), moderate disease activity (1.3-2.1), high disease activity (2.1-3.5) and very high disease activity (&gt;3.5). b) effectiveness of the treatment, two validated cut-offs were developed: a change of 1.1-2.0 (clinically important improvement) and a change &gt;2.0 (major improvement).</description>
