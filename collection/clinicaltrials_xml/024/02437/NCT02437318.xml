  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant prolongs progression-free
      survival compared to fulvestrant and placebo in men and postmenopausal women with hormone
      receptor positive (HR+), HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, who received prior treatment
      with an Aromatase Inhibitor either as (neo)adjuvant or for advanced disease.
