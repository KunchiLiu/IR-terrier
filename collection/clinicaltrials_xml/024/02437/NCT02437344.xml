  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid dependence is a substantial problem associated with significant morbidity and
      mortality. Extended-release naltrexone has been found effective at reducing opioid use and
      maintaining abstinence, but its use has been limited by the difficulties encountered with
      treatment initiation, which involves detoxification from opioids and oral naltrexone
      titration. Improving the likelihood of a successful transition to naltrexone is therefore an
      important public health goal.

      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonism has been found to alleviate the signs and
      symptoms of withdrawal from opioids, as well as to address adaptations associated with
      chronic opioid use, such as opioid-induced hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity). These
      benefits may persist for at least 72 hours after a single dose. NMDA antagonism may
      therefore facilitate a rapid transition to naltrexone by reducing discomfort, improving
      motivation, and ameliorating adaptations associated with drug dependence, such as craving
      and arousal.

      The purpose of this trial is to assess the feasibility of NMDA antagonist-assisted
      naltrexone initiation in opioid dependent individuals. After administration of
      extended-release naltrexone, participants will be followed for 4 weeks, and transitioned to
      appropriate care subsequently (oral naltrexone, extended-release naltrexone).
