  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laryngeal dysfunction is a problem that affects many patients after laryngeal cancer therapy
      (surgery or radio/chemotherapy). Laryngeal dysfunction is associated with higher incidences
      of aspiration and respiratory tract complications such as aspiration pneumonia. Current
      standard of care treatment to reduce the consequences of aspiration is often a tracheostomy
      which has its own risks and complications. The proposed study aims to describe the
      performance of a new CE marked medical implant, the NewBreez, in protecting the patient's
      airways from aspiration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspiration is associated with respiratory tract infections, reduced quality of life and
      increased mortality in patients. For chronic or unresolved aspiration, patients are often
      given a tracheostomy for safer breathing and greater protection of the airways from
      aspirated material. However tracheostomies are associated with risks and complications and
      do not give a 100% guarantee of aspiration protection to the patient. They also impact the
      quality of life in a negative way for many patients. The current study will evaluate the
      performance of a new intralaryngeal device for airway protection in a small group of
      patients who have chronic aspiration. The study will look at the overall performance of this
      device in preventing aspiration in this specific group of patients as well as determine any
      unforeseen risks of using this device in the identified group of patients. The outcomes will
      form the basis of future studies with larger groups of patients.

        Recruitment of patients will primarily be from the department of Ear, Nose and Throat at
        the hospitals participating in the study. Secondary recruitment could also include
        associated clinics that treat patients with laryngeal dysfunction and aspiration, such as
        swallowing therapy clinics, speech language therapy clinics, and linguistics clinics.
