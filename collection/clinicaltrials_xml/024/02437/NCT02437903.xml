  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the efficacy and safety of JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC when used in the
      facial temporal regions based on the change in the score of the investigator's Temporal.
      This study will be an open label, single center study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volume deficit in the temporal area (the side of the forehead) of the face is a common sign
      of aging.

      JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC is a dermal filler, which was FDA-approved in October 2013 for the
      improvement and correction of age-related volume deficit in the mid-face area.

      JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC is a gel implant composed of 20 mg/mL hyaluronic acid (HA) formulation,
      produced by Streptococcus equi bacteria, and 0.3 w/w lidocaine. JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC is a
      clear, sterile, and biodegradable gel indicated for subcutaneous and/or supraperiosteal
      injection.

      JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XCwill be injected in the temple area and subjects will be followed for 12
      months.
