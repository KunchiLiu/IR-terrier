             involved an emergency department visit, hospitalization, or use of oral/parenteral
             corticosteroids within 6 weeks of Screening (Visit 1a).

          3. Seasonal or Exercise-Induced Asthma Alone: Subjects with only seasonal or
             exerciseinduced asthma are excluded from participation.

          4. Concurrent Respiratory Disease: A subject must not have current evidence or diagnosis
             of pneumonia, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrotic disease, chronic
             bronchitis, emphysema, COPD, or other respiratory abnormalities other than asthma.

          5. Concurrent Conditions/Diseases: A subject with historical or current evidence of any
             clinically significant, or comorbid or uncontrolled condition or disease state that,
             in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
             through study participation or would confound the interpretation of the results if
             the condition/disease exacerbated during the study.

          6. Smoking History: Current smokers or former smokers who have stopped smoking within 6
             months prior to enrollment or with a &gt;10 pack year history of cigarettes, cigars, or
             pipe smoking. E-cigarettes and inhaled marijuana should be treated in the same manner
             as tobacco products.

          7. Inhaled Anticholinergic Use: Subjects must not have used inhaled anticholinergics for
             at least the 2 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1a).

          9. Respiratory Tract Infection: Subjects who have had a respiratory tract infection
             within 6 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1a). Subjects who develop a respiratory
             tract infection during the Screening Period must discontinue from the trial, but will
             be permitted to reenroll at a later date (at least 6 weeks after the resolution of
             the respiratory tract infection).

         10. Uncontrolled Hypertension: Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have
             clinically significant uncontrolled hypertension.

         11. Liver Function: Subjects with abnormal liver function tests defined as aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, or
             total bilirubin ≥1.5 times the upper limit of normal on repeat testing.

         12. Renal: a. Subjects with symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy that is clinically
             significant in the opinion of the Investigator (if treated and asymptomatic, the
             subject is eligible for enrollment). Subjects with a trans-urethral resection of
             prostate or full resection of the prostate within 6 months prior to Visit 1a are
             excluded from the study.

             b. Subjects with bladder neck obstruction or urinary retention that is clinically
             significant in the opinion of the Investigator. c. Subjects with a calculated

             to Visit 3. Note: Subjects with overactive bladder syndrome treated with oral
             anticholinergics that have been on treatment for at least one month are allowed in
             the study.

         13. Glaucoma: Subjects with a diagnosis of angle closure glaucoma will be excluded,
             regardless of whether or not they have been treated. Subjects with a diagnosis of
             glaucoma (non-angle closure), that in the opinion of the Investigator, has not been
             adequately treated will also be excluded. Subjects with previously diagnosed glaucoma
             who have intraocular pressure controlled with medication(s) are eligible. All
             medications approved for control of intraocular pressures are allowed including
             topical ophthalmic non-selective β-blockers such as betaxolol, carteolol,

             have been resected for cure are not considered exclusionary. Subjects with localized
             prostate cancer that in the opinion of the Investigator, has been adequately worked
             up, is clinically controlled, and the subject's participation in the study would not
             represent a safety concern, are eligible.

         15. Drug Allergy: Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to lactose, milk
             proteins, or to any component of the MDI or dry powder inhaler (DPI)
