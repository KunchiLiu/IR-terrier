  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activity of COTI-2 has been demonstrated in the OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer tumor model. With its
      p53- and AKT-based mechanisms of action, COTI-2 is anticipated to be highly relevant in
      treatment of patients with gynecologic malignancies.

      This study is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of COTI-2 in patients
      with advanced and recurrent gynecologic and head and neck malignancies and to establish a
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future studies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single center, open-label, Phase 1, first time in human study of
      COTI-2 in patients with recurrent ovarian,fallopian tube,primary peritoneal cancer,
      endometrial, cervical or head and neck cancer. COTI-2 will be self-administered as a single
      agent, orally, once daily for 5 days followed by 2 treatment-free days each week.
