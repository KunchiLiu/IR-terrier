      This is a multi centre, prospective trial. 250 patients will be enrolled in the study.(10
      patients per centre involving approximately 25 centres). Patients will be followed up
      clinically for twelve months post-procedure at 1 month, 6 months &amp; 12 months. All patients
      will have a repeat angiography at 8 months. Clinical follow-up will be maintained for years
      3 &amp; 5 post-implant.

      This is a multi centre, prospective observational study. 250 patients will be enrolled in
      the study. 10 patients per centre involving approximately 25 centres. All the patients will
      be followed for twelve months post-procedure. All patients will have a repeat angiography
      assessment at 8 months. An additional clinical follow-up will be maintained for years 3 &amp; 5
      post-implant.

      Approximately 250 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease with a vessel size
      between ≥2.5 to ≤3.5 mm in diameter by visual estimate and who meet all eligibility criteria
      will be treated with the Sirolimus Eluting Stent.

      It is anticipated that the total length of the study will be 16 months: 4 months to complete
      patient enrollment and 12 months for angiographic follow-up.
