  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of AZD3293 on how the body absorbs and
      processes 3 other medications, midazolam, simvastatin and donepezil and how these 3
      medications affect AZD3293 when they are taken together. This study is in 2 groups, group A
      is approximately 44 days long and group B about 70 days only. The screening visit is
      required within 30 days prior to the start on the study

      Astra Zeneca (AZ) registered this trial as sponsor. In July, 2015, sponsorship changed to
      Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly). In August, 2015, AZ transferred this trial to Lilly's
      ClinicalTrials.gov account and Lilly updated the record. This trial is not an applicable
      trial under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA).
