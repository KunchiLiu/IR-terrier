      The purpose of the study is to understand if there is benefit in treatment with a medicine
      called enzalutamide in the re-treatment setting. Patients must have been previously treated
      with enzalutamide in the pre-chemotherapy setting for a minimum of 8 months and have disease
      progressed, followed by docetaxel and/or cabazitaxel for at least 4 cycles.

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects will receive treatment with open-label enzalutamide, until radiographic or clinical
      progression (such as pathological fracture, cord compression, worsened pain requiring
      radiation therapy, or opioid analgesic dose increase or initiation), or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients may be allowed to continue enzalutamide until the next treatment is
      initiated. If another non-cytotoxic, non-investigational, antineoplastic agent is initiated
      after protocol-defined progression has been determined, enzalutamide may be continued as
      long as the patient is tolerating enzalutamide and continues androgen deprivation therapy.
      Subjects will have a safety follow-up visit approximately 30 days following the last dose of
      study drug or prior to the initiation of a subsequent anti-cancer drug or investigational
      agent, whichever occurs first. Disease progression and survival will be followed every 12
      weeks for a maximum of 3 years from first dose. The study will end when the last subject has
      been followed for 1 year from date of first dose
