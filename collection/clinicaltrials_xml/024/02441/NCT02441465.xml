  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single intravenous (IV)
      infusion of ^14 C-labeled vemurafenib administered shortly after an oral dose of vemurafenib
      and following multiple oral doses of vemurafenib twice daily (BID) at steady state as well
      as to estimate the absolute bioavailability of multiple oral doses of vemurafenib BID at
      steady state in participants with BRAF^V600 mutation-positive malignancies.
