      The purpose of this research study is to assess the clinical effectiveness of a minimally
      invasive alveolar microperforation procedure to achieve accelerated tooth movement in
      patients undergoing orthodontic treatment for orthognathic surgery. &quot;Accelerated tooth
      movement&quot; means that Microperforation technique may help complete orthodontic treatment
      sooner than would be expected in conventional orthodontic treatment

      SAMPLE: For this retrospective study, 50 individuals will be selected, with skeletal
      discrepancies randomly divided into two groups: 1 - accelerated tooth movement technique
      (ATMT) and 2 - Control .

      METHODS: MATERIAL - Orthodontic records done in two times, initial and preoperative; Plaster
      models of dental extracted jaw every 28 days; Cone Beam Computed tomography done in two
      times, initial and in the end of extraction space closure.

      METHODS: Orthodontic Treatment: to activate extraction space closure, light orthodontic
      traction will be made in anterior teeth, to maintain therapeutic osteopenia until contact
      point between the canine the second pre -molar.

      Cortical perforations - ATMT Group: Flapless cortical perforations will be made after dental
      extraction. Surgical protocol will be flapless to preserve periodontal health. After local
      anesthesia, minimum cortical perforations will be done with manual instrument, between 4-6
      mm apical to the contour of free gum between the canine and second pre-molar. Two
      perforations near each tooth adjacent to the extraction area.

      Results: On plaster models - shortest distance between two adjacent teeth to the extraction
      space will be measure with caliper.

      Cone-Beam Computed Tomography: after image acquisition , data will be previously converted
      to DICOM , to converted to GIPL in ITK-SNAP 3.2 software. In Imagine software voxels will be
      converted to size 0.5 mm for further construction of virtual three-dimensional models,
      through segmentation of anatomical structures again in ITK-SNAP 3.2 software. This
      segmentation will be made by the full selection of all maxilla and mandible anatomically and
      individually, with the limit all skeletal outline available, including teeth. After 3D
      models generation, specific control targeting to fill all narrow spaces, so that they are
      not excluded from the virtual model and the external cortical displacements are the only
      ones to be computed in the comparative evaluation between later time. Then regional overlay
      3D models will be done using Imagine software. For overlapping structures: In mandible will
      use along the edge of the mandibular symphysis; maxilla, posterior nasal spine. Overlap is
      automatic because software compares voxels grayscale to reference region to overlap
      spatially. Displacement evaluation will be done with Mirit software through colorful maps
      generated by calculating the distances between points of two representatives surfaces. These
      maps differentiate the movements between surfaces. For quantification metric, specific
      online tool is used to measure the displacement in millimeters. We will evaluate
      quantitative displacement for space closure, closing speed, the possible changes throughout
      the maxillomandibular complex and compared between groups. Ossification area volume will be
      compared using Hounsfield scale. After collecting data, the results will be statistically
      analyzed.
