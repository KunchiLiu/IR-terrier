  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anastomotic leak is a devastating complication of colorectal surgery. There is no widespread
      means of assessing the viability of a laparoscopic anastomosis. The investigators described
      recently the feasibility of microvascularisation assessment with near-infra red technology
      (NIR).

      The aim of this study is to look at the implementation of this technique in a wider
      prospective series of patients undergoing colorectal resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicentric prospective study of 260 consecutive patients undergoing colonic resection and
      being assessed during the course of surgery for microvascularisation.

      After vessel division and after colorectal anastomosis, indocyanine green (2.5mg/ml) is
      injected intravenously and anastomotic microvascularisation assessed with the PinPoint NIR
      system (Novadaq, Vancouver, Canada).

      Study primary endpoint is the anastomotic leak rate Secondary endpoint are peroperative and
      post-operative complications according to the Clavien Dindo scale, time of the procedure and
      time to record a signal as well as any change of the procedure.

      This study will be performed on 3 different sites Geneva, Oxford and Dublin University
      Hospitals

    <description>If the vascularisation is insufficient during the surgery, the investigators can change the course of the surgery he is performing. For example, it could lead to a second resection to obtain well vascularized tissue for the anastomosis. Any alteration of the regular course of surgery for the safety of the patient is reported. The number of patient requiring an alteration of the course of surgery will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Patient will have their anastomosis assessed after they receive 7.5 to 9 mg of Indocyanine green intravenously (at a concentration of 2.5mg/ml).
The microvascularisation assessment will be performed using a near infrared device(Pinpoint device), allowing to increase reality.
This procedure will be repeated twice during the surgery, the first time before and the second time after the anastomosis has been done.</description>
