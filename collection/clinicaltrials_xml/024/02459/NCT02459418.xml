      Comparative PK study after single SC application of Afolia and the reference product (US
      Gonal-f®). Objective: To demonstrate equivalence within 80%-125% margin of the reference
      product for the area under the curve (AUC) of Afolia.

      To demonstrate equivalence within the 80% to 125% margin of the reference product for the
      baseline corrected area under the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) serum
      concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration of AFOLIA
      compared to the reference product (United States [US] Gonal-f® RFF )
