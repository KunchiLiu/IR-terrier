  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social processes that impact the health of individuals have been labeled the social
      determinants of health (SDOH). These are &quot;the conditions in which people are born, grow,
      live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and
      resources at global, national and local levels&quot;. Perhaps the most important SDOH is income
      security, a person's actual, perceived and expected income. Our objective is to carry out a
      pragmatic randomized controlled trial that evaluates the impact of an income-focused health
      promoter.

      This study aims to answer the question: What is the impact of an income security health
      promotion service based in a primary care setting on the income security of people living in
      poverty? Our hypothesis is that an income security health promotion service as a small but
      significant impact on the income security of a minority of participants. We will carry out a
      pragmatic randomized controlled trial that evaluates the impact of such a new service
      focused on income security health promotion. The St. Michael's Hospital Academic Family
      Health Team has received ongoing funding from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care
      (MOHLTC) to support this service. The primary outcome is income security, and secondary
      outcomes include quality of life, financial literacy and community integration.

      Population - Adults living in poverty Intervention - Income security health promotion
      Control - Usual care Outcome - Primary: Improvement in income per month. Secondary: quality
      of life, self-rated health, community engagement.
