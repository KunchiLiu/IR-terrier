      This is a Phase 1b/2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter,
      parallel-group study of B-701 plus docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel in the treatment
      of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cell carcinoma in subjects who have relapsed
      after, or are refractory to standard therapy.

      This is a Phase 1b/2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter,
      parallel-group, efficacy and safety study of B-701 plus docetaxel versus placebo plus
      docetaxel in the treatment of subjects with Stage IV, locally advanced or metastatic UCC who
      have relapsed after, or are refractory to at least one prior line of chemotherapy. This
      study is divided into 2 phases: Lead-In Phase and Randomized Phase; and the Lead-In Phase is
      divided into 3 cohorts. In Cohorts 1 and 2, all subjects will receive both B-701 plus
      docetaxel. In Cohort 3, all subjects will receive B-701 only.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide tumor tissue obtained within 18 months of enrollment of suitable quality and
             quantity and to demonstrate FGFR3 positive tumor by IHC. For subjects participating
             in the Randomized Phase only, if suitable archival tissue is unavailable, then a core
             biopsy of tumor tissue (metastatic or primary) must be obtained prior to
             randomization

          -  Stage IV, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial bladder cancer or transitional
             cell carcinoma arising in another location of the urinary tract, including urethra,
             ureter, and renal pelvis

          -  Relapsed after or are refractory to one or two prior lines of chemotherapy which have
             not included a taxane platinum agent, as long as a platinum agent is not
             contraindicated for the subject (i.e., if a platinum agent is contraindicated for a
             subject, the one or two prior regimen need not have included a platinum agent)

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 criteria

          -  â‰¥ 18 years old

          -  ECOG 0 or 1

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Weight &gt; 100kg

          -  Clinically significant comorbid medical conditions or lab abnormalities
