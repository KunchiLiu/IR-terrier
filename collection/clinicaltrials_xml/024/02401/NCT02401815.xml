  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how PLX9486 may affect cancer cells
      with certain mutations in the KIT gene, specifically in patients with types of advanced
      solid tumors including Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST).

      PLX9486 is designed to block KIT gene mutations. These mutations can cause cancer and cancer
      cell growth. By blocking these mutations, the drug may kill the cancer cells with the
      mutation and/or stop the tumor from growing. By combining PLX9486 with PLX3397, the
      investigators hope to block most gene mutations in KIT.
