  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CYP2B6 enzyme metabolizes a growing number of clinically important drugs such as the
      anti-HIV drug efavirenz, but its activity in the liver is highly variable, which may lead to
      failure of therapy or toxicity and unpredictable drug interactions. Genetic and several
      nongenetic factors affect the activity of CYP2B6. The goal of this study is to determine the
      impact of simultaneous autoinhibition/autoinduction and CYP2B6 genetics on CYP2B6 activity,
      efavirenz exposure and efavirenz-mediated drug interactions. The pharmacokinetics and drug
      interactions will be determined on three occasions in a total of 60 healthy volunteers. The
      whole study will have 4 phases. A) Phase 1 (baseline control): using selective probe
      substrates, the baseline activities of CYP2B6 (bupropion), CYP2C8 (montelukast) and OATP1B1
      (rosuvastatin) are determined. B) Phase 2 (inhibition): the metabolism and pharmacokinetics
      of a single 600 mg oral dose of efavirenz) and the activities of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and OATP1B1
      (inhibition) are determined. C) Phase 3 (treatment phase): After completing phase 2,
      subjects take 600 mg/day efavirenz at home for 17 days. C) Phase 4 (induction and
      inhibition): At the end of phase 3, steady state metabolism and pharmacokinetics of
      efavirenz and the activities of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 will be determined. Efavirenz
      serves as a model substrate, inhibitor and inducer of CYP2B6 (and other drug disposition
      proteins). Bupropion 4-hydroxylation is an alternative in vivo probe of CYP2B6 activity and
      will be studied here in addition to the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of efavirenz.

      Schedule of assessment

      PHASE 1 (CONTROL PHASE)

      Phase 1 (day 1 to day 4): baseline (control) activities of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 will
      be measured using selective probe substrates. Eligible subjects will receive simultaneously
      a single 100 mg dose of bupropion (CYP2B6), a single 10 mg dose montelukast (CYP2C8) and a
      single 5 mg dose of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1) by mouth on empty stomach together at least 10
      days before phase 2. Frequent plasma samples will be collected for 72 hours and urine for 48
      hours after dosing. Safety assessment will be made for the first 24 hours. Phase 1 is
      completed after the last blood draw on day 4 (72 hours).

      PHASE 2 (INHIBITION PHASE)

      In phase 2 (days 11 to 16), the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of a single 600 mg oral dose
      efavirenz will be determined along with the activities of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and OATP1B1.
      Subjects receive a single 600 mg oral dose of efavirenz and blood samples will be obtained
      at 30 min and 1 hour. Immediately after the 1 hour blood draw, the three probe drugs (10 mg
      montelukast, 100 mg bupropion, and 5 mg rosuvastatin) will be administered simultaneously.
      Frequent plasma samples will be collected for 120 hours and urine for 48 hours after
      efavirenz dosing. Safety assessment will be made for the first 24 hours. Phase 2 is
      completed after the last blood draw on day 16 (120 hours). Note: The additional time points
      (compared to phase 1) are needed because of the long elimination half-life of efavirenz.

      PHASE 3 (EFAVIRENZ TREATMENT PHASE).

      In phase 3 (days 16 to 32), subjects will take efavirenz (600 mg/day) every evening for 17
      days (Note: Phase 3 starts when the subject takes the first dose that evening on Day 16).
      Prior to taking the evening dose, they will be requested to return to the Indiana Clinical
      Research Center on day 19, day 22, day 25, day 28 and day 31 for a brief outpatient visit to
      have vital signs checked, draw blood sample (~10 ml, approximately 2 teaspoonful), and to
      fill out the brief central nervous system (CNS) symptoms questionnaire. They will be
      reminded not to take the evening dose of efavirenz on these days until after their blood
      draw. Since efavirenz has a long half-life (~76 hours after single dose and ~50 at steady
      state), a total of 17 days of efavirenz treatment is required to achieve steady-state plasma
      concentrations of efavirenz and steady-state autoinduction of metabolism. Subjects will be
      instructed to take efavirenz at bed-time to minimize efavirenz-induced central nervous side
      effects. Minor rescheduling (±3 days) of the subject's fixed inpatient/outpatient visits
      will be allowed including adjusting the amount of study medication (up to 3 doses less or up
      to 3 doses more) to be given prior to the subject's 4th inpatient visit.

      PHASE 4 (INHIBITION/INDUCTION PHASE)

      In phase 4 (days 33 to 38), the steady-state metabolism and pharmacokinetics of efavirenz
      will be determined along the activities of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and OATP1B1. The procedures
      described in phase 2 will be repeated. On day 38, an exit exam will be performed consisting
      of a repeat of a repeat of the screening laboratory tests including blood and urine tests.
      The study diary will be collected. Medication bottles with left over pills (if any) will be
      returned and pills remaining will be counted for compliance purposes. The total duration of
      the study will be 38 days.

    <description>After the samples collection (blood and urine), we will perform the quantification, for each of the time points, of all the drugs and also their metabolites in plasma and urine. The composite of the concentration will be used to calculate the pharmacokinetics parameters clearance and/or metabolic ration for all the drugs in each of the phases (control, inhibition and induction phase) as follow: Clearance [dose/Area under the curve (AUC)], plasma metabolic ratio (AUC metabolite/AUC parent drug) and urine metabolic ratio (amount metabolite/amount parent drug)</description>
