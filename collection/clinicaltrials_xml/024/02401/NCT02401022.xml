    <textblock>
      This is a 19-week, multi-center, randomized, Phase 2 clinical study comparing the efficacy
      of two different doses of AZD8529 (1.5 and 40 mg) in smoking cessation. Up to 2 weeks will
      be allowed for the Screening Period, followed by a 1-week, single-blind run-in period. At
      the end of Study Week 1 (on Study Day 8), medication compliance will be one of the factors
      used in a predictive enrichment strategy.
