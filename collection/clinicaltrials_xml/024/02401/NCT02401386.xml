    <textblock>
      This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Lu Eight Brocades(LEB) on improving quality
      of life in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). Sixty patients with fibromyalgia will be
      enrolled, and will be randomized into 2 groups with a ratio of 1:1 in this study. Thirty
      participants in LEB group will be asked to learn and practice LEB 30 minutes daily for
      12-weeks; while the other 30 participants will be on a waiting list through 12-weeks. Seven
      questionnaires will be measured at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks (end of study),
      and a more 12-weeks follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Lu Eight Brocades(LEB) is a set of Qigong exercises that originated in China and date
      back thousands of years. It is a mind-body practice that combines meditation with slow,
      gentle, graceful movements, as well as deep breathing and relaxation, to move vital energy
      (or qi) throughout the body and is practiced as a rehabilitation exercise for various kinds
      of diseases. It is considered a complex, multicomponent intervention that integrates
      physical, psychosocial, emotional, spiritual, and behavioral elements.

      Fibromyalgia(FM)is a common and complex clinical syndrome characterized by chronic and
      widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and physical and psychological
      impairment. Evidence-based guidelines suggest that exercise is beneficial for FM and has
      been advocated as a core component of its treatment. Because of LEB's mind-body attributes
      and it is easy to learn, we assume that it could be well suited for the treatment of FM.

      Patients enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated into one of two groups: LEB group
      and control group (waiting-list group). Patients will be evaluated at baseline, at 4 weeks,
      at 8 weeks, at 12 weeks, and a more 12-weeks follow-up. Evaluation will be based on quality
      of life, symptoms, standard scales of pain, degree of fatigue, depression, stress and sleep
      quality.All the participants will receive a half-day training, including recognizing
      fibromyalgia, managing chronic pain, dealing with sleep disorder and improving physical and
      mental health.
