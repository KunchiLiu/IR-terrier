      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of
      intravenous (iv) pantoprazole in patients 1 to 16 years old who are candidates for acid
      suppression therapy.

    <textblock>
      In hospitalized pediatric subjects, age 1 to 16 years who in the judgment of the
      investigator are candidates for acid suppression therapy, the following are the objectives
      of this trial:

      Primary Objectives To characterize the PK profile of single and repeated IV doses of
      pantoprazole in pediatric subjects aged 1 &lt; to less than 2 years old.

      To characterize the PK profile of single and repeated IV doses of pantoprazole in pediatric
      subjects aged 2 to 16 years old.

      Secondary Objectives To determine the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses
      of IV pantoprazole in each of the independent age cohorts over 7 days.

      To assess the CYP2C19 genotype in pediatric subjects receiving IV pantoprazole, to determine
      the presence of the gene for the major enzyme responsible for metabolism of pantoprazole.

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject

          -  Use of H2RAs, sucralfate, misoprostol, or prokinetic agents, and bismuth preparations
             within 2 weeks (14 days) before Day 1.
