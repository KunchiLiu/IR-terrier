  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of rectal lubricants can affect
      how well the medication, Truvada, will work to prevent infection with HIV when someone is
      exposed to HIV in the rectum.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV. The
      majority of HIV infections among MSM occur through exposure to the rectal mucosa during
      receptive anal intercourse (RAI). During RAI, many MSM will use lubricants, which can
      potentially cause mucosal inflammation and damage. A new HIV prevention intervention, called
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), recommends that MSM at risk of HIV infection take a daily
      anti-HIV medication called Truvada (tenofovir/emtricitabine) which is highly effective.
      However, it is not known if the use of lubricant during RAI will interfere with the efficacy
      of PrEP for HIV prevention.
