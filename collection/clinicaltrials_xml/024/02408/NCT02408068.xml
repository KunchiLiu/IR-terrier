    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out whether food has an effect on the way the body deals
      with modified release hydrocortisone, and to compare with the pharmacokinetics of immediate
      release hydrocortisone (fasted). This information will be used to help doctors with dosing
      in clinical practice.

      This is a phase I study in healthy male volunteers, who will be given dexamethasone to
      suppress their natural cortisol production. 18 will be consented for the study. They will
      have had a history and a physical examination, blood tests for routine safety, hepatitis C
      and HIV, drug abuse and ECGs. Following the results of these tests and the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study, they will be admitted to the phase I unit on the
      first afternoon (Day -1). They will be given dexamethasone at 22.00hrs that evening, and
      remain in the unit until the end of the period. Each volunteer will be admitted for 3
      periods of approximately 1.5 days, with a washout of 7 days between periods, and they will
      be randomised to either fast and take a single 20mg dose of immediate release
      hydrocortisone, to fast and take a single 20mg dose of the study medication, (a modified
      release hydrocortisone), or to the &quot;fed&quot; group, where they take a single dose of 20mg study
      medication, and have a highly calorific standardised breakfast. The volunteers will have
      cannulae to enable one pre-dose blood sample to be taken followed by 24 hour PK sampling
      (modified release) and 12 hour PK sampling for the immediate release period. After these
      samples have been taken the volunteers will be able to leave the unit. There will be another
      assessment 3 to 5 days after study period 3 with further blood tests, assessment of any
      adverse events etc.

    <description>Volunteers will be admitted, take dexamethasone at 22.00hrs, fast overnight, and receive a high fat, high calorie breakfast on the morning of Day 1. Thirty minutes after the start of the breakfast they will receive 20mg of modified release hydrocortisone with 200 millilitres of water, and no further food for 4 hours, water will be allowed from 1 hour after the food. One baseline pharmacokinetics (PK) sample will be taken starting prior to the dose and then over 24 hours (29 samples).</description>
