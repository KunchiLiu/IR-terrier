  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain has been defined as a subjective experience. Various pain assessment tools, (such as
      NRS) have been developed and validated to objectively monitor and treat pain. There are
      certain patient populations, in whom, the current pain assessment tools cannot be used
      effectively due to communication problems such as cognitively impaired patients. In the US,
      the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has made it
      mandatory to monitor and treat pain. In the absence of reliable pain assessment tools that
      would objectively measure pain, there is also risk of under treatment and overtreatment of
      pain that may lead to negative outcomes. Therefore, a monitor that is able to predict pain
      levels objectively, will help to achieve above goals. The investigators are using Skin
      Conductance Algesimeter (SCA) to measure pain by analyzing changes in skin conductance.
