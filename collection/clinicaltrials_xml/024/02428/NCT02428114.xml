  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with early-stage breast cancer, chemotherapy has substantially improved survival
      rates for breast cancer patients. Improvements in outcomes, however, are compromised by the
      considerable toxicities associated with chemotherapy, most notable being neutropenia.
      Neutropenia is the presence of abnormally few white blood cells, leading to increased
      susceptibility to infection and can require hospitalization and need for intravenous
      antibiotics and is sometimes fatal. Febrile neutropenia can also be associated with
      treatment delays and dose reductions, potentially compromising treatment efficacy. Patients
      can receive medication to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia, such as Neupogen
      (Filgrastim) as a daily injection for 5, 7, or 10 days. Since there is genuine uncertainty
      amongst healthcare professionals as to which administration schedule of Neupogen is better,
      investigators are performing a randomized study in which patients are put into a group by
      chance to give participants one of three standards of Neupogen daily injection. Neupogen can
      cost approximately $200 per injection, so if a physician prescribes 10 days for 8 cycles of
      treatment this can cost $16,000 compared to a 5 day prescription which would cost half this.
      In addition to cost savings, many patients are not able to give themselves injections on a
      daily basis and require nursing resources which are utilized at high-cost. This study will
      use an &quot;integrated consent model&quot; that involves an &quot;oral consent&quot; rather than a written
      informed consenting process in order to increase the number of patients who may participate
      while performing a study at a lower cost. While determining the optimal treatment will
      improve patient comfort and acceptability, using the minimal safe duration of administration
      may also offer cost savings.
