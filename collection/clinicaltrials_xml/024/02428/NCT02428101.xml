    <textblock>
      This study will examine DNA from Gastrointestinal Tract of cancer patients treated with
      oxaliplatin to look for a variation (mutation) of the ABCG2 gene that may lead to
      drug-induced peripheral neuropathy in certain patients.

      The DNA will be extracted from patients' blood samples and are analyzed for the ABCG2
      gene(G34A ,C421A genotypes) and correlated with peripheral neuropathy grades.
