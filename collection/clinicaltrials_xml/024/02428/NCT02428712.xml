             forms of contraception include abstinence, hormonal contraceptive in conjunction with
             a barrier method, or a double barrier method. Women of non-child-bearing potential
             may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been postmenopausal for

             they are asymptomatic and on stable dose (&gt;2 weeks) of steroids or if they do not
             require steroids following successful local therapy.

          -  Dose-escalation Cohorts: Investigational drug use within 28 days (or 5 half-lives,
             whichever is longer) of the first dose of PLX8394

          -  Extension Cohorts: Investigational drug use within 28 days (or 5 half-lives,
             whichever is shorter) of the first dose of PLX8394.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness.

          -  Active secondary malignancy unless the malignancy is not expected to interfere with
             the evaluation of safety and is approved by the Medical Monitor. Examples of the
             latter include basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in-situ carcinoma of the
             cervix, and isolated elevation of prostate-specific antigen. Patients with a
             completely treated prior malignancy and no evidence of disease for ≥ 2 years are
             eligible.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, external biliary shunt, or significant
             bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption.

          -  Baseline mean QT interval corrected using Fridericia's equation (QTcF) ≥ 450 msec
             (males) or ≥ 470 msec (females).

          -  Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias including bradyarrhythmias and/or patients
             who require anti-arrhythmic therapy (excluding beta blockers or digoxin). Patients
             with controlled atrial fibrillation are not excluded.

          -  Congenital long QT syndrome or patients taking concomitant medications known to
             prolong the QT interval (e.g., tricyclics, azithromycin, methadome).

             York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2. Patient must not have unstable angina (angina
             symptoms at rest) or new-onset angina within the last 3 months or myocardial
             infarction within the past 6 months.

          -  Women who are breast-feeding or pregnant.

          -  Known chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), or
             Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

          -  Imprisonment or under legal guardianship.

          -  The presence of a medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, makes the patient inappropriate for study inclusion.
