      The aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of the influenza vaccine in individuals
      with major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as to elucidate the nature of the immunological
      abnormalities in MDD using a quasi-experimental design. Specifically, the investigators plan
      to induce transient, mild inflammation in medically-healthy study participants using the
      influenza vaccine. Initially the investigators will conduct a pilot project with up to 20
      individuals in order to evaluate the time-point at which the peak inflammatory response to
      the vaccine occurs. Subjects will receive the seasonal influenza vaccine and provide blood
      samples 4 hours, 2 days, and 30 days post vaccination. Subsequent to the pilot study, both
      depressed and psychiatrically-healthy participants will be randomized in a parallel group,
      double-blind design so that they receive either influenza vaccine (seasonal vaccine) or
      saline (i.m). At baseline, subjects will provide a blood sample, complete a number of rating
      scales to measure mood and fatigue, and may complete approximately one hour of MRI scanning
      with or without simultaneous EEG recording. Two-days post vaccination, they will provide a
      second blood sample, complete more clinical ratings and may complete another identical MRI
      session with or without simultaneous EEG. Four weeks later, participants will be asked to
      return to provide a third blood sample and complete additional clinical ratings. The blood
      samples will be used to measure both innate and adaptive immune function and may be used to
      correlate the vaccine-induced immunological changes to neurophysiological changes in the
      brain measured by MRI and/or EEG.

      Psychological stress has been shown to impair the efficacy of the influenza vaccine,
      particularly in older individuals (&gt; 60 years). However, the effect of depression (as
      opposed to stress per se) on vaccine response has not been measured, especially in younger
      people. One possible cause of this putative impaired vaccine response is suppression of the
      immune system in a subgroup of individuals with depression. Major depressive disorder (MDD)
      has been associated with a decline in total numbers of circulating B-cells, T-cells, and
      natural killer cells (NKC), a reduction in the proliferative responses of NKC and T-cells in
      vitro that is ameliorated by administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs), increased susceptibility to various viral infections, and a decline in the efficacy
      of the herpes zoster vaccine in the elderly (1, 2). On the other hand, MDD appears also to
      be characterized by immunological abnormalities that manifest both as low-grade
      inflammation, including over-activity of the innate immune system (3). Whether inflammation
      and immune suppression are two different manifestations of the same underlying abnormality
      (unitary model) or whether inflammation and immune suppression are distinct phenomena
      occurring in different MDD subtypes (independent model) is not known.

      MDD is also characterized by neurophysiological abnormalities of striatal, cortical midline,
      and limbic brain structures that regulate hormonal, autonomic, and emotional responses to
      reward and stress (4-6). Yet, it remains unclear how immune function relates to these
      depression-associated functional neuroimaging abnormalities. Studies of healthy volunteers
      (HCs) administered endotoxin or the typhoid vaccine have reported inflammation-associated
      increases in negative affect along with neurophysiological changes in brain regions
      comprising the affective and reward circuitry (7-8). However, because these studies were
      limited to HCs, it is possible that the observed inflammation-induced neurophysiological
      changes were adaptive and therefore not applicable to MDD populations. That is, it remains
      unclear whether any experimentally-induced immune abnormalities in MDD are correlated and
      therefore potentially causally-related to the neuroimaging abnormalities observed in MDD.

      In order to address these questions, we use a parallel group, placebo-controlled influenza
      vaccine challenge to induce transient inflammation that peaks 2-days post vaccination in MDD
      subjects and HCs. Subjects may complete a pre-and-post vaccination MRI scan, the latter
      during the peak inflammatory response.

      Aim 1: To examine whether influenza vaccine effectiveness is compromised in a
      young-to-middle-aged sample (18-55 years of age) of individuals with MDD.

      Hypothesis 1.1. Compared with HCs (n=40), individuals with MDD (n=40) will display reduced
      vaccine titers and reduced influenza virus-induced CD4+ memory T-cell proliferation four
      weeks post vaccination (T2).

      Hypothesis 1.2. A greater number of MDD subjects than HCs will fail to show a four-fold
      increase in antibody titer, the conventional standard for determining a clinically
      significant response to a viral vaccine.

      Aim 2: To test the competing models of immune dysfunction in MDD.

      Hypothesis 2.1. At T0 and T1, stimulated and unstimulated monocytes from MDD subjects will
      show increased interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production compared with
      HCs. The effect will be most salient at T1 in individuals receiving vaccine.

      Hypothesis 2.2. Consistent with the unitary model, monocyte IL-6 and/or TNF production at T0
      and T1 will be inversely correlated with antibody titers at T2 in the MDD group.

      Aim 3: To test for neurophysiological differences between MDD patients and HCs in resting
      state cerebral blood flow (with arterial spin labeling), resting EEG activity, and BOLD
      response to monetary rewards and interoceptive stimuli (with fMRI) at T0 and T1, and to
      correlate depression-associated perfusion, EEG activity, reward response, and interoceptive
      function with immune function at T0 and T1.

      Hypothesis 3.1: Compared with HCs, the MDD subjects will display reduced perfusion of the
      subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and/or pregenual ACC (pgACC), hemispheric
      asymmetry in the alpha (8-13 Hz) power band (left prefrontal cortex hypoactivation), as well
      as reduced hemodynamic response to anticipatory reward in the ventral striatum. These
      differences will be most salient at T1 in the MDD group receiving vaccine versus the HCs
      receiving vaccine.

      Hypothesis 3.2: The functional imaging abnormalities in the MDD group at T0 and/or T1 will
      be correlated with the abnormalities in monocyte activation in the MDD group at T0 and/or
      T1.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Major Depressive Disorder Patient Group - Currently Depressed: Subjects will have met
        Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V) criteria
        for primary MDD in a current major depressive episode and current Hamilton Depression
        Rating Scale (HAM-D) or Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score in the
        mild-to-severely depressed range and will have been deemed to be medically stable by a
        physician listed on this protocol. Subjects who do not wish to receive treatment with
        psychotropic medication in the future and have not taken psychotropic medication for at
        least 3 weeks will be included in the study.

        Healthy Comparison Group: Subjects will be selected who have not met criteria for any Axis
        I psychiatric disorder, have no known first-degree relatives with mood or anxiety
        disorders, and have a current score on the HAM-D or MADRS in the non-depressed range.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Inability to provide informed consent, pregnant or nursing women, known hypersensitivity
        to vaccines, age of onset of MDD &gt; 40 years, metal implants or other factors that would
        preclude MRI scanning, serious risk of suicide, delusions or hallucinations, medical or
        neurological illnesses (such as diabetes, autoimmune disorders or inflammatory bowel
        disease) that affect brain structure, function or immune measurements, previous head
        injury with loss of consciousness, abuse of drugs or alcohol within the previous year or a
        lifetime history of substance dependence, treatment with medications that impact immune
        function (e.g. prednisone), HIV or other chronic infection, a recent acute illness (e.g.
        influenza), receipt of a vaccine within 3 months of commencing the study. Subjects whose
        first major depressive episodes arose temporally after other major medical or psychiatric
        conditions will also be excluded, since their functional imaging results generally differ
        from those reported in primary MDD.

        Subjects will be asked not to take any over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
        drugs or drink alcohol for 48 hr. before each study day. The use of oral contraceptives
        and menstrual phase or status are not exclusion criteria but this information will be
        recorded. The same exclusion criteria apply to healthy controls with the added criterion
        that first-degree relatives should be free of major psychiatric illness as assessed with
        the Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS).
