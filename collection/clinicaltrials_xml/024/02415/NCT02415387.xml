    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial uses a typhoid vaccine to cause an immune response in
      patients with stage I-IIIA breast cancer who received chemotherapy and studies whether
      patients' fitness levels affect how well their bodies handle a challenge to their immune
      system. A vaccine is a substance or group of substances meant to cause the immune system to
      respond to a tumor or to microorganisms such as bacteria or viruses. Immune responses may
      cause excess inflammation in the body and behavioral changes, such as depression, fatigue,
      pain, and problems with thinking and reasoning. Studying immune responses in patients with
      breast cancer who have undergone chemotherapy may help doctors learn whether physical
      fitness can protect the body from effects of immune system stress and whether it may be able
      to reduce health problems in patients with breast cancer who have undergone chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the relationships between cardiorespiratory fitness and inflammatory and
      behavioral responses (negative mood, fatigue, pain, and cognitive problems) to typhoid
      vaccine.

      II. To determine the effects of age and depressive symptoms on inflammatory and behavioral
      responses to typhoid vaccine and placebo.

      III. To assess the ability of cardiorespiratory fitness to moderate age- and
      depression-related responses to typhoid vaccine.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive typhoid vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at visit 1 followed by placebo
      IM 14-30 days later at visit 2.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IM at visit 1 followed by typhoid vaccine IM 14-30 days
      later at visit 2.

      During each visit, patients in both arms complete an audio-recorded questionnaire that
      includes questions about mood, feelings, health behaviors, health, and personality. Patients
      also complete cognitive tasks at 3-4.5 hours post-injection and receive a cold tolerance
      test following the post-injection assessment.
