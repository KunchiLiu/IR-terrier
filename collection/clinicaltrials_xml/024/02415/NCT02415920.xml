  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether oxytocin, a neuropeptide known for its role in social
      bonding, influences the outcomes of persuasive communications. Participants will be given
      either oxytocin or a placebo. Then, participants will view several videos discussing
      opinions that they agree and/or disagree with. Participants' physiological and psychological
      responses to the videos in the different conditions will be compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin is a naturally occurring hormone, commonly known for its role in social approach,
      bonding, and trust.. The present study is designed to investigate whether and how oxytocin
      may affect communication outcomes--specifically, by influencing patterns of eye contact and
      other non-verbal behaviors. Gaze patterns play an important role in perceptions of a
      speaker's likeability, competence, and persuasiveness, and oxytocin has been found to
      increase gazing at the eye region.

      Healthy adult volunteers will intranasally administer either 24 IU of oxytocin or a placebo
      (saline) solution. Participants will then view videos of speakers presenting opinions on
      various socio-political issues which the participants either agree or disagree with.
      Patterns of non-verbal behavior and physiological reactions (e.g., eye contact, changes in
      heart rate and cortisol) will be assessed during the procedure. Participants will also
      complete questions about their psychological reactions (e.g., anger, receptiveness) to the
      opinions presented in the videos.

    <description>Participants will answer a series of questions regarding their reactions (e.g., anger, receptiveness) to the speakers and the opinions presented in the videos. Participants' physiological reactions (e.g., heart rate, cortisol levels, patterns of eye contact) will also be assessed. It is expected that participants in the oxytocin and placebo conditions will differ in their psychological and physiological reactions to the speakers and information presented.</description>
