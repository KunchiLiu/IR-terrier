  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 3 randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ACTIMMUNE® (interferon-γ 1b) in the treatment of
      Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of
      ACTIMMUNE® in FA patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 90 subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive SC doses of either ACTIMMUNE® TIW or matching placebo TIW for a total
      of 26 weeks; the study drug dose (or corresponding volume of placebo) is planned to be
      escalated on a weekly basis over the first four weeks of treatment (from 10 μg/m² to 25, 50,
      and 100 μg/m² or equivalent volumes of placebo). The dose may be reduced, interrupted, or
      held based on tolerability.

    <description>Nine areas of activities of daily living (ADL) will be evaluated. These areas include: (speech, swallowing, cutting food and handling utensils, dressing, personal hygiene, falling, walking, quality of sitting position, and bladder function) on a 5-point scale (0=normal, 4=greatest loss of function) with allowable increments of 0.5 if the subject or caregiver strongly feels that a task falls between two scores.

    <description>Approximately 40 patients will remain confined overnight at week 4 for serial blood collections at pre-dose (approximately 30-60 minutes prior to dosing), 1-1.5 hours, 3-4 hours, 5-6 hours, 8-10 hours, 12-15 hours, 16-18 hours, and 22-24 hours after study drug administration for the determination of maximum concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). All patients will contribute a single blood sample at weeks 13 and 26 for population PK analysis.</description>

    <description>Approximately 45 subjects will receive subcutaneous (SC) doses of ACTIMMUNE® three times a week (TIW) for a total of 26 weeks. The study drug dose is planned to be escalated on a weekly basis over the first 4 weeks of treatment (from 10 µg/m² to 25, 50, and 100 µg/m²). The dose may be reduced, interrupted, or held based on tolerability. By week 13, all subjects are to be on a stable tolerated dose of study drug in order to continue study participation; the dose may not be further increased after week 13, however, it may be reduced on a case-by-case basis to manage drug-related AEs.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent and child assent, if applicable.

          -  FA confirmed by genetic testing with two expanded guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA)
             repeats.

          -  FA functional stage of &gt;1 to &lt;5 and ability to walk 25 feet with or without an
             assistive device.

          -  Male or female subject between the ages of 10 and 25 years, inclusive.

          -  If female, the subject is not pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant
             during the study, or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Female
             subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result
             at Screening, a negative urine pregnancy test result at Baseline, and agree to use a
             reliable method of contraception throughout the study and for 30 days after the last
             dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any unstable illness that in the investigator's opinion precludes participation in
             the study.

          -  Use of any investigational product within 30 days prior to randomization.

          -  A history of substance abuse.

          -  Presence of clinically significant cardiac disease (as determined by the investigator
             based on electrocardiogram [ECG] and echocardiogram results at Screening).
             Specifically, an ejection fraction of &lt;40% or a prolonged QT interval (&gt;50% of cycle
             duration) will result in exclusion. If the investigator notes any other clinically
             significant abnormalities on the ECG or echocardiogram, the subject may be eligible
             if they are provided clearance from a cardiologist.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to IFN-ɣ or E. coli-derived products.

          -  Presence of moderate or severe renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;50
             mL/min) or hepatic disease (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] or alanine
             aminotransferase [ALT] &gt;2x the upper limit of normal) as evidenced by laboratory
             results at Screening.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, or platelet count
             as evidenced by laboratory test results at Screening.
