    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic
             tumor for which no effective standard therapy is available.

          2. Subjects with previously treated brain metastasis (es) that is asymptomatic or
             radiographically/clinically stable and not requiring steroids medications for 4 weeks
             prior to enrollment are permitted.

          3. Subjects must have archival tumor tissues or agree to a tumor biopsy for analysis of
             predictive biomarkers such as PD-L1. (Fresh tumor biopsies are strongly recommended
             at baseline for biomarker analysis in subjects with readily accessible tumor lesions
             and who consent to the biopsies.)

          4. Subjects must have measurable disease as defined per RECIST Version 1.1.

          5. Male or female and ≥18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1.

          7. Subjects must have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory
             values.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mL

               -  Platelets ≥100,000 / mL

               -  Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L- without qualifications

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for patients with liver
                  metastases

               -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN

               -  Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN

          8. Subjects have voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent.

          9. Female subjects are eligible to enter and participate in the study if they

               -  Non childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming
                  pregnant), including any female who

                    -  Has had a hysterectomy.

                    -  Has had a bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy).

                    -  Has had a bilateral tubal ligation.

                    -  Is post menopausal (total cessation of menses for ≥1 year).

               -  Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within
                  7 days of the first investigational product administration), and uses adequate
                  contraception before study entry and throughout the study until 90 days after
                  the last investigational product administration. Adequate contraception, when
                  used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the
                  instructions of the physician, are defined as follows:

                    -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and
                       is the sole sexual partner for that female.

                    -  Any intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per
                       year.

                    -  Double barrier contraception defined as condom with spermicidal jelly,
                       foam, suppository, or film; OR diaphragm with spermicide; OR male condom
                       and diaphragm.

                    -  Not be breast feeding.

         10. Male subjects are eligible to enter and participate in the study if they are
             vasectomized or agree to the use of contraception during the study treatment period
             and for at least 180 days after the last dose of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other mAbs.

          2. Prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for tumor for which a
             patient is enrolled in the study, and locally curable cancers that have been
             apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder
             cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast.

          3. Prior therapies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1.

          4. Subjects who fail to meet enrollment criteria for other PD-1 or PD-L1 trials solely
             due to low or negative predictive biomarkers.

          5. Subjects with active autoimmune diseases or history of autoimmune diseases should be
             excluded.

          6. Subjects should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment
             with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration.

          7. Has history of interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis except for
             those induced by radiation therapies..

          8. Known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus;

          9. Active infection requiring therapy, positive tests for Hepatitis B surface antigen or
             Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA);

         10. Underlying medical conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, will make the
             administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of toxicity
             determination or adverse events;

         11. Prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or any investigational therapies used
             to control cancer must have been completed at least 4 weeks or at least 5 half-lives
             (whichever is shorter) before study drug administration, and all adverse events have
             either returned to baseline or stabilized.

         12. Use of any vaccines against infectious diseases (e.g., influenza, varicella, etc.)
             within 4 weeks (28 days) of initiation of study therapy and 60 days after the last
             administration of the study medication.
