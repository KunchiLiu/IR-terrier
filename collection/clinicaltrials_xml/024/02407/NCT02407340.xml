    <textblock>
      This study will examine the utility of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) as a potential new
      medication for the treatment of Alcohol use disorder (AUD). Non-treatment seeking men and
      women with AUD will be enrolled in a double blind placebo controlled phase I clinical trial.
      Participants will complete an 7-day inpatient protocol. During the first 3 days of the
      inpatient protocol, participants will complete alcohol abstinence in which withdrawal
      symptoms are measured,and urine will be collected to determine withdrawal symptom severity
      and urine levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Participants will then complete 3
      laboratory procedures which measure 1) stress response, 2) motivation to drink alcohol and
      3) subjective and physiological effects of alcohol. Finally, because participants are
      individuals with AUD, we will administer a brief intervention to address their risky alcohol
      drinking and problems before discharge.

      This study will lay the necessary groundwork for future comprehensive research to examine
      the utility of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) as a potential new medication for the
      treatment of Alcohol use disorder (AUD). OT modulates a number of key systems involved in
      addiction processes, including dopamine (DA) mesolimbic reward circuitry, and
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) stress
      systems, and has low abuse liability. Our overarching hypothesis is that OT will attenuate
      several measures thought to drive compulsive alcohol drinking and relapse. Specifically, we
      will examine whether OT decreases acute stress responses, alleviates alcohol withdrawal
      symptoms, reduces craving and motivation to drink, and decreases alcohol
      self-administration. Since interactions with alcohol are an important focus of our study, we
      will enroll non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers with AUD in a double blind, placebo
      controlled inpatient protocol. Subjects will be randomized to receive intranasal OT (40
      IU/dose) or placebo 3 times daily. Participants will complete alcohol detoxification; we
      will measure alcohol withdrawal symptoms, craving, and 24-hr urinary free CORT. Participants
      will then complete 3 laboratory procedures in fixed order. The Trier Social Stress Test
      (TSST) which includes public speaking and performance of mental arithmetic will be used to
      examine subjective and physiological stress responses. An alcohol motivated responding (AMR)
      procedure will be used to examine subjects' responding to earn either drinks or money. A
      cumulative alcohol-dosing (CAD) procedure will be used to examine physiological and
      subjective responses across several blood alcohol levels. CORT levels will also be assessed.
      This study will provide new information on OT efficacy across a range of different measures
      predictive of alcohol use and misuse, and, if OT shows efficacy, help clarify the mechanism
      of OT action.
