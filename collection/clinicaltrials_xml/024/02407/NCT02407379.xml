      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of photoablative and photodynamic diode
      laser in adjunct to scaling-root planing (PAPD+SRP) and SRP alone for the treatment of
      periodontitis.

      The present study is a randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial, which used a
      split-mouth design. All patients were informed individually about the nature of the proposed
      treatment, and informed consent forms were signed. Twenty-four patients were studied.
      Maxillary left or right quadrants were randomly assigned to PAPD laser treatment or
      sham-treatment and SRP. PAPD consisted of: i) photoablative gingival epithelium with diode
      laser (λ 810 nm, 1 W); ii) photodynamic treatments (4-10 weekly) with diode laser (λ 635 nm,
      100 mW) and 0.3% methylene blue as photoactive antiseptic, performed after SRP.
      Sham-treatment was similar but with switched off laser.

      Efficacy evaluations, including probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL),
      bleeding on probing (BOP) was performed at baseline ,1year, and year 3 using a conventional
      manual periodontal probe. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), erythrocytes (RBC), damaged
      epithelial cells (DEC) and bacteria were assayed by cytofluorescence on gingival exfoliative
      samples at baseline, 6 month and 1, 3, 5 years.

    <description>Photoablative gingival epithelium was performed with at 810 nm diode laser‖ (1 W output power, continuous wave mode, 66.7 J/cm2, a 0.6 mm optical fiber). SRP was performed using curettes¶The periodontal tissues and the dental root, were rinsed with the photosensitizer agent methylene blue (0.3% w/v in water). After 5 min., the treated areas were irradiated with at 635 nm diode laser (100 mW output power, continuous wave mode, 0.6 mm optic fiber). The photodynamic treatment was repeated once weekly until normalization of the cytodiagnostic parameters (range: 4-10 applications). Sham-treatment was similar but with switched off laser</description>
