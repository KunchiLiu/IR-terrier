    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer hospitalized for an acute medical illness have an increased risk of
      venous thromboembolic events. Although international guidelines suggest the use of
      thromboprophylaxis in these patients, the recommendations are based on studies which
      included a percentage of patients with cancer without primarily focusing on this high risk
      group.

      Since patients with cancer present an increased risk of bleeding complications it is
      critical to evaluate the safety of thromboprophylaxis in the cancer group. Recent studies
      suggest a limited use of thromboprophylaxis in these patients.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the use, efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in
      medical cancer patients hospitalized for an acute medical disease.

      Design: observational, prospective study Primary end-point: incidence of major and
      clinically relevant non major bleeding during hospitalization Secondary endpoints: frequency
      of use, doses and contraindications for pharmacological thromboprophylaxis; venous
      thromboembolic events up to three months after discharge
