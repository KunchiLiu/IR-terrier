    <textblock>
      Some of the liver transplantation recipients experience postoperative acute kidney injury
      due to various causes including genetic factors. Prevention of postoperative acute kidney
      injury is essential for postoperative care in liver transplantation recipients. The aim of
      this study is to investigate the relationship between gene polymorphisms which have been
      known to be associated with postoperative acute kidney injury, and the occurrence of acute
      kidney injury after liver transplantation.

    <description>The development of acute kidney injury is defined by the following definition: 50% increase in SCr from the baseline (preoperative value) or a 0.3 mg/dl increase from baseline within 48 h without urine output. The development of acute kidney injury after liver transplantation could correlate with gene polymorphisms, which have been known to be associated with postoperative acute kidney injury.</description>

    <description>Patients undergoing liver transplantation will be included and followed up during the first 72 hours post-liver transplantation in order to confirm the development of acute kidney injury. The patients will be divided into two groups (AKI group vs. non-AKI group) according to the development of acute kidney injury.</description>
