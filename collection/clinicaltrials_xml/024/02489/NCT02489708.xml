      This two phase study will develop and evaluate a Pediatric Emergency Department (PED)
      Decision Support System (DSS)-Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System to facilitate the
      identification of smokers and the delivery of a Second Hand Smoke (SHSe) exposure
      intervention to caregivers who bring their child to the PED.

      The study will be the first to develop and evaluate a Pediatric Emergency Department (PED)
      Decision Support System (DSS)-Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System to facilitate the
      identification of smokers and the delivery of a Second Hand Smoke (SHSe) exposure
      intervention to caregivers who bring their child to the PED. The investigators will conduct
      a two-phased project to develop, refine, and integrate a Decision Support System into the
      current electronic medical record system. In Phase I, the investigators will develop a
      three-part DSS with prompts to: 1) ASK about child SHSe and caregiver smoking 2) Use a
      software program (REDCap) to ADVISE caregivers to reduce their child's SHSe via total
      smoking home and car bans and quitting smoking, and 3) ASSIST caregivers to quit by directly
      connecting them to their choice of free cessation resources (e.g., Quitline, txt2quit,
      smokefree.gov) during the PED visit. If the investigators discover that a teen participant
      is a smoker, the investigators will provide them with resources for the Quitline, tx2quit,
      and teen.smokefree.gov. The investigators will create reports to provide feedback to nurses
      on their SHSe counseling behaviors. Nurses will provide input on program content, functions,
      and design. In Phase II, the investigators will conduct a 3-month feasibility trial to test
      the results of implementing the DSS on changes in nurse SHSe-related behaviors, and child
      and caregiver outcomes.
