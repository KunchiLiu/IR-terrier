  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 2 decades scientists have been studying the effect on brain function from meditation
      practices. The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of a meditation retreat
      program on serotonin and dopamine transporter binding and changes in cerebral blood flow.
      The retreat program that will be followed is a weeklong retreat called the Ignatian Retreat.

      This study will utilize DaTscan single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy subjects within one month of
      entering the retreat. The study uses DaTscan to measure the effect on serotonin and dopamine
      transporter binding, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the effect
      on cerebral blood flow. The Ignatian Retreat is a weeklong retreat which involves meditation
      and prayer.

      Additionally, study participants will complete a variety of questionnaires and scales to
      measure psychological and spirituality states. The scans and questionnaires will be
      completed before and after the participant has completed the retreat. The ultimate goal of
      the study is to analyze and compare pre and post imaging and neuropsychological and
      spirituality changes in healthy controls who participate in this retreat.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to give informed consent and willing to complete the study.

          -  Willing to undergo the full imaging procedures.

          -  Women of childbearing potential with a negative serum pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any neurological or psychiatric disorders, including drug or alcohol abuse, that may
             interfere with cerebral blood flow as determined by the principal investigator.

          -  Any medical conditions that may interfere with cerebral blood flow as determined by
             the principal investigator.

          -  Currently taking medication that might affect cerebral blood flow (i.e.
             antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, benzodiazepines, sedatives, antiseizure
             medications)

          -  Subject is unable or unwilling to lie still in the scanner (i.e. due to
             claustrophobia or weight &gt; 350 pounds)

          -  Subject has metal in their body or other reason that they cannot undergo magnetic
             resonance imaging.

          -  Previous brain surgery or intracranial abnormalities they may complicate
             interpretation of the brain scans. (e.g. stroke, tumor, vascular abnormality).

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Allergy to iodine or shellfish.

          -  Concurrent participation in another research protocol that might affect the outcome
             of this study as determined by the principle Investigator.
