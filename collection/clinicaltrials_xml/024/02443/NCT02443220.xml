    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical study to
      evaluate the antalgic effects between regional or distant combination of acupoints
      stimulated with electroacupuncture on patients undergoing Off-Pump Coronary-Artery Bypass
      Grafting(OP-CABG).This clinical trial is to investigate whether electroacupuncture(EA)
      anesthesia can reduce analgesic in OP-CABG surgery in distant group.The origins of
      therapeutic acupuncture can be traced back at least 2,500 years in China. There has been an
      explosion of interest in Western medicine within the United States and Europe in application
      of acupuncture technique. Acupuncture enjoys worldwide acceptance for treating diseases such
      as migraine, chronic low back pain, and knee osteoarthritis. In 2002, WHO recommended 107
      symptoms, syndromes, and diseases definitively shown to be effectively treated by
      acupuncture. Coronary heart disease (angina pectoris) is among these pathologies. A recent
      clinical trial demonstrated an acupuncture-assisted anesthesia strategy reduces
      postoperative morbidity and medical costs in open-heart surgery under cardiopulmonary
      bypass. Previous researches in animal models have demonstrated that electroacupuncture
      pretreatment protects the heart from ischemic injury. The investigators observed that
      electroacupuncture pretreatment (EAP, 30-minute electric stimulation through 4 electrodes
      attached to the bilateral forearm acupoints) before surgery significantly attenuated serum
      troponin levels during and shortly post-surgery in adult heart valve replacement patients
      and children undergoing cardiac surgery correcting congenital heart malformation.However,
      whether electroacupuncture anesthesia may reduce analgesic in OP-CABG surgery,especially in
      different combination of acupoints,has never been previously investigated.

      The anesthesia will be performed in a standard way. The proposal and sufentanil will be
      infused in target-controlled infusion mode. The dosage of analgesic will be assessed by the
      consumption of sufentanil in the &quot;ug/kg/min&quot; way. And the electroacupuncture anesthesia will
      be implemented by a device named &quot;Hua Tuo&quot; electronic acupuncture treatment instrument.
