    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood after single dose</description>

        identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
        pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

                  plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study medication (whichever
             is longer).

          -  Screening supine blood pressure &gt;= 140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic),
             following at least 5 minutes of rest. If BP is &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg
             (diastolic), repeat per local standard operating procedures (SOP). If orthostatic
             changes are present and deemed to be clinically significant by the investigator,
             Subject can be excluded.
