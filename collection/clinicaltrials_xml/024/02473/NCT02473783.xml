      Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the relationship between improvement of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
           (HAMD) score and basal SERT availability (binding potential) for the prognosis of MDD
           subjects being treated with Sertraline HCl

        2. To evaluate the SERT availability by means of I-123-ADAM SPECT imaging study for
           assisting in detecting MDD

        3. To evaluate the relationship between basal HAMD score and basal SERT availability for
           MDD subjects

        4. To evaluate the relationship between basal HAMD somatic subscale score and basal SERT
           availability for MDD subjects

        5. To evaluate the relationship between change of SERT availability and change of HAMD
           score for MDD patients being treated with Sertraline HCl

      Background:

      Serotonin transporter (SERT) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric
      disorders such as anxiety and depression and is the primary target of the selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which are posited to exert their effect in treating
      psychiatric disorders aforementioned by this mechanism. I-123-ADAM is a selective
      radioligand for imaging SERT using SPECT. Research showed that it displayed an extremely
      high binding affinity to SERT sites. Previous literature also suggested the potential role
      of I-123-ADAM SPECT as useful in understanding how serotonin system affected depression.
      This study aims to evaluate the SERT availability by means of I-123-ADAM SPECT imaging study
      in drug-free subjects for prognosing MDD treatment and assisting in detecting MDD.

      Methods:

      We enrolled patients who had major depressive disorder but was free from prior
      antidepressant medication for at least 5 times of elimination half-lives and healthy
      controls. The patients with major depressive disorder (N=28) received I-123-ADAM SPECT
      before and after the pharmacological intervention with Sertraline HCl for a treatment period
      of six weeks. All healthy subjects (N=27) had only basal I-123-ADAM SPECT. The relationship
      between improvement of depressive symptoms and basal SERT availability for the prognosis of
      MDD subjects being treated with Sertraline HCl will be analyzed. In addition, the
      association between the efficacy of treatment with Sertraline HCl and the change of SERT
      availability will also be investigated. The control group were selected in order to
      distinguish the difference of basal SERT binding potential of I-123-ADAM between healthy and
      MDD subjects.

    <description>The subjects with major depressive disorder who are screened into this study were scheduled for T1-weighted MRI (MRI examination results within 6 months before study are acceptable) prior to the visit of SPECT scans to confirm the absence of organic lesion in the brain and to co-register with SPECT images for the delineation of brain anatomical locations. After the screening visit, eligible subjects received I-123-ADAM SPECT before and after the pharmacological intervention with Sertraline HCl for a treatment period of six weeks. The subjects were observed until no clinically significant adverse events at the drug administration visits before being dismissed.</description>
