  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a protocol that assesses patients' daily fluid
      intake and output can decrease the overall amount of fluid patients receive during the first
      five days in the ICU. The study will also determine if decreasing overall fluids can
      decrease adverse events associated with mechanical ventilation, such as
      ventilator-associated pneumonias.

      The protocol will include daily ultrasounds and blood draws to evaluate fluid balance.
      Ultrasound will be used to measure changes in the diameter of the inferior vena cava with
      respiration.

    <description>Patients in the fluid minimization arm will have daily fluid intake and output, baseline central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, central venous oxygen saturation, pulse pressure variation, and inferior vena cava diameters during inspiration and expiration recorded by a dedicated research fellow. Patients who are intubated will also have corrected flow time, stroke volume, cardiac output, and cardiac index recorded via CardioQ. A fluid challenge in the form of a leg raise or infusion of 250 mL of crystalloid over 5 minutes will then be performed and the parameters repeated. The patient will be judged to be fluid responsive or nonresponsive based on the changes in the parameters. Fluid nonresponsive patients will receive the intervention of the fluid minimization protocol by concentrating continuous infusions, discontinuing maintenance fluids, and minimizing carrier fluids. Diuretics and/or ultrafiltration will be utilized to maintain an even to negative fluid balance.</description>
