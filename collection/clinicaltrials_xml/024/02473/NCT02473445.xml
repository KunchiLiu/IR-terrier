      A long-term extension study of patients with mitochondrial diseases, who are ≥ 6 years old
      and &lt; 18 years previously enrolled into the RP103-MITO-001 (NCT02023866) study assessing the
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of RP103.

    <textblock>
      Patients with either documented genetically confirmed diagnosis of inherited mitochondrial
      diseases, who are ≥ 6 years old and &lt; 18 years, and meet other specified inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, will be included in this study.

      Patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases associated with nuclear or mitochondrial DNA
      mutations that impair the respiratory chain. These include, but are not limited to the
      following clinical syndromes: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy; myoclonic epilepsy and
      ragged-red fibers (MERFF); mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like
      syndrome (MELAS); Kearn-Sayre syndrome; subacute necrotizing encephalopathy (Leigh
      Syndrome); POLG-related disorders (Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome, Autosomal Dominant
      Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia, Autosomal Recessive Progressive External
      Ophthalmoplegia, Childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum Disorders, Myoclonic Epilepsy
      Myopathy Sensory Ataxia, POLG-Related Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders); Mitochondrial
      neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE), also called myoneurogastrointestinal
      encephalopathy syndrome or POLIP syndrome; others, e.g., mitochondrial cardiomyopathies and
      other syndromes due to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions.

      Patients completing the RP103-MITO-001(NCT02023866) study are eligible for enrollment into
      the extension study RP103-MITO-002 if all inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled.
      Subjects continue on the last total daily dose of RP103 taken during RP103-MITO-001.
      Dose-adjustments are permitted.The sample size is maximally 25 subjects.
