      Study the influence of transfusion related Patient Blood Management Program actions on
      transfusion-related outcome measures and cost.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the University Hospital of Zurich, an in-house designed monitoring and feedback system
      was introduced which electronically registers each transfusion of any allogeneic blood
      product, be it red blood cells, plasma or platelets as well as corresponding laboratory
      data. Results are reported quarterly to Department heads. The investigator analyzes whether
      the introduction of this monitoring and feedback system as part of a patient blood
      management Program has a significant influence on use of allogeneic blood product
      transfusions and transfusion-related costs, without compromising patient outcome.
