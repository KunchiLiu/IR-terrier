      A Phase 1b/2a, Multi-Center, Open-Label, 2-Period, Fixed-Sequence Study Evaluating the

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2a, randomized, multi-center, open-label study. Twenty otherwise healthy
      subjects with functioning ileostomies who are between the ages of 18 and 70 years,
      inclusive, will be enrolled. The entire duration of the study may be up to 63 days (from
      Screening to the end-of-study [EOS] visit).

    <description>There will be 2 in-house treatment periods: in Treatment Period 1, subjects will receive 2 oral doses of 150 mg SYN-004 (two 75 mg capsules) and 1g ceftriaxone, and in Treatment Period 2, subjects will receive 2 oral doses of 150mg SYN-004 (two 75 mg capsules) and 1g ceftriaxone in the presence of steady-state esomeprazole; Treatment Periods 1 and 2 will be separated by a 5- to 7-day run-in phase, during which subjects will self-administer 40 mg of esomeprazole once daily (QD) in the morning, at home.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a functioning ileostomy that has been in place for ≥ 3 months.

          -  The subject is male or female between the ages of 18 and 70 years, inclusive.

          -  Other than a functioning ileostomy, the subject is free from clinically significant
             illnesses or disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have active hepatic, small intestine, or biliary tract disease.

          -  Subjects who have active ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, other inflammatory
             bowel disease.

          -  Subjects with known malignancy requiring treatment &lt; 6 months prior to study
             screening.

          -  Subjects who have, in the opinion of the investigator, significant concurrent medical
             illness.

          -  Subjects who are currently taking concomitant medications which may interfere with
             study evaluation.

          -  Subjects who have received an investigational drug within 30 days or within a time
             period consistent with a washout period of 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, of the
             first dose of ceftriaxone.

          -  Subjects with a known history of allergy to any cephalosporin, penicillin or any
             β-lactam antibiotic.

          -  Subjects who have known active malabsorption syndromes(s) that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, could compromise the objectives of the study.

          -  Subjects who have used any oral, intramuscular, or IV anti-microbial medication
             during the last 3 week
