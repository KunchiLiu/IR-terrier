      This phase II trial studies how well mTOR complex 1 and 2 (TORC1/2) Inhibitor INK128 works
      in treating patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has returned after a period of
      improvement (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). TORC1/2
      Inhibitor INK128 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the complete hematologic response (CR)/complete response with complete response
      incomplete (CRi) rate when MLN0128 (TORC1/2 Inhibitor INK128) is administered to adult
      patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate (CR, CRi/partial response (PR)/morphologic leukemia
      free state [MLFS]).

      II. Determine the CR/CRi duration when MLN0128 is administered to adult patients with
      relapsed/refractory ALL.

      III. Determine the frequency of proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) for
      patients with relapsed/refractory ALL who achieve a response on MLN0128.

      IV. Determine the overall survival for relapsed/refractory ALL patients on MLN0128.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 in ALL patients. II. Assess whether
      phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) substrate 4EBP1 decreases in
      leukemic blasts harvested from the bone marrow on day 8 compared to baseline.

      III. Assess in an exploratory fashion whether MLN0128 enhances expression of the
      pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Puma in marrow ALL cells.

      IV. Assess in an exploratory fashion whether myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) levels decrease
      in blast cells during MLN0128 treatment.

      V. Assess in an exploratory fashion whether a) the phospho-protein pattern at baseline or b)
      MLN0128-associated changes in the phospho-protein pattern differs between ALL samples that
      respond to therapy and those that do not.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive MLN0128 orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 12 courses after response in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.

    <description>The frequency is estimated by the number of patients who proceed to allogeneic SCT after achieving response divided by the total number of evaluable patients who achieved a response.

             treating physician; also must not exceed the number of prior induction regimens
             listed above; SCT does not count as line of therapy

          -  Negative serum pregnancy; women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of MLN0128
             administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Prior therapy with mTOR inhibitors except for rapalog treatment as part of
             graft-versus-host (GVH) prophylaxis or treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to entering the
             study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered
             more than 4 weeks earlier; treatment with glucocorticoids, hydroxyurea, and tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors is allowed up to 24 hour prior to initiation of therapy

          -  Patients with white blood cell (WBC) &gt; 30,000 are not eligible to start therapy;
             however, it is permissible to use glucocorticoids and/or hydroxyurea to diminish
             peripheral WBC to less than 30,000 provided these agents are stopped at least 24
             hours prior to the first dose of MLN0128

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known other active cancers; skin cancers (basal or squamous) are
             exempted

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to MLN0128

          -  Because of the low potential for interaction with agents that induce or inhibit
             cytochrome P450 enzymes, there are no prohibitions of specific medications on the
             basis of anticipated drug-drug interactions

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             MLN0128; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, as lymphocyte numbers and function will be
             further suppressed by MLN0128; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated
