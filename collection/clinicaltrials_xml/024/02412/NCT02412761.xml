  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children are increasingly being diagnosed with essential hypertension and the absence of
      comparative effectiveness research in antihypertensive therapies has contributed to
      considerable differences in prescribing practices among physicians treating children with
      essential hypertension.

      This study will consist of a series of systematically-administered n-of-1 trials among
      children to verify the need for ongoing antihypertensive treatment and if so, to identify
      the preferred single drug therapy.

    <textblock>
      This is a series of systematically-administered n-of-1 trials among children with essential
      hypertension to verify the need for ongoing antihypertensive treatment and if so, to
      identify the preferred single drug therapy from among the three major classes of drugs
      commonly used for essential hypertension (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium
      channel blockers, and diuretics). The investigators will determine whether there is one that
      is preferred for the great majority of patients. The &quot;preferred&quot; therapy will be defined as
      the drug which produces normal ambulatory blood pressure, with the greatest reduction in
      awake mean systolic blood pressure without unacceptable side effects.

      For each patient, the order of the 3 drugs will be assigned randomly and each drug will be
      taken for 2 weeks. The effectiveness of each drug will be measured with 24-hour ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring, and tolerability will be assessed using a side effect
      questionnaire. Participants will rotate through treatment periods, repeating drugs and
      adjusting doses until the preferred therapy is identified. In assessing whether one the
      medications is most effective for the great majority of subjects, the primary outcome will
      be the percentage of participants for whom each drug is selected as the preferred therapy.
      Primary hypothesis: no drug will be selected for the majority of the subjects, a finding
      that would support consideration of clinical use of n-of-1 trials. Secondary analyses will
      explore whether patient characteristics predict which medication will be selected as a
      preferred drug.
