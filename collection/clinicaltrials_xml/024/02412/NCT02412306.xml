    <textblock>
      Open-label combined two-part multi-center clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety,
      and tolerabillity of blinatumomab in adult and pediatric Japanese subjects with R/R
      B-precursor ALL.

      The Phase 1b part will investigate the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of blinatumomab in adult
      Japanse subects with R/R B-precursor ALL to determine the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) in
      both adult and pediatric subjects. Once a dose has been selected in the Phase 1b part, the
      Phase 2 part will assess the safety and efficacy of the recommeded dose level of
      blinatumomab identified in the Phase 1b portion of the study in the adult study population.

    <description>Blinatumomab is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI). A cycle = 6 weeks (4 weeks of blinatumomab treatment, 2-week treatment-free) . Each cohort in the study will receive a combination of 2 dose levels. In the first induction cycle, the initial dose of blinatumomab will be the lower assigned dose level (Days 1-7), then escalated (dose step) to the higher assigned dose (Days 8-29). For all subsequent cycles (beginning with the second induction cycle and continuing through consolidation and maintenance, for applicable subjects) the higher assigned dose level will be the dose for all 4 weeks of continuous treatment.</description>
