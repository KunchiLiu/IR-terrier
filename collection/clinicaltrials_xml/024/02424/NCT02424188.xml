  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether an 18-month practical tobacco smoking cessation program
      integrating weight management counseling and exercise will be superior to treatment as usual
      in achieving prolonged smoking abstinence in persons with serious mental illness.

      The objective of this study is to perform a randomized clinical trial (TRIUMPH) in persons
      with serious mental illness to test the hypothesis that intervention participants will have
      higher rates of smoking abstinence at 18 months than participants in the treatment as usual
      arm. The intervention includes group and individual smoking cessation and weight management
      counseling tailored by a participant's readiness to quit, pharmacotherapy with either
      varenicline or buproprion plus nicotine replacement therapy prescribed in the community
      clinic, exercise, and text messaging supporting health behavior change.
