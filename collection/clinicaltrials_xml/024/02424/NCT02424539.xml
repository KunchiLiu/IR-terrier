  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline over the first 2 Weeks treatment period in daily, reflective total nasal symptom scores (rTNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS is the sum of symptom scores for nasal congestion, nasal itching, rhinorrhea and sneezing (each scored on a scale of 0 [none] to 3 [severe]; total possible score of 0 to 12). The rTNSS (performed in the morning [AM] and evening [PM]) was a rating of the severity of symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The daily rTNSS was the average of the AM rTNSS and PM rTNSS assessments. Change from Baseline is calculated as the score over the first 2 Weeks minus the score at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from Baseline of intranasal finding score by anterior rhinoscopy at the first 2 Weeks (Day 15) and at the end of the treatment Week 4 (Day 29)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The nasal finding score by rhinoscopy is the sum of 4 individual investigator assessed scores for swelling of inferior nasal concha mucosa, color of inferior nasal concha mucosa, watery secretion volume, and description of rhinorrhea. The symptoms were assessed using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe. Change from Baseline in nasal finding score by rhinoscopy was calculated as the post-Baseline score (at Week 2 and Week 4) minus the Baseline score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline over the first 2 Weeks and over the 4 Weeks treatment period in the daily, reflective total ocular symptoms score ( rTOSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>TOSS is the sum of the 3 individual ocular symptom scores for eyes itching/burning, eyes watering and eye redness. The symptoms were assessed using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe with a maximum score of 9. Scores for both eyes will be averaged. The rTOSS is a rating of the severity of symptoms over the previous 12 hours and was performed in the AM (AM rTOSS) and PM (PM rTOSS). Change from Baseline in the daily, rTOSS was calculated as the post-Baseline score (at Week 2 and Week 4) minus the Baseline score.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant Medical Conditions: (a) Significant concomitant medical conditions
             defined as historical or current evidence of clinically significant uncontrolled
             disease of any body system. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would confound the interpretation of the study results
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study: significant renal impairment,
             which based on the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the subjects'
             participation in the study and current active liver or biliary disease (with the
             exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable
             chronic liver disease per investigator assessment). (NOTES: Stable chronic liver
             disease should generally be defined by the absence of ascites, encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia, oesophageal or gastric varices, or persistent
             jaundice, or cirrhosis and Chronic stable hepatitis B and C [e.g., presence of
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C antibody test result at
             screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment] are acceptable
             if subject otherwise meets entry criteria). (b) A severe physical obstruction of the

             excipients in the product. (e) Recent nasal septal surgery or nasal septal
             perforation. (f) Subjects start, discontinue or change desensitization treatment
             within 30 days prior to Visit 1. (g) Bacterial or viral infection of the eyes or
             upper respiratory tract within two weeks of Visit 1 or during the screening period.
             (h) Asthma, with the exception of mild intermittent asthma. (i) Diagnosis of rhinitis
             medicamentosa, vasomotor AR or eosinophil rhinitis.

          -  Abnormal Laboratory Findings: A clinically significant laboratory abnormality
             including Liver Function Tests at Visit 1 meeting the following criteria: Alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35 percent [%]).

          -  Abnormal Electocardiogram (ECG): Clinically significant abnormal ECG finding at Visit
             1. Significant is defined as: Corrected QT (QTc) &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt;
             480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected
             for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF),
             and/or another method, machine-read or manually over-read. The specific formula that
             will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an individual subject
             should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words, several
             different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and
             then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trail.

             intranasal decongestants; Oral or intranasal antileukotrienes; Oral or inhaled
             long-acting beta2 agonists; Chinese traditional medicines that have potential effect
             to AR; Liquorice preparation; Medications that significantly inhibit the CYP3A4,
             including ritonavir and ketoconazole; tricyclic antidepressants; long-acting
             antihistamines( eg. desloratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine and loratadine [ taken as
             rescue medication]); Intranasal antihistamines; or Intranasal or ocular cromolyh;
             Intranasal corticosteroids includes: Inhaled, oral, intramuscular, intravenous,
             ocular and/or dermatological corticosteroid (with the exception of hydrocortisone
             cream/ointment, 1% or less) and Immunosuppressive medications; Subcutaneous
             omalizumab.
