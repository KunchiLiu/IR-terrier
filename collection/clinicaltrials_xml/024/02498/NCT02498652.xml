    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, open-label, multicenter study to assess the pharmacodynamic
      (PD) effects of RDEA3170 administered in combination with allopurinol compared with
      allopurinol administered alone in adult subjects with gout.

          -  Subject has a Screening serum urate level ≥ 8 mg/dL.

          -  Subject is free of any clinically significant disease or medical condition, per the
             Investigator's judgment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history or suspicion of kidney stones.

          -  Subject has any gastrointestinal disorder that affects motility and/or absorption.

          -  Subject had unstable angina, New York Heart Association class III or IV heart
             failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, or deep venous thrombosis within 12 months
             prior to Day 1; or subject is currently receiving anticoagulants.

          -  Subject has Screening laboratory parameters that are outside the normal limits and
             are considered clinically significant by the Investigator.

          -  Subject has an estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min calculated by the
             Cockcroft-Gault formula using ideal body weight during the Screening period.
