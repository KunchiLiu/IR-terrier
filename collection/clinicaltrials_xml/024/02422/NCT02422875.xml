  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare immune phenotype, function, and specificity of B
      lymphocytes from different developmental stages in autoimmune patients to B cells from
      infectious disease patients and healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>

      It is essential to analyze the distribution of autoreactive B cells within bone marrow in
      order to study immature B cell developmental subsets, which are not present in the
      peripheral blood. Lymphocyte subsets from bone marrow will be characterized as described
      above for peripheral blood.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        -  Subjects with certain autoimmune conditions or if subjects have brothers, sisters,
             mother, father, or children with an autoimmune condition

          -  Subjects with certain infectious diseases

          -  Subjects who are without an autoimmune condition or infectious disease

          -  Subjects who have received or will receive a vaccination as part of their regular
             standard of care from one of their healthcare providers

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent by the subject or, if the subject is unable to
             provide informed consent, the subject's legal representative may provide consent.

          -  Subjects can be of either gender

          -  Subjects with autoimmune diseases, and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients
             will fulfill the American College of Rheumatology Classification criteria for SLE to
             be determined by their treating physician but may have incomplete criteria (&lt;4
             items). SLE patients are not restricted by treatment or by disease activity as
             determined by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) or
             Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) score

               1. Subjects with acute exacerbations of their disease, including hospitalized
                  patients

               2. First-degree relatives of subjects with active disease

          -  Subjects who have received or will receive a vaccination may be enrolled for bone
             marrow aspirates before and/or after vaccination. Vaccination will have been done by
             the subject's healthcare provider or through another outside source.

          -  Subjects may have a screening blood draw performed in cases where a certain subset of
             cells or antibody titer is desired. This may be followed by additional blood draws
             and/or bone marrow aspiration after the ideal candidates have been identified.

          -  Subjects who have been diagnosed with HIV or another infectious disease

          -  Healthy controls must be free of acute or chronic disease at the time of bone marrow
             donation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poor venous access

          -  Subjects who have had side effects to local anesthetics such as Lidocaine and who are
             on blood thinners such as warfarin

          -  Normal controls must be free of acute or chronic diseases or medications that may
             affect the assay (as determined by the investigator).

          -  Insufficient access to the iliac crest and bone is hindered. This generally
             correlates to a BMI (Body Mass Index) of greater than 25.0.
