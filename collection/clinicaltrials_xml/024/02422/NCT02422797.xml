  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if virologically suppressed, human immunodeficiency
      virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected adults on an antiretroviral regimen (including 2 nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus a third agent) remain suppressed upon
      switching to a two-drug regimen with dolutegravir (DTG) + rilpivirine (RPV). The study will
      primarily assess the non-inferiority antiviral activity of switching to DTG + RPV once daily
      compared to continuation of current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) up to Week 48 with a switch
      visit for eligible subjects in the CAR group to initiate DTG + RPV therapy at Week 52. CAR
      will include 2 NRTIs plus 1 HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (INI), or 1 non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or 1 protease inhibitor (PI). The study will include a
      148-week open-label treatment phase, comprising of an Early Switch Phase (Day 1 to Week 52)
      and a Late Switch Phase (Week 52 to Week 148). The participants fulfilling the study
      eligibility criteria will participate in the Early Switch Phase where they will either
      switch from their CAR to DTG + RPV, or continue taking their CAR, until Week 52. At the end
      of Early Switch Phase, eligible participants will proceed to the Late Switch Phase where all
      participants in both DTG + RPV and CAR treatment groups will receive DTG + RPV therapy until
      Week 148. After Week 148, subjects may be eligible to continue to receive DTG +RPV in the
      Continuation Phase. The study is planned to be conducted in approximately 476 participants.

             provided to GlaxoSmithKline, after screening and before randomization, to provide
             direct evidence of no pre-existing exclusionary resistance mutations. You must wait

             which will be provided before the screening window closes.

          -  Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality, with the exception of Grade 4 lipid

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion of the
