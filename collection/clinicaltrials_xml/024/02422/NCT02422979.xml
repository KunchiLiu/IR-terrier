    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, two part, study of patients with recurrent Head and Neck Cancer (HNC),
      who in the opinion of their physician, cannot be satisfactorily treated with surgery,
      radiation or platinum chemotherapy. Part I is a drug dose-escalation, fixed low fluency
      light application study to determine the drug dose that can be safely given to saturate the
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at the tumor.

      Part II is a light treatment dose-escalation, fixed drug dosing infusion study to determine
      the optimal light application, in combination with the Part I drug dose, needed to achieve
      clinical response with an acceptable safety profile.

    <textblock>
      Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is a new cancer targeted technology invented at the National Cancer
      Institute, USA. PIT utilizes monoclonal antibodies conjugated to a dye (abbreviated as
      IR700) that can be activated upon near-infrared light illumination to induce rapid cell
      killing only at cells expressing the antigen and only after antibody binding to the cellular
      antigen. The requirement of light-induced activation and antigen-antibody binding to induce
      cell killing enables the selective destruction of only cancer cells with minimum damage of
      healthy tissue surrounding the tumor cells. Photoimmunotherapy requires two treatment steps:
      (i) the administration of the drug by infusion AND (ii) the irradiation of the tumor with
      690 nm light using sufficient energy (light fluence) to induce cell killing. Light
      irradiation is typically applied between 24 hours to 72 hours post drug administration to
      enable drug distribution within the tumor.

      The experimental drug therapy, RM-1929, is an injectable formulation consisting of a
      chemical conjugate of the dye IR700 with the FDA approved antibody, Erbitux® (Cetuximab),
      that targets EGFR antigens. EGFR is highly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas of the head
      and neck, and Erbitux® Photoimmunotherapy with RM-1929 may result in significant
      improvements of is clinically used to treat HNC and colorectal cancers. It is expected that
      systemic administration of RM-1929 will lead to tumor accumulation of RM-1929 and binding to
      EGFR expressed at cancer cells. After RM-1929 administration, subsequent light irradiation
      should induce rapid tumor destruction of recurrent HNCs and provide an effective therapy to
      manage the disease. Preclinical pharmacology demonstrated that light-induced activation of
      RM-1929 elicits rapid tumor destruction of human cancer xenografts implanted in mice
      progression free survival and overall survival with better quality of life than when using
      existing standard of care (SOC) approaches.

      Part I of this study will determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of RM-1929 administered
      by IV infusion using a single low energy localized light irradiation. Upon identifying an
      optimal light fluence, Part II will then explore the safety and anecdotal efficacy
      associated with repeat dosing of up to 4 treatment cycles in patients who display an
      incomplete tumor response.

      Both parts of the study will document the safety profile of each treatment cohort as well as
      the pharmacokinetics of RM-1929. Preliminary efficacy outcomes will also be recorded.

             to breast feed during the study and for at least two months after discontinuation of
             Erbitux® or study medication. Male patients should be using a double barrier
             protection method that is a medically acceptable form of birth control during the
             study or be sterile.

          5. Patients must have an ECOG score of 0 - 2.

          6. Patient must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an
