  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, 2 period, crossover study in up to 36 healthy and
      chronic cough subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 24 chronic cough subjects and 12 healthy subjects who meet all entry criteria
      will be randomly assigned to AF-219 or placebo.

      There will be a Screening period, two Baseline Visits, and two Treatment periods with a
      minimum of a 48-hour washout period between treatments. Subjects will return two weeks after
      their last Treatment Visit for a Follow-up Visit.

      At Baseline and during each Treatment period, cough sensitivity will be measured by standard
      clinical methodology incorporating four cough challenges (capsaicin, citric acid, ATP,
      distilled water).

      Daytime cough monitoring will be performed at Baseline and during each of the two treatment
      periods (cough subjects only).

             months), agree to use 2 forms of acceptable birth control; or if a male, they and/or
             their partner of child-bearing potential agree to use 2 forms of acceptable birth
             control;

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             trial results and, in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor, would make the
             subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.
