      Objectives:

      To compare the prevalence of clinical symptoms of stomach problems between patients with
      progressive discontinuation (one week of esomeprazole, 20mg, then discontinuation) or those
      with sudden discontinuation of esomeprazole 40mg. The presence of clinical symptoms, as
      reported in the modified-Proton Pump Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test (PASS) test
      will be weekly assessed until 4 weeks after the inclusion.

      Study design:

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 156 patients treated by
      esomeprazole 40mg since 4 weeks or more, randomized to 1 week of placebo or one week of
      esomeprazole 20mg.

      The first day of the study (Day 0), three blood samples will be collected at fast to measure
      chromogranine A (CgA), gastrinemia, and Helicobacter Pilory (HP) serology. Cytochrome P450
      (CYP)2C19 activity will be assessed.

      Then, at Day 1, the patients will receive esomeprazole 20mg or placebo for 7 days (Day1-8).

      Participants will complete the PASS test once a week on the same weekday throughout the
      study (Day8-D15-D22-D29), during a telephone interview or a consultation, if it was
      scheduled in the clinical follow up of the study.

      Duration of treatment:

      Esomeprazole or placebo for one week (Day1-8) Omeprazole single dose (Day0) Time plan of
      research

      Duration for the patient:

      The treatments will stop after 7 days. The questionnaires will be collected until the 4th
      week, Day29.

      Overall duration of inclusion: one year Maximal overall duration of the study: 365 days+29
      days=394 days Maximal delay for communication of the results: 2 years

      ** Objectives

      Primary objective:

      To compare the prevalence of clinical symptoms of acid rebound, between patients with
      progressive or sudden discontinuation of Proton pump inhibitors. The presence of clinical
      symptoms, as described in the first question of the Proton Pump Inhibitor Acid Suppression
      Symptom Test will be the primary end-point, assessed at 4 weeks the inclusion.

      Secondary objective:

      To compare the prevalence of clinical symptoms of acid rebound between patients with
      progressive or sudden discontinuation of Proton pump inhibitors at 1,2 and 3 weeks.

      To compare the consequences of the clinical symptoms using the modified-Proton Pump
      Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test between patients with progressive or sudden
      discontinuation of Proton pump inhibitors at 1,2,3 and 4 weeks.

      To evaluate the relationship between P-gastrin, Chromogranine A, Helicobacter pilory and the
      clinical symptom scores.

      **Study design

      Overall description:

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 156 patients treated by
      esomeprazole 40mg since almost 4 weeks, for who its withdrawal has been decided randomized
      to 1 week of placebo or 1 week of esomeprazole 20mg.

      Patients will be recruited during their hospitalization at the time their clinician decides
      to withdraw esomeprazole. A first interview with the clinician will take place to inform the
      patient of the protocol, the day of this clinical decision. A written information will be
      given and another interview will take place the same day for the inclusion in the case of
      agreement.

      Then, the first day of the study (Day0), three blood samples will be collected at fast to
      measure Chromogranine A, gastrinemia, and Helicobacter Pilory serology. Then, the patient
      will receive an only dose of 40mg (CYP2C19 activity) in order to assess the CYP2C19 activity
      by a capillary concentration two hours later.

      Then, at Day1, the patients will receive esomeprazole 20mg or placebo for 7 days (Day1-8).

      Participants will complete the modified-Proton Pump Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test
      once a week on the same weekday throughout the study (Day8-15-22-29), during a telephone
      interview or a consultation, if it was scheduled in the clinical follow up of the study.

      **Primary and secondary end-points

      Primary outcome:

      The clinical significance of the rebound acid symptoms is defined by the presence of almost
      one of these clinical symptoms.

        1. Stomach pain or discomfort,

        2. Heartburn (a burning feeling rising from the stomach or lower chest towards the neck or
           burning feeling located behind the breastbone which may or may not rise in the chest) ;

        3. Sour taste in mouth/acid regurgitation (feeling of regurgitation or unpleasant feeling
           moving upwards to the mouth) ;

        4. Excessive burping/belching (passing of gas through the mouth) ;

        5. Increased abdominal bloating (feeling of abdominal distension or fullness) ;

        6. Nausea (the sensation of needing to vomit) ;

        7. Early satiety (feeling full just after eating or not able to finish meals)&quot; These
           symptoms are described in the Proton Pump Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test,
           initially deigned to assess the resolution of gastroesophageal reflux disease-symptoms
           following the introduction of Proton Pump Inhibitors. This test will be slightly
           modified to measure the outcome of the study.

      Secondary outcome measure:

        -  The consequence of the Rebound acid symptoms, using the questions of the Proton Pump
           Inhibitor Acid Suppression Symptom Test test according to the presence of clinical

        -  Gastrin and Chromogranin A.

        -  Helicobacter pilory serology

             -  Study population

           pregnancy or current breastfeeding

      Withdrawal criteria:

      The different procedures for withdrawal from the study are:

      For patients randomized

        -  Discontinuation of the study due to intolerance or adverse drug reactions. For all
           patients

        -  Evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding after inclusion in the study;

        -  Right of withdrawal from the study without justification;

      Patient lost of follow-up will be considered as having had clinical symptoms of acid
      rebound.

      **Selection and recruitment procedures

           de réhabilitation or in the Clinique romande de réhabilitation : Only patients who

    <description>The five-item PASS test is a valid tool for the evaluation of persistent acid-related symptoms in patients receiving PPI therapy. It demonstrates good content validity, test-retest reliability, responsiveness and construct validity in both English and French forms. The PASS test is a simple, clinically applicable tool for the identification of patients with persistent acid-related symptoms during therapy and the assessment of their responses to a change in therapy.
The investigators will modifiy the first question for the study. While, it is usually asked: &quot; Are you taking prescription medication for any of the following stomach problems/symptoms:… &quot; ; in the study, the investigators will ask : &quot; Do you have any of the following stomach problems/symptoms : … &quot;.
With any of the 7 symptoms, the patient will be considered as symptomatic.</description>
