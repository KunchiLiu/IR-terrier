    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Sensi-StopTM strips (Procter &amp;
      Gamble™) on the relief of dentinal hypersensitivity. In other words, do Sensi-StopTM strips
      (Procter &amp; Gamble™) reduce or eliminate cold sensitivity in teeth? In addition, the
      investigators will evaluate whether there is a difference in the Sensi-StopTM strip (Procter
      &amp; Gamble™) effectiveness when the product is placed by a dental professional compared to
      self-placement by the person with sensitive teeth. This product is not experimental.

      There are two groups in this research study: 1) The Self Applied group, and 2) the
      Professionally Applied group.

      Once it is determined that interested individuals qualify to participate in the study and
      have determined that they want to participate, the group that participants are in will be
      determined. The study has been designed to ensure that 66% of the study participants
      receives strips that contain the active ingredient and 33% of the subjects receive strips
      without the active ingredient. This means that there is a 1 out of 3 chance that
      participants will be assigned to receive the strip(s) without the active desensitizing
      ingredient. At the end of your 8-week participation, if it turns out that participants
      received the strips without the active ingredient, they will be offered a sample pack with
      two strips that contain the active desensitizing ingredient for them to use at home.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient presents in good general health with no allergies to commercial dental
             products and are currently not using any desensitizing agents.

          -  If participants are using desensitizing agent the participant must agree to not use
             any desensitizing agents in the 4 weeks leading up to the baseline data collection
             appointment and during the following 8 week length of the study.

          -  Patients with a history of having used Sensi-Stop Strips (Procter &amp; Gamble™) in the
             past will not be eligible to participate because it will not be possible to maintain
             blindness to the treatment that they receive.

          -  Patients will also have at least the following baseline measurements:

             i. Schiff Air Scale = equal to or greater than 1

        ii. Verbal Rating Scale = equal to or greater than 1

        iii. Recession= 1mm or greater

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any dental pathology resulting in pain that could confound the study findings would
             render the patient ineligible: e.g. advanced dental decay, pulpitis, fractured teeth,
             fractured restorations, chipped teeth, cracked teeth, severe gingival inflammation,
             post-restorative sensitivity, marginal leakage, severe periodontal disease, as
             characterized by purulent exudate, generalized mobility, and/or severe recession.

          -  Also, if potential study subjects are not willing to agree to avoid the use of
             desensitizing and/or whitening products they will not be enrolled.

          -  Adults lacking in the ability to give consent will also be excluded.
