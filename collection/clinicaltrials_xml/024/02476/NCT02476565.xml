  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of intubating
      the tracheal using an Aintree intubation catheter through either the LMA-S or I-gel
      supraglottic devices
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the proposal, the investigators are comparing two different types of supraglottic
      devices. One is the LMA Supreme (laryngeal mask airway) and the other is the I-gel. The
      study is designed to use the supraglottic airway device as an adjunct to tracheal
      intubation, not as the definitive airway. The investigators will be utilizing the Aintree
      intubation catheter over the fiberoptic bronchoscope in an effort to secure the airway. This
      technique has been well described in the literature and has been proven effective and safe.
