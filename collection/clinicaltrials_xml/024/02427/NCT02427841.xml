      This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
      and gemcitabine hydrochloride followed by radiation therapy before surgery work in treating
      patients with pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and radiation
      therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue
      that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the R0 (complete resection) resection rate for subjects with borderline
      resectable or lymph node positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with a multimodality
      neoadjuvant therapy of preoperative gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and ABRAXANE
      (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) followed by 5-fluorouracil
      (fluorouracil) based image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT)
      chemoradiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine 1-year relapse-free survival rate with the investigational protocol.

      II. To determine 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates. III. To assess response rate by
      imaging (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1) and pathologic analysis.

      IV. To assess the toxicity and safety according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) criteria.

      V. To assess molecular predictors of response and survival (serum cancer antigen (CA) 19-9
      and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) expression).

      OUTLINE:

      PRE-OPERATIVE (NEOADJUVANT) CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3-6 weeks after
      completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo IG-IMRT 5 days a week for 28 fractions and
      receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-7 for 6 weeks.

      SURGICAL RESECTION: Patients undergo surgery 4-10 weeks after the last dose of
      chemoradiation.

      POST-OPERATIVE (ADUJUVANT) CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning within 8-12 weeks after surgery, patients
      receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for 4 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 3 years and
      then every 24 weeks for 2 years.
