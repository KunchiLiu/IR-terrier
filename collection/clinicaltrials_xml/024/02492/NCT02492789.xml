    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I trial to
      evaluate safety and tolerability of INCSHR01210 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The
      trial will enroll subjects with advanced solid tumor who have failed current standard
      anti-tumor therapies.

    <description>3 dose levels are designed in this study: 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg.3 to 6 patients (traditional &quot;3+3&quot; design) will be enrolled in each dose cohort. INCSHR01210 injection at a dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg is administered every 2 weeks (q2w, except in the first cycle).</description>

    <description>Part1: INCSHR01210 injection at a dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg is administered every 2 weeks (3+3,q2w, except in the first cycle, in which subjects will be only dosed once on Day 1 for PK samplings and dose limiting toxicity observation). Response is assessed by every 2 cycles (4 weeks each cycle) by using irRECIST.
Part2: Additional patients (tentatively, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg dose cohorts. The dose cohorts may be modified, based on the objective data achieved from Part 1, to facilitate RP2D identification and preliminary anti-tumor activities of INCSHR01210) will be enrolled in Part 2, depending on the data outcomes in Part 1, to further explore preliminarily clinical benefits of INCSHR01210 as well as the other objectives of the study.</description>

             colitis (inflammatory bowel disease), hepatitis, hypophysitis, nephritis,
             hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism, except for subjects with vitiligo or resolved
             childhood asthma/atopy. Subjects with the following conditions will not be excluded

             psychiatric, or social condition deemed by the investigator to be likely to interfere
