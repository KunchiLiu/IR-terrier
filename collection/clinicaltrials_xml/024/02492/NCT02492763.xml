  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (liraglutide;
      Victoza®), parallel-group, clinical trial of MK-8521 in participants with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control while on a stable dose of metformin (≥1000
      mg/day).

      The trial will include a 1-week screening period; an 8-week antihyperglycemic agent (AHA)
      washout period, if required; a 14-week blinded therapy period (which includes single-blind
      run-in and double-blind therapy); and a 14-day post-treatment visit, 2 weeks after the last
      dose of investigational product.

      The primary hypotheses of the trial are to assess the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C)-lowering
      efficacy of the addition of MK-8521 relative to placebo and to evaluate safety and
      tolerability of MK-8521.
