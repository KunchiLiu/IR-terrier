    <textblock>
      This research study is investigating a drug called PM01183 alone and in combination with
      chemotherapy drugs called gemcitabine or doxorubicin as a possible treatment for metastatic
      or unresectable Sarcoma.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      PM01183 is a new drug that is believed to bind DNA cause double strands of DNA to break.
      This drug has been studied in previous research studies, and these suggest that it may slow
      or stop the growth of cancers. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not
      approved PM01183 as a treatment for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are trying to assess the effects, good or bad,
      that PM01183, administered either alone or in combination with gemcitabine or doxorubicin
      has on metastatic or unresectable sarcoma.
