  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cluster-randomized control trial will study the effect of insecticide-treated wall lining
      on malaria transmission in Bomi County, Liberia. Half of the villages enrolled in the study
      will receive insecticide-treated wall lining covering their walls and ceilings in addition
      to long-lasting insecticidal nets, while the other half will be protected by existing
      long-lasting insecticidal nets.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the established vector control product for
      malaria control. In Bomi County Liberia, LLINs have been distributed but malaria prevalence
      in children under 5 remains high, with prevalence in study villages found to be 42% in April
      2014. The major malaria vector species are resistant to pyrethroid insecticides approved for
      use in LLINs, and new control measures with non-pyrethroid active ingredients may protect
      the population.
