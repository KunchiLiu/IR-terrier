  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposal, the investigators will develop a culturally-tailored, 8-week clinic-based
      weight loss program to reduce obesity among postpartum African American (AA) adult women
      that can be integrated into a postpartum care model within a clinical setting.

      The investigators proposal adapts The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) 16 session core
      curriculum to our 8 session model and in addition uses the cultural tailoring techniques of
      the DPP to address the needs of our AA population in several ways: 1) The reference
      materials and lesson handouts include information about the types of foods and cooking
      methods used by an AA culture (see Other Study Documents); 2) Topics are selected for group
      classes that are most appropriate for our participants such as Hip Hop or Salsa dancing for
      physical activity.

      Participants will be randomized during the early postpartum period to either usual care or
      intervention. Usual care participants will be offered the weight management standard of care
      which is one visit with a dietitian in the Nutrition and Weight Management Center.
      Intervention participants will be assigned a Birth Sister for the postpartum period. They
      will also attend 8 weekly sessions for the weight loss program. All participants will
      complete study assessment visits at 6 weeks postpartum and 15 weeks postpartum.
