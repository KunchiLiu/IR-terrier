    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAX69 in combination
      with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV) or panitumumab to determine the recommended phase
      II dose (RP2D) of each combination; and to compare the efficacy between BAX69 in combination
      with 5-FU/LV for subjects with KRAS or NRAS mutated tumor (mt) or panitumumab, for subjects
      with KRAS and NRAS wild type tumor (wt) and standard of care (SoC) per investigator choice
      as third or fourth treatment line in subjects with progressive measurable metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC).
