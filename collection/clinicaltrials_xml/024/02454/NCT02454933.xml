      A Phase III, Multi-Centre, Open Label, Randomized Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of
      AZD9291 in Combination with MEDI4736 versus AZD9291 Monotherapy in patients with Locally

      This a phase III, Multi Centre, Open Label, Randomized, Study to Assess the Efficacy and
      Safety of AZD9291 (80 mg, orally, once daily) in Combination with MEDI4736 (10 mg/kg (IV)
      infusion q2w) versus AZD9291 Monotherapy (80 mg, orally, once daily) in patients with a
      confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation positive
      NSCLC, who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent. The randomization will be stratified by
      previous lines of treatment (2nd or 3rd+) and ethnicity (Asian or Non-Asian). A mandatory
      biopsy will be needed for central testing of T790M mutation status following confirmed
      disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. The primary objective of the study
      is to assess the efficacy of AZD9291 in combination with MEDI4736 versus AZD9291 monotherapy
      by assessment of Progression Free Survival (PFS) by investigators according to Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

      Approximately 350 patients will be evaluated and will consist of 2 populations:

        1. 2nd line: patients who have progressed following an approved first-line EGFR-TKI
           treatment but who have not received further treatment.

        2. 3rd line or higher: patients who have progressed following prior therapy with an
           approved EGFR-TKI and an additional anti-cancer treatment. Patients may have also
           received additional lines of treatment.
