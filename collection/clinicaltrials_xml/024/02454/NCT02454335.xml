  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an incisionless procedure used to treat esophageal
      achalasia, performed by GI endoscopist without cutting any surface of the human body. The
      main constituent of the procedure is the myotomy part, through which the endoscopist cuts
      the muscle fibers in the submucosa. Since this procedure is completely new to the area of
      treatment of achalasia, it is unknown whether a posterior or an anterior myotomy is better
      in relieving the symptoms. Thenceforth, this study aims at randomizing patients with
      achalasia presenting for POEM to getting either the posterior or the anterior myotomy.
      Patients will be followed up for symptoms and complications; data will be extracted and the
      appropriate analysis will be employed to determine if there is any difference of outcome
      between the two techniques of myotomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) is an effective, minimally-invasive treatment for
      achalasia that has been adopted over the past few years. As more programs attempt to adopt
      the novel technique, there is an increased need for trials to help guide the growth of the
      procedure. Review of the current literature reveals that most endoscopists prefer an
      anterior approach, with an incision in the anterior/ anterolateral wall of the esophagus.
      This approach has been used with tremendous success in decreasing the symptoms of dysphagia
      and lowering esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure since the first description of the
      procedure in humans in 2010. However, it can be technically challenging in patients with
      anterior scarring from prior surgery or radiation, in whom a posterior approach has
      typically been used. Alternatively, the posterior approach, with incision in the
      posterolateral wall of the esophagus, has been adopted with great success by several
      endoscopists as the primary approach to myotomy. Reports involving the posterior approach
      have also shown significant symptom relief as defined by symptoms score (Eckardt score) &lt; 3,
      decreased LES pressure, and low complication rates.

      However, despite high rates of technical and clinical success, the posterior approach has
      not been as widely adopted as the anterior approach. Without comparison of the two
      approaches in terms of efficacy and safety, the optimal technique to myotomy for POEM is yet
      to be defined. The investigators main hypothesis is that the posterior myotomy is as
      efficacious as the anterior myotomy in terms of improvement of achalasia symptoms as
      indicated by reduction in the Eckardt score and LES pressure. Adaptation of both techniques
      may increase options in approach for routine POEM and increase the number of patients that
      are able to undergo the procedure, thereby promoting its applicability.

    <description>The standardized clinical scoring system for achalasia will be assessed at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post procedure. The score is based on the results of a self- administered questionnaire using 4 items related to digestive symptoms including weight loss, dysphagia, retrosternal pain, and regurgitation. Each item is rated from 0 to 3 (0= none, 1= occasional, 2=daily, 3=with every meal).</description>
