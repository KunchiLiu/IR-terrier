        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 40 years of age and no older than 80 at Screening

          -  Women of non-child bearing potential or negative serum pregnancy test at Screening,
             and agrees to acceptable contraceptive methods used consistently and correctly
             Screening until 14 days after final visit.

          -  Subjects with an established clinical history of COPD as defined by the American
             Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS)

          -  Current or former smokers with a history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette
             smoking

          -  Pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;0.70

          -  Post-bronchodilator FEV1 must be &lt;80% predicted normal value, calculated using NHANES
             III reference equations, and the measured FEV1 must also be ≥30% of predicted normal
             value.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant diseases other than COPD, i.e., disease or condition which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may put the subject at risk because of participation in
             the study or may influence either the results of the study or the subject's ability
             to participate in the study.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating or women of childbearing potential who are not
             using an acceptable method of contraception.

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, have a current diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Subjects who have been hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 3 months
             prior to Screening or during the Screening Period.

          -  Subjects who have poorly controlled COPD, defined as acute worsening of COPD that
             requires treatment with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to
             Screening or during the Screening Period.

          -  Subjects who have clinically significant uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Subjects who have cancer that has not been in complete remission for at least five
             years.

          -  Subjects with abnormal liver function tests defined as AST, ALT, or total bilirubin
             ≥1.5 times upper limit of normal at Screening and on repeat testing.

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of angle closure glaucoma will be excluded, regardless of
             whether or not they have been treated. Subjects with a diagnosis of open angle
             glaucoma who have intraocular pressure controlled with medication(s) are eligible.

          -  Subjects with symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy that is clinically significant in the
             opinion of the Investigator. Subjects with a trans-urethral resection of prostate
             (TURP) or full resection of the prostate within 6 months prior to Screening are
             excluded from the study.

          -  Subjects with bladder neck obstruction or urinary retention that is clinically
             significant in the opinion of the Investigator.
