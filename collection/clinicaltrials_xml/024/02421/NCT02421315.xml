      The purpose of this study is to examine the brain functioning of children and adolescent
      with OCD before and after treatment with Exposure and Response Prevention (EXRP) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The capacity to coordinate thoughts and actions to execute goal-directed behaviors
      (cognitive control) and the capacity to anticipate, respond to, and learn from reward
      (reward processing) are key processes for human behavior. Dysfunction in these processes has
      been hypothesized to contribute to repetitive thoughts and behaviors in many disorders,
      including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and eating disorders.
      The investigators will use multimodal imaging to investigate neural circuits that support
      cognitive control and reward processing, using pediatric OCD as a model system. The
      short-term goal is to clarify how circuit-based abnormalities contribute to repetitive
      thoughts/behaviors; these data will inform future transdiagnostic studies. The long-term
      goal is to identify control and reward circuit-abnormalities as targets for new
      transdiagnostic treatments.
