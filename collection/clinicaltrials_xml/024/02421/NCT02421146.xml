    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine brain function before, during, and after the
      administration of tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation). The brain can perform its
      job well or poorly depending on many things. The investigators will be using computer tasks
      and paper and pencil questionnaires to measure the relationship between brain performance
      and the administration of tDCS. In addition, the study team will be using functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and related imaging techniques to see how your brain works
      and compare it with the results we collected from the paper and pencil questionnaires. This
      study will enroll both schizophrenia patients as well as healthy volunteers without any
      major psychiatric disorder or physical illness.

      This is a placebo condition controlled double blind randomized prospective study where the
      study team plan to acquire clinical, neurocognitive and imaging data in schizophrenia
      patients and healthy controls. The proposed schedule is shown on Figure 1. Those who are
      eligible for the study will be consented, and will be randomized into either group A or B.
      The length of the study is four weeks. Subjects in both groups will undergo the same
      procedure, except that while subjects from group A unbeknownst to them will receive only a
      sham stimulation of tDCS (placebo condition), the subjects from group B will receive real
      tDCS stimulation. Real tDCS stimulation will involve ten 20 minute stimulations daily (at 2
      mA anode over the left DLPFC while cathode over the right suborbital region) on 5 weekdays
      of two consecutive weeks, while sham will contain 20 minute sessions as well, but only the
      first minute will be with 2mA, then unbeknownst to the subject, the unblinded research
      assistant will turn off the stimulation. The subjects will be told that they can be given
      either a sham or real stimulation and will be asked at the end of the experiment to fill out
      a visual analog scale indicating their guess about being in the real or sham arm. Following
      the first two weeks of the study, there will be a follow up period of two weeks when no
      stimulation or sham will be administered. Subjects, raters, clinicians and most of the
      research persons will all be kept blind in regards to their placebo or stimulation status
      until the end of the study. Research persons analyzing neuroimgaing data will break
      blindness after subject leaves the study, to continuously monitor neuroimaging findings.
