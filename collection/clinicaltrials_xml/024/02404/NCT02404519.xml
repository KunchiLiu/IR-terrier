  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin K is required for the activation of the inhibitor of vascular calcification: Matrix
      Gla Protein (MGP). In an earlier study the beneficial effect of menaquinone-7 (MK-7), a
      vitamin K2 form, was observed on the stiffness of the vessel wall in postmenopausal women.
      It decreased the circulating form of inactive MGP and improved the vascular elasticity
      (local) and aortic pulse wave velocity (regional). The decrease of circulating inactive MGP
      was observed after 2-3 months MK-7 supplementation and the effect of MK-7 on the clinical
      endpoints was observed within 3 years of supplementation. It is demonstrated in several
      studies that cardiovascular risk increases with decreasing vitamin K intake and increasing
      levels of inactive MGP. In this study the investigators select subjects in the highest
      tertile of circulating inactive MGP. This study group will consist of subjects with
      increased cardiovascular risk and it is expected that effects of MK-7 on clinical endpoints
      in this group will be measurable within 1 year of supplementation.

      This study will be a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled intervention study. In total
      240 healthy men and women between 40 and 70 years will be recruited in the province of
      Limburg through small advertisements in local newspapers.

      Eligible participants will be randomized into 2 study groups:

        -  Group 1: MK-7 (1 tablet: MK-7 dosage is 180 μg)

        -  Group 2: Placebo (1 tablet: MK-7 dosage is 0 µg) Each group will consist of 120
           participants. A double-blind design is chosen to avoid the occurrence of bias during
           the study. After randomization, the participants consume the placebo or MK-7 tablets
           once daily with either breakfast or dinner during one year.

      People who are interested to participate will come to the research laboratory of VitaK for a
      screening visit (day -14). During this visit, the investigator will check whether the
      volunteers are eligible for inclusion based on the in- and exclusion criteria. After meeting
      the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, volunteers will be assigned a
      randomization number from a computer-generated randomization list. A stratified block
      randomization will be performed for gender, in order to avoid unequal distribution of men
      and women among the 2 treatment groups.

      On-site measurements will be performed at t=0 and after 1 year of treatment: the
      carotid-femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (cfPWV; primary outcome) and echotracking of the common
      carotid artery to assess the vascular stiffness (secondary outcome). A Whole Body scan with
      DXA will be performed to determine total fat and lean mass of the participants. Blood will
      be taken after an overnight fasting period at t=0 and after 1 year to measure the
      circulating level of inactive MGP.

      Results from our previous study (NCT00642551) showed significant changes in vascular
      characteristics, pulse wave velocity after a 3 year intervention period with a daily dosage
      of 180 µg MK-7 in 240 postmenopausal women. After 1 year MK-7 intervention inactive MGP
      levels (improvement of vascular vitamin K status) were decreased 50% compared to placebo and
      remained at this level during the following 2 years of intervention.

      Recently published population-based studies show that the unfavorable cardiovascular
      outcomes are mainly attributable to those within the highest quartile of circulating
      dp-ucMGP. We expect, therefore, that an intervention study among preselected subjects with
      poor vascular vitamin K status (inactive MGP levels &gt; 500 pmol/L) and treatment with the
      same dosage MK-7 (i.e. 180 µg/day) during one year will have a more pronounced effect on
      arterial stiffening and pulse wave velocity.
