    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how two doses of Flunisolide HFA (an FDA approved
      inhaled medication to treat asthma) affect the small airways in children with asthma.

      This is a prospective, randomized, parallel, open label study. The primary aim is to compare
      the average change in spirometric values (Forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) and Forced
      Expiratory Flow 25-75% (FEF 25-75%) and Impulse Oscillometry System (IOS) values (Resistance
      at 5 Hz (R5), Resistance at 20 Hz (R20), Area of reactance (AX), Resonant frequency (Fres))
      from baseline to week 6 from participants randomized flunisolide hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) 1
      inhalation BID and to flunisolide HFA 2 inhalations BID. The change in scores from baseline
      to six week follow up will initially be compared using paired t-tests and Chi-squared tests
      for trend. Repeated measurements will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects
      regression modeling (GLMM) techniques. For continuous outcomes (e.g. FEV1, FEF 25-75%, Fres,
      reactance at 5 Hz (X5), AX, R5-R20). The identity link function and normal distribution will
      be used. For count data (e.g., use of Beta-agonists, episodes of coughing, episodes of
      wheezing, etc.) the log link function and the Poisson distribution will be used. If we
      dichotomize outcomes (e.g., a Beta-agonist was used, coughing occurred, etc.) the logit link
      function and Bernoulli distribution will be used.
