      This is a Phase 2/3, long term, open‑label, follow‑up study. Subjects will have previously
      participated in qualifying/index JIA studies of tofacitinib. Those who have already
      completed such participation and enroll outside the 14 day window following completion of
      the End of Study (EOS) Visit of the qualifying/index study will participate in a screening
      Visit to determine eligibility. A Baseline Visit will then occur within 28 days after the
      Screening Visit. For subjects who are completing participation in a qualifying study of
      tofacitinib and enrolling on the same day of the EOS Visit of the qualifying/index study,
      the EOS Visit of the qualifying/index study can be combined with the Screening and Baseline
      Visits for this study. The subjects who enroll within the 14 day window following completion
      of the EOS Visit of the qualifying/index study will participate in a combined Screening and
      Baseline Visit for this study. After the Baseline Visit, visits will occur at 1 month (1
      month=30 days) and 3 months, then every 3 months thereafter as long as the subject remains
      in the study.

      Approximately 290 participants are projected to enroll into this open label extension study
      after completing a qualifying/index study in the JIA program.

      This study (A3921145) is planned to run until the first global marketing approval of
      tofacitinib for the treatment of JIA. The total duration of an individual subject's
      participation may vary depending upon when they enter the trial.

          -  Pediatric subjects with JIA aged from 2 to less than 18 years who met entry criteria
             for the qualifying/index study and in the opinion of the investigator have sufficient
             evidence of JIA disease activity to warrant use of tofacitinib as a DMARD. Subjects
             turning 18 years of age during participation in the qualifying/index study or
             subsequently will be eligible for participation in this study.

          -  The subject has discontinued disallowed concomitant medications for the required time
             prior to the first dose of study drug, as defined in Appendix 1, and is taking only
             those concomitant medications in doses and frequency allowed by the protocol.

          -  Fertile male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential who are, in the
             opinion of the investigator, sexually active and at risk for pregnancy with their
             partner(s) must be using a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in
             this protocol throughout the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of
             study medication.

          -  Subjects must have previously completed participation in a qualifying study of
             tofacitinib for the treatment of JIA. Subjects who have required earlier
             discontinuation of treatment in a qualifying study for reasons other than tofacitinib
             related serious adverse events may be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Systemic JIA (sJIA) with active systemic features other than active joints and
             elevated acute phase reactants, persistent oligoarthritis, and undifferentiated JIA.

          -  Infections:

               1. Chronic infections.

               2. Any infection requiring hospitalization, parenteral antimicrobial therapy or
                  judged to be opportunistic by the investigator within the 6 months prior to the
                  first dose of study drug.

               3. Any treated infections within 2 weeks of baseline visit.

               4. A subject known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
                  hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus.

               5. History of infected joint prosthesis with prosthesis still in situ.

          -  History of recurrent (more than one episode) herpes zoster or disseminated (a single
             episode) herpes zoster or disseminated (a single episode) herpes simplex.
