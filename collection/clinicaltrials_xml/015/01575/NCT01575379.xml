  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that serum uric acid levels higher
      than average predispose diabetic patients to kidney damage. The purpose of this study is to
      gather preliminary information on whether lowering serum uric acid by means of oral
      allopurinol (a drug commonly used for the treatment of gout) can be used to prevent or delay
      the loss of kidney function that may accompany diabetes. The results of this study will help
      us design a larger study to find out whether this medication can prevent kidney problems, in
      particular the loss of kidney function, in people with type 1 diabetes.

    <description>The allopurinol dosage will vary from 200 to 400 mg per day based on GFR. Subjects randomized to allopurinol will initially take 100 mg per day for four weeks. After that, they will be switched to 400 mg per day if their GFR is ≥50 ml/min/1.73 m2, 300 mg per day if their GFR is in the 25-50 ml/min/1.73 m2 range, and 200 mg per day if the GFR is in the 15-25 ml/min/1.73 m2 range. Allopurinol will be continued at this dosage throughout the study unless the GFR changes, in which case the dosage will be modified to that appropriate for the new GFR class.Subjects will be given four tablets per day to be taken orally following meals, two in the morning and two in the evening. A dosage of 100 mg will be given as a 100 mg tablet plus three placebo tablets, 200 mg as two 100 mg and two placebo tablets, 300 mg as three 100 mg and one placebo tablet, 400 mg as four 100 mg tablets. Subjects randomized to placebo will be given four placebo tablets.</description>
