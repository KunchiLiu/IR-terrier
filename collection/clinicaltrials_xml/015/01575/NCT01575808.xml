    <textblock>
      The utility of GP1101 will be evaluated relative to that of surgical bypass in the treatment
      of Femoral/Popliteal Arterial Symptomatic Peripheral Arterial Disease. Efficacy will be
      measured by comparison to a Surgical Bypass Efficacy Goal, and Invasiveness will be measured
      by comparison to Surgical Bypass data derived from a retrospective study.
