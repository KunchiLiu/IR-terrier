    <measure>Fibrinogen Activity Normalized Area Under the Curve Standardized</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 144, 216, and 312 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Fibrinogen activity was determined via a validated Clauss assay (fibrinogen activity) and fibrinogen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ie, fibrinogen antigen) using paired antibodies for fibrinogen antigen. All determinations were performed on frozen plasma samples in a central laboratory. The Clauss assay was modified and validated to achieve a limit of quantification of 0.2 g/L. The pharmacokinetic analysis was assessed individually using a non-compartmental model. Plasma levels were measured at Baseline, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 144, 216, and 312 hours post-treatment. The normalized area under the curve was standardized to a dose of 70 mg/kg.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of Maximum Clot Firmness Between Octafibrin and Haemocomplettan P/RiaSTAP at 1 hr Post Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 hour post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Thromboelastography (TEG) using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) was used to measure maximum clot firmness. Rotational thromboelastometry is a method for the continuous measurement of clot formation. Maximum clot firmness is a functional parameter that depends on the activation of coagulation, the platelet and fibrinogen content of the blood sample, and the polymerisation and cross-linking of the fibrin network. In order to obtain comparable results from all study centres, maximum clot firmness data were assessed from frozen citrated plasma samples in a central laboratory. As these samples did not contain platelets that would be found in the whole blood assay, only the fibrinogen content defined the maximum clot firmness.</description>

    <description>Incremental in vivo recovery was calculated as the maximum increase in plasma fibrinogen (fibrinogen activity assay data) within 4 hours post-treatment as compared with pre-treatment (expressed as an absolute mg/dL concentration in plasma), divided by the exact dose of Octafibrin or Haemocomplettan® P or RiaSTAPTM (expressed as mg/kg dosed).</description>

        <title>Fibrinogen Activity Normalized Area Under the Curve Standardized</title>
        <description>Fibrinogen activity was determined via a validated Clauss assay (fibrinogen activity) and fibrinogen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ie, fibrinogen antigen) using paired antibodies for fibrinogen antigen. All determinations were performed on frozen plasma samples in a central laboratory. The Clauss assay was modified and validated to achieve a limit of quantification of 0.2 g/L. The pharmacokinetic analysis was assessed individually using a non-compartmental model. Plasma levels were measured at Baseline, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 144, 216, and 312 hours post-treatment. The normalized area under the curve was standardized to a dose of 70 mg/kg.</description>

          <title>Fibrinogen Activity Normalized Area Under the Curve Standardized</title>
          <description>Fibrinogen activity was determined via a validated Clauss assay (fibrinogen activity) and fibrinogen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ie, fibrinogen antigen) using paired antibodies for fibrinogen antigen. All determinations were performed on frozen plasma samples in a central laboratory. The Clauss assay was modified and validated to achieve a limit of quantification of 0.2 g/L. The pharmacokinetic analysis was assessed individually using a non-compartmental model. Plasma levels were measured at Baseline, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 144, 216, and 312 hours post-treatment. The normalized area under the curve was standardized to a dose of 70 mg/kg.</description>

        <title>Comparison of Maximum Clot Firmness Between Octafibrin and Haemocomplettan P/RiaSTAP at 1 hr Post Infusion</title>
        <description>Thromboelastography (TEG) using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) was used to measure maximum clot firmness. Rotational thromboelastometry is a method for the continuous measurement of clot formation. Maximum clot firmness is a functional parameter that depends on the activation of coagulation, the platelet and fibrinogen content of the blood sample, and the polymerisation and cross-linking of the fibrin network. In order to obtain comparable results from all study centres, maximum clot firmness data were assessed from frozen citrated plasma samples in a central laboratory. As these samples did not contain platelets that would be found in the whole blood assay, only the fibrinogen content defined the maximum clot firmness.</description>
