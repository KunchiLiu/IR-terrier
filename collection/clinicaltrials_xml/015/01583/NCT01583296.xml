  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research plan involves two aims: 1) Cultural adaptation of the Panic-Asthma Treatment
      and 2) a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study. Participants will be primarily
      recruited from two major, inner-city hospitals in the Bronx, NY. Diagnosis of Panic Disorder
      (PD) will be based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Diagnosis of asthma will
      be based on national guidelines. The first year of the project will be devoted to
      approximately 5 focus groups with Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) participants, pilot
      treatment and participant feedback. The protocol will be adapted based on key cultural
      issues that are systematically observed during Phase 1. During Years 2-3, 40 participants
      with PD and asthma will be randomized into two treatment arms: Panic-Asthma Treatment and an
      active placebo condition involving music therapy and paced breathing at resting respiration
      rates. Each treatment will involve 8 weekly sessions. An interviewer, who will be blind to
      treatment condition, will conduct assessments at pre-treatment, mid-treatment,
      post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. The primary hypotheses are that participants in the
      Panic-Asthma treatment group will have greater decreases than subjects in the placebo
      condition on the PD severity scale and albuterol use (i.e., rescue asthma medication) from
      pre-test to post-test and across 3-month follow-up.
