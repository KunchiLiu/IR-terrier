      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial to test the efficacy of Olaparib in adult
      participants with recurrent/metastatic Ewing's Sarcoma following failure of prior
      chemotherapy.

      Primary Objectives Evaluate the objective response rate of olaparib in adult patients with
      recurrent and/or metastatic Ewing's sarcoma following failure of conventional chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate the progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety
      of olaparib in this patient population. As an exploratory objective, the investigators will
      evaluate (in subjects who agree to an optional biopsy) differences in pre- and
      post-treatment tumor DNA alterations and differences in levels of protein and RNA expression
      related to PARP inhibition.

      Study Design Potential subjects who discuss and sign the informed consent form will undergo
      screening studies. Eligible patients will administer olaparib and obtain restaging imaging
      studies after 6 and 12 weeks on study, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Participants will
      remain on study drug until disease progression, onset of unacceptable toxicities, or subject
      withdraws consent.
