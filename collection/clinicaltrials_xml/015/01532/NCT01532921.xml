    <textblock>
      Few clinical evidence for the Contour 3D Tricuspid Annuloplasty Ring exists; therefore, in
      order to position this product on the market, a post-market release study will be completed.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hemodynamic performance of the Contour 3D®
      Tricuspid Annuloplasty Ring following Tricuspid Valve repair in a post-market environment.

        The patient population includes all patients indicated for a TV repair procedure
        concomitantly to left-sided heart surgery, and for which the surgeon considers the
        implantation of a Contour 3D® Tricuspid Annuloplasty Ring most appropriate to reconstruct
        the diseased valve. Patients with primary TV are not included, since this is often
        characterized by pathological leaflets for which the Contour 3D® Tricuspid Annuloplasty
        Ring would not be beneficial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Indicated for a concomitant surgical repair of the TV

          -  Willing to return to the hospital, where the implantation originally occurred, for a
             6 month follow-up visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a degenerative TV condition

          -  Stand-alone TV repair

          -  Already participating in another investigational device or drug study, possibly
             leading to bias and jeopardizing the scientific appropriate assessment of the study
             endpoints

          -  Life expectancy of less than one year

          -  Pregnant or desire to be pregnant within 12 months of the study treatment
