      This research is being done to study the effectiveness of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) to
      modify hepcidin levels in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anemia is a common
      problem in children with CKD. Anemia is when the body does not have enough healthy red blood
      cells. Hepcidin is a protein in the blood which interferes with the body's production of red
      blood cells. This study will see if vitamin D lowers hepcidin levels in children and young
      adults with CKD. If so, it could be used as an additional treatment for anemia in these
      children, in addition to the current therapies already in use including iron supplements and
      erythropoietin. People between the ages of 1 and 21 with CKD may be considered for this
      study.

      Vitamin D Supplementation is a practical and inexpensive intervention which is safe, readily
      available and clinically indicated. Substantial recent evidence suggests vitamin D may
      modify inflammatory pathways in CKD. There is a high probability of benefit and a low
      probability of harm for this easily modifiable factor. 25D levels can be effectively
      modified through oral supplementation with cholecalciferol. To the best of our knowledge, no
      studies examining the effects of oral cholecalciferol supplementation on hepcidin levels
      have been conducted in children with either CKD or other diseases.

      We will conduct a randomized open-label controlled trial of oral cholecalciferol
      supplementation in children aged 1-21 years with stage 2-5 (pre-dialysis) CKD receiving
      regular nephrology follow-up at a tertiary-care children's hospital (Johns Hopkins
      Children's Center). The intervention model will be parallel assignment. Children will be
      randomly allocated to receive either cholecalciferol supplementation 4000 IU per day (28,000
      IU weekly) according to the KDOQI recommended supplementation for children with mild 25D
      deficiency, or will be treated with 400 IU/day (2,800 IU/weekly), which is the recommended
      dietary allowance.(1) Allocation will be double-blinded to prevent knowledge of allocation
      status affecting interpretation of results. Study participants will be prescribed any
      clinically indicated additional cholecalciferol supplementation once the 3-month laboratory
      measures have been obtained, based on serum 25D levels at the end of the study period.(1) We
      are proposing a supplementation dose of 4000 IU/day in children with CKD, which is
      considered a safe dose by KDOQI standards; vitamin D2 doses as high as 10,000 IU/day have
      been given to French patients with CKD for &gt; 1 year with no evidence of vitamin D
      toxicity.(2) 25D levels between 40 and 80 are indicative of &quot;sufficiency&quot;, and a safe upper
      limit of intake, in which the risk of hypercalcemia is negligible, has been defined as
      10,000 IU/day.(3, 4) Cholecalciferol will be provided in both tablet (vitamin D 2000 IU
      tablets and 400 IU tablets, National Vitamin Company, Casa Grande, AZ) and liquid (Enfamil®
      D-Vi-Sol™ Drops, 400 IU per mL) form, based on the ability to tolerate and preference of the
      subject.

      Participants will be monitored for signs of 25D toxicity (hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia,
      hypercalciuria) during the follow up period of 1 month and 3 months from baseline.

      Data Safety Monitoring Board will review serum calcium, phosphorus, and urine
      calcium:creatinine ratio values at the one month visit; if subjects show evidence of
      hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia (serum values &gt; upper limit of normal, age-specific
      values, see Table 3 below), study drug will be discontinued.(3) If subjects demonstrate
      evidence of hypercalciuria (urine calcium:cr ratio &gt; 0.6 in 1-2 year olds or &gt; 0.2 in &gt; 2
      year olds) study drug will be discontinued.(5) In addition, if 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels &gt;
      80 ng/mL are reached, the study drug will be discontinued. In any subject in whom study drug
      is discontinued, the 3-month laboratory data will still be collected.

      In the case of hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dL) corrected total serum calcium will
      be calculated using the formula: Corrected calcium (mg/dL) = serum calcium (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4
      - serum albumin [g/dL])(2) Standardized blood pressure measurement will include three manual
      BP measurements conducted after five minutes of rest with an aneroid sphygmomanometer, at
      least 30 seconds apart.
