  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health care benefits and services are received through the Veterans Health Administration
      (VHA), a component of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Over 40,000 Veterans
      across the Veterans Health Administration are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), a
      chronic condition that affects motor function as well as cognition, mood, sleep, and
      autonomic function. There are not enough subspecialists to manage every Veteran with
      Parkinson's disease. However, a care model of nurse care managers as catalysts and advocates
      using needs assessments, evidence-based protocols, and VHA and community access coordination
      mechanisms to optimize Parkinson's disease care may improve quality of Parkinson's disease
      care and patient-centered outcomes. If efficacious, this model may be practical to
      disseminate via an existing VHA national consortium network for Parkinson's disease.

      Objectives are (1) to implement then analyze via a randomized controlled trial whether a
      nurse-led, coordinated care management intervention, Care Coordination for Health Promotion
      and Activities in Parkinson's Disease (CHAPS), compared to usual care will improve adherence
      to evidence-based practice guidelines and improve health outcomes in Veterans with
      Parkinson's disease in a region of the southwest United States, and (2) to analyze extent of
      implementation of the CHAPS intervention and its costs to determine how the intervention can
      be made sustainable and disseminated throughout Veterans Affairs Medical Centers if
      efficacious.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A series of investigations on Parkinson's disease (PD), following the Veterans Affairs
      Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (VA QUERI) process, have been conducted by the
      investigators' research team. This work has (1) developed and updated a comprehensive set of
      evidence-based quality indicators for PD care, (2) documented gaps in Veterans Health
      Administration-delivered care relative to these indicators, and (3) identified variations in
      care and factors associated with those variations. Under the Veterans Affairs Health
      Services Research and Development Nursing Research Initiative pilot study, the Task Force of
      several Veterans Health Administration and community champions including key clinicians
      treating patients with PD at VA Medical Centers in Los Angeles, Loma Linda, Long Beach, and
      San Diego, California; and Las Vegas, Nevada) and advocates from five local PD resource
      groups convened, developed, and refined assessment tools and protocols to achieve adherence
      to a set of 38 Parkinson's disease indicators ranked highest priority by the Task Force. A
      total of 26 Veterans with PD enrolled in the pilot study. Project staff administered the
      newly-developed PD quality improvement assessment tools to these veterans. Staff and
      enrolled Veterans provided ongoing feedback to refine the tools.

      In a 5-year randomized controlled trial, a total of 345 Veterans with PD have been recruited
      and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receiving 18 months of a PD care management intervention,
      &quot;Care Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease&quot; (CHAPS) or
      usual care. Eligible participants at Greater Los Angeles (GLA), Las Vegas, Loma Linda, Long
      Beach and San Diego VISN 22 (VA Desert Pacific Healthcare Network) facilities are being
      identified through administrative data and vetted by physicians. The 18-month multi-faceted
      nurse-led intervention incorporates PD quality improvement (QI) tools to enhance proactive
      patient-centered care delivery. PDQI tools include a structured telephone assessment
      administered by a nurse to identify medical problems and unmet needs; problem-specific
      evidence-based interventions organized into treatment plans including follow-up/monitoring
      protocols; message templates and patient notebooks (Siebens Health Care Notebooks) to enrich
      communication with providers; protocols to engage patients, families, and the community to
      enhance VA and community care for affected Veterans; Veteran self-management materials; and
      a care management workflow MS Access database programmed with these care coordination tools.
      Research interviewers, blinded to randomization status, survey participants by telephone at
      baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. The first 204 participants will be administered a 24-month
      survey to account for a delay in intervention implementation during Year 2. Study
      participants are thanked for their time to completed the surveys. Medical records will be
      abstracted at 18 months. Analyses will be conducted to measure quality indicator adherence,
      health outcomes, and health service utilization. A process evaluation to gain perspectives
      on implementation strengths and weaknesses, and a cost analysis to assess relationships
      between costs and program outcomes will be conducted, providing new knowledge to aid in
      future dissemination of the CHAPS program in a &quot;National Rollout&quot; according to the VA
      Quality Enhancement Research Initiative QUERI process.

    <description>Guidelines for Parkinson's disease (PD) care are measureable, evidence-based indicators of PD care offered/delivered to patients. Guideline adherence is expressed as the mean across the study participant group of the per-patient percentage of applicable guideline measures for which there was adherence. (An applicable PD guideline is one for which a participant is eligible).</description>

    <description>The Health Utilities Index (HUI) has been used in many clinical studies covering a wide range of health problems. HUI questionnaires are effective tools used to measure health status, report health-related quality of life (HRQL), and produce utility scores (ranging from 0=death to 1= perfect health) that can be used in formal cost-effectiveness analyses. The HUI provides comprehensive, reliable and valid measures of health status and HRQL.</description>

    <description>General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) The GSES is a 10-item scale that assesses perceived self-efficacy (i.e. the belief that one's actions are responsible for successful outcomes) regarding coping and adaptation abilities in both daily activities and isolated stressful events. The scaled score for each question ranges from 1 to 4. Higher scores indicate that the patient demonstrates a stronger belief in self efficacy.

The PHQ-9 incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria with other major depressive symptoms into a brief self report tool. There are two components of the PHQ-9; assessing symptoms and functional impairment to make an initial depression diagnosis and obtaining a severity score to help select and monitor treatment. The PHQ-9 performed comparably to the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) in identifying depression among primary care elderly.</description>
