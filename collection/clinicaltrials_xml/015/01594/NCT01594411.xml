      This is a prospective, multi-center study examining the clinical impact of the Corus® CAD
      assay in approximately 250 evaluable subjects with no history of obstructive coronary artery
      disease who now present with chest pain or anginal-equivalent symptoms to a primary care
      physician (PCP) for evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In symptomatic patients with or without prior cardiac testing, the PCP will initially decide
      the subject's pretest probability for coronary artery disease (CAD) based on the subject's
      risk factors and quality of chest pain (typical or atypical), or anginal equivalent (e.g.,
      jaw, arm pain, or unexplained shortness of breath) and consider the results of prior
      testing, if applicable. The initial questionnaire will capture the PCP's initial clinical
      impression and decision ('preliminary decision') on how to further evaluate and manage the
      patient. A Corus® CAD assay will be performed at the PCP's office. After the PCP has
      received the Corus® CAD result (approximately 2-3 days later), the PCP will decide on the
      appropriate evaluation and management of the patient ('final decision') using the Corus® CAD
      result in conjunction with his/her clinical impression and/or other clinical data available.
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether the Corus® CAD test results is
      associated with a change in the PCPs' diagnostic evaluation and management of patients as
      compared to their initial testing and treatment decisions.

      Since it takes approximately two days for the physician to receive the result of the Corus®
      CAD, symptomatic subjects with unstable angina, or suspicion for myocardial infarction will
      be excluded from the study.

      A follow-up phone call and a detailed questionnaire will be performed at 30 + 15 days, from
      the time of blood draw, to assess the triage decision, such as referral to any
      subspecialists (cardiologist, gastroenterologist, and pulmonologist), cardiac diagnostic
      tests performed, cardiac procedures performed, and results of these cardiac tests and
      procedures.

    <description>The primary objective was to assess whether the Gene Expression Score (GES) altered clinicians' evaluations, defined by a change in patient management from preliminary to final decision. The change was prospectively defined as a downgrade or upgrade in intensity of the diagnostic plan based on the following hierarchical categories:(1) no further cardiac testing or treatment, (2) lifestyle changes or medical therapy, (3) stress testing (with or without imaging) or computed tomography/coronary angiography, or (4) invasive coronary angiography. The GES algorithm comprises expression values for 23 genes from peripheral blood cells in 6 terms, patient age, and sex. The changes in gene expression are quantified using an algorithm that generates a GES ranging from 1 to 40. A score &lt;=15 indicates a low risk of underlying obstructive coronary disease. The GES has a negative predictive value of 96% for GES &lt;=15 in a popluation referred to myocardial perfusion imaging.</description>

        <title>Change in Clinicians' Treatment Decision After Gene Expression Testing</title>
        <description>The primary objective was to assess whether the Gene Expression Score (GES) altered clinicians' evaluations, defined by a change in patient management from preliminary to final decision. The change was prospectively defined as a downgrade or upgrade in intensity of the diagnostic plan based on the following hierarchical categories:(1) no further cardiac testing or treatment, (2) lifestyle changes or medical therapy, (3) stress testing (with or without imaging) or computed tomography/coronary angiography, or (4) invasive coronary angiography. The GES algorithm comprises expression values for 23 genes from peripheral blood cells in 6 terms, patient age, and sex. The changes in gene expression are quantified using an algorithm that generates a GES ranging from 1 to 40. A score &lt;=15 indicates a low risk of underlying obstructive coronary disease. The GES has a negative predictive value of 96% for GES &lt;=15 in a popluation referred to myocardial perfusion imaging.</description>

        <population>The study sites included 9 clinicians at 4 community-based primary care practices who assessed all participants with a valid GES.</population>

          <title>Change in Clinicians' Treatment Decision After Gene Expression Testing</title>
          <description>The primary objective was to assess whether the Gene Expression Score (GES) altered clinicians' evaluations, defined by a change in patient management from preliminary to final decision. The change was prospectively defined as a downgrade or upgrade in intensity of the diagnostic plan based on the following hierarchical categories:(1) no further cardiac testing or treatment, (2) lifestyle changes or medical therapy, (3) stress testing (with or without imaging) or computed tomography/coronary angiography, or (4) invasive coronary angiography. The GES algorithm comprises expression values for 23 genes from peripheral blood cells in 6 terms, patient age, and sex. The changes in gene expression are quantified using an algorithm that generates a GES ranging from 1 to 40. A score &lt;=15 indicates a low risk of underlying obstructive coronary disease. The GES has a negative predictive value of 96% for GES &lt;=15 in a popluation referred to myocardial perfusion imaging.</description>
          <population>The study sites included 9 clinicians at 4 community-based primary care practices who assessed all participants with a valid GES.</population>
