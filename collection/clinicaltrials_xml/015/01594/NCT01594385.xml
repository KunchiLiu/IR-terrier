  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the effects of Seprafilm adhesion barrier on patients who
      are undergoing open abdomen damage control management for traumatic injuries when compared
      to no adhesion barrier use. Specifically, the researchers wish to study the effects of
      Seprafilm adhesion barrier on:

        -  the number and intensity of adhesions,

        -  whether there is any difference between treatment groups (Seprafilm vs. no Seprafilm)
           who go on to successful definitive abdominal closure,

        -  rate of occurrence of secondary complications (such as abscesses) associated with
           short- and long-term beneficial effects of reducing adhesion formation,and

        -  whether there is any difference between treatment groups regarding patient functional
           recovery.

      Data to be analyzed includes:

      Age, gender, traumatic injuries, trauma alert level, procedure information, length of
      hospital stay, length of ICU stay, interval between admission and initial operation,
      interval between operations, whether operation took place during the day or night, duration
      of operation in minutes, number of surgeons present during the operation, description of the
      initial operation, justification for using damage control approach, complications noted,
      injuries missed or delayed in diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II

      time points, subject randomization information, number of operations, adhesion scores
      (Zuhlke and Yaacobi) for each operative procedure, contamination score for each operative
      procedure, diagnosis and description of sub-procedures for each operative procedure, wound
      characteristics from the start and end of all operative procedures (e.g. length and width of
      the fascia and skin), type of abdominal coverage or closure, discharge destination (e.g.
      home, short term rehabilitation facility, etc.), Functional Outcome Measure score, Glasgow

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed until their open abdomen is closed. Depending on the nature and severity of the wound, this period may last as long as 1 year after the patient has been discharged.</time_frame>
    <description>There will not be a fixed duration of outpatient follow-up (fixed follow-up in trauma patients is not practical due to the unpredictable nature of trauma population), an average (mean) follow-up will be determined for the entire cohort of patients for the purposes of the study, up to a maximum of 1 year (if available) following hospital discharge.</description>

    <description>Patients undergoing surgery in either arm of the study will be assessed for severity of intra-abdominal adhesions during each return trip to the operating room. Any patients taken back to the operating room for up to 1 year will be assessed for adhesion severity.</description>

    <description>Two sheets of the Seprafilm material will be applied at each reoperation. Each sheet will be cut into 1x1 inch squares and applied to the following anatomic areas:
Two Seprafilm pieces between the liver and the anterior abdominal wall
Four pieces over the exposed bowel surfaces anteriorly
Two slightly staggered pieces of Seprafilm in each colic gutter
Two pieces in the pelvic area.
If any of the above areas involve an anastomosis or bowel repair, then the Seprafilm should be placed at least 1 inch away from the anastomosis and/or bowel repair.</description>
