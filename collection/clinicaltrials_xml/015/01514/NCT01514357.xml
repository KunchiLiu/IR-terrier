    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is two fold: First the investigators want to determine the safe and
      most effective dose of subcutaneous (SQ) BNP in subjects with resistant hypertension.
      Second, the investigators want to demonstrate efficacy of chronically (one week)
      administered SQ BNP in resistant hypertension in reducing blood pressure.

    <textblock>
      Hypertension remains a global burden in cardiovascular disease leading to stroke, myocardial
      infarction, and heart failure. Its myocardial complications result from increased mechanical
      load on the heart. Under physiological conditions of increased myocardial load and resulting
      myocardial stretch, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
      synthesis and secretion occur contributing to maintenance of optimal cardiorenal and blood
      pressure homeostasis. However, studies indicate that in subjects with cardiovascular
      diseases the biological structure of these hormones may be altered, thus reducing their
      favorable protective activities. New studies indicate that early and moderate hypertension
      is associated with a derangement of the natriuretic peptide system which is characterized by
      the lack of activation of biologically active ANP and BNP, while severe hypertension is
      characterized by cardiac release of altered molecular forms of ANP and BNP that have reduced
      biological properties and/or enhanced degradation.

      The broad objective of proposal is to advance the biology and therapeutics of the
      natriuretic peptides (NPs) with a special focus on the cardiac peptide BNP in human
      hypertension. Our proposal is based upon the biological properties of BNP (i.e.,
      natriuretic, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone suppressing, vasodilating, anti-fibrotic,
      anti-hypertrophic and positive lusitropic), its mechanistic role in human hypertension, and
      thus its potential as an innovative chronic protein therapeutic to enhance the treatment of
      patients with uncontrolled and or resistant hypertension. Importantly, BNP is an endocrine
      hormone normally produced by the human heart, and its use as therapeutic agent has been
      approved in USA for more than a decade and has been proven to be safe.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the change in BP with treatment over 7 days. This will be assessed by the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) recordings performed at baseline (day 0) and at day 6 (post-treatment). Group comparisons will be based on the overall (24-hour) mean, the daytime mean, and the night-time mean.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Renal function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 7 days treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoints will include renal function as assessed by calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and cystatin-C, effects of SQ BNP on 24-hour sodium excretion.</description>

    <measure>Hormonal changes</measure>

    <description>The effects upon the endogenous NPs system determined by changes in ANP, NT-ANP, proBNP1-108, NT-proBNP, cyclic guanylate monophosphate (cGMP), and suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) will also be assessed.</description>
