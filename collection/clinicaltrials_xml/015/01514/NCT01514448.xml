  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) who have failed first-line therapy with
      sunitinib or pazopanib will be treated with everolimus. Efficacy and safety of everolimus
      will be evaluated in theses patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of patients progression-free after 6 months of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoint is proportion of patients progression-free by month 6 after starting everolimus treatment. A 'responder' will be defined as a subject without progression by month 6 whereas a 'non-responder' will be defined as a subject with progressive disease by month 6. The primary variable will be derived from radiologic tumor assessments according to RECIST 1.1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival as the time interval between first intake of everolimus and first documented disease progression or death due to any cause</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Every 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is the time from date of start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, progression-free survival is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival of patients treated with everolimus after failure of first-line sunitinib or pazopanib therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of start of treatment to date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival will be censored at the date of last contact.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate in patients treated with everolimus after failure of first-line sunitinib or pazopanib therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator's best overall response rate (ORR) is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by month 6. ORR will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response in patients treated with everolimus after failure of first-line sunitinib or pazopanib therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Every 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response (CR or PR) is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a confirmed CR or PR (as per investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1) until the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to underlying cancer. If a patient has not had an event or when they receive any further anticancer therapy, duration of overall response is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. Duration of response will be displayed only for patients whose best overall response was CR or PR</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of everolimus after failure of first-line sunitinib or pazopanib therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Every 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of safety will be based mainly on frequency of adverse events and on the number of laboratory values that fall outside of pre-determined ranges. Other safety data (e.g., electrocardiogram, vital signs) will be considered as appropriate. All safety data will be listed. The safety summary tables will only include assessments collected no later than 28 days after study treatment discontinuation. All safety assessments will be listed and those collected later than 28 days after study treatment discontinuation will be flagged.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>62 evaluable patients who have progressed during or after first-line therapy with sunitinib or pazopanib will be enrolled: patients previously treated with first-line sunitinib (group 1) and 31 patients previously treated with first-line pazopanib (group 2). The protocol consists of two independent single-arm, single-stage trial run in the following groups: group 1 (patients previously treated with first-line sunitinib for mRCC) and group 2 (patients previously treated with first-line pazopanib for mRCC). The efficacy and safety of everolimus will be analyzed separately in each group. Patients who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be treated with everolimus 10 mg daily until disease progression, occurrence of intolerable toxicity, start of another anticancer treatment or withdrawn consent.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Everolimus</intervention_name>
    <description>Everolimus will be prescribed by the investigator. Everolimus will be used as commercially available tablets of 10 mg strength and 5 mg strength for dose modifications. On the first day of each cycle, patients will receive a prescription of an adequate drug supply for self-administration at home. The investigator must emphasize compliance and will instruct the patient to take everolimus exactly as prescribed.</description>

             confirmation of clear cell renal carcinoma.

          -  Progression during or after a treatment with sunitinib or pazopanib given in a 1st
             line treatment situation for mRCC.

          -  Patients who have previously received systemic mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus,
             temsirolimus, everolimus).

          -  Patients who are using other investigational agents or who had received
             investigational drugs â‰¤ 2 weeks prior to study treatment start.

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
