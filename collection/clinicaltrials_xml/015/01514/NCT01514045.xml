    <textblock>
      The Gastric Cancer Registry will combine data acquired directly from patients with gastric
      cancer via an online questionnaire with genomic data obtained from blood and tissue samples.
      The purpose of this registry is to gain better understanding of the causes of gastric
      cancer, both environmental and genetic; whether certain genomic data can predict outcomes of
      treatment and survival; as well as explore the issues that effect the quality of life of
      these patients after diagnosis and treatment.

      Collect detailed clinical and epidemiological information on patients with gastric tumors
      via an online registry and a detailed patient questionnaire. Participants can opt in to
      contribute a blood sample and paraffin block samples from previous surgery.
