  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the progression free survival in
      patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and in patients with locally advanced
      unresectable non-metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with a dose-attenuated modification of
      folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX). Secondary endpoints
      include: determine objective response rate according to RECIST; determine overall survival;
      evaluate toxicity; determine rate of resection in locally advanced unresectable stratum;
      correlate time to progression, objective response, and overall survival with early changes
      in glucose metabolism using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography
      (PET) scanning.
