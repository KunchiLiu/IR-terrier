  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 24-hour-a-day, 7-day a week, work-world arrived within our lifetimes, and is here to
      stay. Americans are working more and more, frequently at multiple jobs. The pattern of short
      sleep during the week followed by attempts to recover on the weekend is in common practice,
      but we know little of the associated health risks. What is the cost in terms of increasing
      known risk markers for cardiovascular disease, of repeated nights of insufficient sleep, and
      is this cost compounded with repetition, without adequate recovery? Evidence is accumulating
      to suggest that short sleep duration is linked to the development of metabolic and
      inflammation-associated diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. Mechanisms involved in the
      development of cardiovascular disease include impaired vascular function and inflammation.
      The current proposal is designed to investigate the effects of repeated periods of short
      nocturnal sleep duration in 4 cycles (each cycle consisting of 3 nights of 4 hours of sleep
      opportunity per night), and each cycle of short sleep followed by a single night of recovery
      sleep. Vascular reactivity will be assessed using brachial artery flow mediated dilation,
      and microcirculatory vasodilation will be assessed using perfusion imaging techniques. The
      dependence of IL-6 and sVCAM-1 as measured in peripheral circulation, on vascular function,
      will also be investigated.
