    <textblock>
      Asthma is a disease of rapidly increasing incidence that already affects more than 17
      million people in the United States alone. It has long been known that areas of severely
      reduced airflow occur in asthma and contribute significantly to the impairment of gas
      exchange in this disease. However, the extent to which local blood flow changes during an
      asthmatic attack is unclear. The purpose of this study is using PET-CT imaging to evaluate
      how the blood flow changes in the lungs during an asthma attack induced by allergens.

      Asthma is a disease of rapidly increasing incidence that already affects more than 17
      million people in the United States alone. It is of major importance to understand the
      mechanisms responsible for underlying mechanical and physiological changes that occur during
      asthma exacerbations. The effect of asthma on the pulmonary vasculature is virtually
      unknown. It has long been known that areas of severely reduced airflow occur in asthma and
      contribute significantly to the impairment of gas exchange in this disease. However, the
      extent to which local blood flow changes during an asthmatic attack is unclear. This
      proposal is designed to evaluate the relevance of potential mechanisms responsible for the
      blood flow defects seen in our PET studies of subjects with asthma and identify factors
      modifying that perfusion distribution. With this knowledge, it is hoped that a more focused
      basic research is motivated to understand the fundamental mechanisms behind these processes
      ultimately targeted to improved asthma therapy. Comparing these measures in healthy subjects
      and asthmatics patients may lead to methods to improve patient care.

    <description>The route of administration will be topical application of the titrated allergen via nebulized droplets to the lungs. The starting dose of allergen will be 3 dose dilutions below the estimated PC20-allergen delivered for 5 minutes at tidal breathing, followed by FEV1 at 10-minute intervals until the lowest FEV1 is established. If the %FEV1 fall is &lt; 20%, the next concentration is given, until the FEV1 falls ≥ 20%. When this happens the FEV1 will be followed at 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, then hourly for 7 hours. The early asthmatic response is the maximum %FEV1 fall between 0 and 3 hours and the late asthmatic response between 3 and 7 hours post allergen challenge.</description>
