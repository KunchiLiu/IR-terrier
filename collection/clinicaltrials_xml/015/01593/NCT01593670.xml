  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II therapeutic trial combining Decitabine days 1-5 with oral Vorinostat
      twice daily days 6-15 followed by a single infusion of CD3-/CD19- enriched donor natural
      killer (NK) cells on day 17 and a short course of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) to facilitate NK cell
      survival and expansion. Two courses of treatment will be given separated by 6-8 weeks. The
      intent is to administer all treatment in the outpatient setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single donor apheresis will be collected on day 15 of cycle 1, enriched for NK cells with
      the large scale CliniMacs device (Miltenyi) and activated by overnight incubation with IL-2.
      After washing, the final NK cell product will be divided in two, with half given fresh on
      day 17 of course #1 and half stored frozen until day 17 of course #2.

      Clinical response will be formally assessed 4-6 weeks after the start of 2nd course based on
      International Working Group (IWG) criteria; however, bone marrow evaluations will be
      completed to assess for any sign of significant disease progression between cycle 1 and 2.
