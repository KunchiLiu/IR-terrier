      Introduction:

      Elderly with multiple illnesses represent the fastest growing sector of society and make
      increasing demands on all sectors of the health care system, particularly in community
      rehabilitation units due to shorter time of stay in acute care units and hospitals. The aim
      of this study is to investigate the effect of geriatrician-performed comprehensive geriatric
      assessments and intervention with follow up (CGC) in elderly referred to a rehabilitation
      unit.

      Methods:

      The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Settings: two community care
      rehabilitation units in Aarhus Municipality, Denmark. Inclusion: elderly aged 65 and older
      from home or hospital. Exclusion: elderly who received palliative care or had been assessed
      by a geriatrician during the past month. Intervention: medical history, physical
      examination, blood tests, medication adjustment and follow up by a geriatrician. Control:
      standard care with the general practitioners (GPs) as back-up. Hospital contacts (primary
      outcome), GP contacts, activities of daily living (ADL), physical and cognitive functions,
      quality of life, institutionalization, medication status, and mortality were assessed at day
      30 and 90 after arrival at the rehabilitation unit. preliminary

      Preliminary results:

      In total, 370 persons were randomized (184 control/186 intervention group). The mean age was
      77.9±7.9/78.3±8.3 years. No difference in mortality was demonstrated. Analyses on hospital
      contacts, GP contacts, activities of daily living (ADL), physical and cognitive functions,
      quality of life, institutionalization, medication status are ongoing.

    <textblock>
      A new model of care for elderly referred to community rehabilitation was developed and
      implemented. The potential benefits of this model will be compared with usual care in a
      community rehabilitation unit in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial. We hypothesized that
      the geriatrician-performed CGC in elderly referred to a rehabilitation unit will reduce the
      hospital contacts by 25 % without increase in mortality and contacts to GPs and home care
      services. We expect that this model of care will prevent deterioration in ADL, physical and
      cognitive functioning, and reduce the risk of institutionalization. If the results are
      positive, community rehabilitation services should change their routines for treatment of
      this population accordingly.
