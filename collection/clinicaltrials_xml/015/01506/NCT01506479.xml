  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of exercise on patients who
      have been recently diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD). The investigators are going to
      test two levels of exercise (moderate to vigorous) against no exercise. The investigators
      think that exercise may reduce the symptoms the of PD, and the investigators hope to learn
      what level of exercise will offer the most benefit.

      The overall objective of this Phase II study is to determine the futility or non-futility of
      conducting a Phase III randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of exercise on
      the progression of PD symptoms. The primary aim is to determine whether individuals with de
      novo Parkinson's disease (naïve to drug treatment) can achieve the randomly assigned levels
      of mean exercise intensity (60-65% HRmax or 80-85% HRmax) and adhere to the exercise
      protocol.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if intense endurance exercise warrants further investigation as a therapeutic intervention for motor symptoms in the treatment of de novo Parkinson's disease by conducting a futility trial.
The exercise groups will demonstrate potential for therapeutic efficacy using a futility threshold of theta = 3.5 points on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale(UPDRS)motor scale at 6 months when compared with the no exercise control group who are wait-listed to then receive treatment. The incidence of adverse events and 6-month attrition associated with the exercise groups will also be evaluated.</description>
