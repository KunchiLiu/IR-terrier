    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if the use of botulinum toxin prior to a medium
      strength combination chemical peel (Jessner's peel followed by 35% Trichloroacetic acid
      peel) will improve the appearance of crow's feet wrinkles when compared to a chemical peel
      alone. Botulinum toxin type A is a purified substance, derived from a bacteria that block
      muscular nerve signals. Jessner's Peel, a combination of resorcinol (14g), salicylic acid
      (14g), and lactic acid (85%) in ethanol (95%), is a superficial chemical peel. These two
      products/procedures have been FDA approved to improve the appearance of facial wrinkles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wrinkling in the skin is caused by habitual facial expressions, aging, sun damage, smoking,
      poor hydration, and various other factors. There are two major types of wrinklesâ€”dynamic and
      static. Dynamic wrinkles, which are due to excessive muscle activity, usually of the face,
      tend to disappear when you relax your facial muscles. The most common of these dynamic
      wrinkles are frown lines, forehead wrinkles, and eye wrinkles (or crow's feet). However, if
      the excessive muscle activity is carried on for too long, these do not disappear completely
      on relaxation, and are thus called static wrinkles. Static wrinkles are formed either by
      chronic excessive muscle activity or are due to the effects of age and gravity, with a loss
      of subcutaneous fat. Examples of static wrinkles are the nasolabial folds, which are the
      deep grooves running from the sides of the nose to the corners of the mouth.

    <description>The botulinum toxin will be injected into the wrinkles. The injections will take about 10 minutes to complete. Five follow-up visits will be scheduled at 1-7 days, 7-10 days, 2.5-3 weeks, and 12-14 weeks.</description>

    <description>After cleansing the face with a pre-treatment cleansed composed of water and alcohol, the Jessner's peel solution will be applied to the entire face with a large cotton swab. The mixture will be left in place for a few minutes, and then the face will be wiped clean with water. Next, the TCA peel will be applied around the eyes. After leaving in place for a few minutes, cool, iced washcloths will be applied and the face will be wiped clean with water.
Wound care regimen will consist of dilute acetic acid and either Aquaphor or petroleum jelly.</description>
