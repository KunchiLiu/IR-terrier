          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2

          -  Histologically-confirmed metastatic melanoma (unresectable Stage IIIc or IV) with an
             activating BRAF mutation other than V600E

          -  Measurable disease (as defined by RECIST, v1.1)

          -  Adequate recovery from most recent systemic or local treatment for cancer

          -  Adequate organ function

          -  Women of childbearing potential and male partners of women of childbearing potential:

             post-menopausal for at least 1 year are eligible to participate in this study

          -  Agreement not to donate blood or blood products during the study and for at least 6
             months after discontinuation of vemurafenib; for male patients, agreement not to
             donate sperm during the study and for at least 6 months after discontinuation of
             vemurafenib

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Invasive malignancy other than melanoma at the time of enrollment and within 2 years
             prior

          -  Concurrent anti-tumor therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, other targeted therapy, radiation
             therapy, including participation in an experimental drug study)

          -  Either a concurrent condition or history of a prior condition that places the patient
             at unacceptable risk if he/she were treated with the study drug or confounds the
