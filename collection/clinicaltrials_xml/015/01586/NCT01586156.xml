    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious condition characterized by endothelial
      dysfunction leading to pulmonary vascular constriction, smooth muscle and endothelial
      proliferation, and progressive right-sided heart failure. The severity of pulmonary
      hypertension is mostly determined by the response of the right ventricle (RV) to the
      increased afterload or pulmonary pressures, and RV failure is the leading cause of death in
      PAH. Most accepted therapies for PAH have been aimed at vasodilation of the pulmonary
      vasculature, and there has been little thought that PAH patients would benefit from
      traditional left heart failure treatments. A cornerstone therapy in left heart failure is
      £]-adrenergic receptor blockade because of its ability to reverse cardiac remodeling and
      improve clinical outcomes, despite decades of concern regarding its propensity to exacerbate
      heart failure. It has been reported to reduce mortality by about 30% in patients, and while
      the precise mechanisms that contribute to its beneficial effects remain to be elucidated,
      there is evidence that patients with underlying contractile reserve (i.e., via recruitment
      of viable myocardium with £]-adrenergic receptor stimulation) may experience greater
      recovery of their cardiac function. In a study using rats with pulmonary hypertension
      treated with £] blocker, RV function improved, and maladaptive myocardial remodeling was
      prevented.

    <description>Eligible subjects will receive open label carvedilol therapy at a dose 3.125 mg twice daily for one week. Subjects will be admitted overnight to the CRU for the first-dose challenge of carvedilol. Subjects will take the medication for one week and at the end of one week, eligible subjects will be randomized to one of two groups (blinded). Group 1 will receive 3.125mg twice daily for six months.Group 2 will receive carvedilol in a dose escalation scheme. They will be given 3.125mg tablets to take twice daily for one week, followed by 6.25 mg twice daily for one week, followed by 12.5mg twice daily for one week with the option to increase to the max dose of 25mg twice daily for the remainder of the study.</description>
