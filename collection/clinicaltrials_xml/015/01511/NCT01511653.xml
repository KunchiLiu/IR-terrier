    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a multi-center, 6000 subject validation study of several
      biomarkers for early detection of colon cancer. There are 2 stool based biomarkers (one is a
      panel) and 1 serum based biomarker being validated in this study. The biomarkers will be
      compared with colonoscopy and with FIT (fecal immunohistochemistry) tests which are the
      current standards for colon cancer screening. This is an NCI-early Detection Research
      Network funded project. The population targeted for this study are those persons undergoing
      colonoscopy for screening or routine surveillance. Prior to colonoscopy or even prepping for
      colonoscopy, subjects will provide blood and stool samples as well as specific data
      regarding their GI and general medical history and concomitant medications. If subjects are
      interested in participating, arrangements will be made to see them. The informed consent
      process will take place, blood will be obtained, data will be obtained, and the stool kit
      described and given to the subject to take home. Stool samples will be sent back to the
      University of Michigan from all sites using prepaid UPS mailing labels.

      5.0 STUDY DESIGN 5.1 Subject Recruitment The clinical research associate or study nurse
      (hereafter &quot;CRA&quot;) at each clinical site will identify subjects with appointments for
      screening colonoscopy via IRB-approved HIPAA-compliant site-specific methods (Appendix
      B-tailored to each site). Recruitment methods could include letters from the primary care
      physicians and gastroenterologists, direct referrals to the study team by physicians,
      in-clinic recruitment advertisements, and presentations. Interested subjects will be asked
      to participate in a baseline visit prior to initiation of colonoscopy preparative
      procedures, either at the local Center or during a visit to the subject's home by a CRA.
      Advertisements (e.g., newspapers, AARP Magazine, Clinicaltrials.gov) may also be used to
      recruit subjects from the surrounding communities.

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To validate various biomarkers (stool, blood, urine, FIT) as predictive tools for assessing risk of CRC. Ultimately, these markers may increasing screening and compliance with screening recommendations of CRC by triaging those at higher risk of CRC by thesenon-invasive markers. Those at higher risk of CRC based on biomarker results would be referred for colonoscopy. The assumption is that compliance with colonoscopy would increase if biomarkers suggested an increased risk.</description>
