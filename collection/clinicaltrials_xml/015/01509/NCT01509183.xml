    <textblock>
      Asthmapolis is collaborating with Catholic Healthcare West (CHW) to carry out a focused
      demonstration project to evaluate the effectiveness and potential cost savings of a
      deployment of the Asthmapolis approach to asthma management. The Asthmapolis goal is to
      bring together the best technology and asthma insight in order to provide CHW with an
      engaging, data-driven chronic care program to improve asthma management and lower healthcare
      utilization costs, and to respond to prevention-focused reforms to health insurance laws.

      This project has been designed to implement and evaluate a data-driven program to improve
      asthma management and control and lower direct costs through reductions in healthcare
      utilization. This program has been developed by Asthmapolis and has gone through preliminary
      testing. Each subject participating in the study will receive an Asthmapolis device, which
      captures the time and location of use of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators over a
      twelve-month period. This information is processed and delivered at regular intervals to the
      patient and his or her provider to support improved asthma management.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of the adoption of the Asthmapolis system
      into a healthcare organization, and to provide sufficient information to inform decision
      making for potential future adopters. The researchers believe that the Asthmapolis system
      has the potential to improve asthma control by providing rescue inhaler actuation data and
      tailored asthma management tips to patients with uncontrolled asthma, and rescue inhaler
      actuation data to their providers. Improvements in asthma control should be reflected in
      reductions in healthcare utilization for asthma, and potentially for general healthcare
      utilization. Reductions in utilization would result in lower healthcare costs. The study has
      been designed to capture data on individual subject asthma control, and changes in
      utilization and costs over a one-year introduction period.

    <description>The Asthmapolis system works through the provision of information to patients and their providers. With the Asthmapolis device in place, each actuation of a patient's rescue inhaler is recorded with an automatic time stamp; in many circumstances, the location at which the device is actuated is also captured and recorded. Actuation data are then securely transmitted to Asthmapolis where events and an assessment of asthma control can be viewed in secure online interfaces. The information is also compiled into individual reports that are returned to the patient and his or her provider. Patients also receive customized suggestions for asthma management based on their actuation history.</description>
