  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to see if an innovative family-based intervention can
      reduce childhood obesity by actively engaging the whole family in promoting healthy
      behaviors in the home. In additions, the project will also examine how the HOME Plus family
      intervention influences children's dietary intake, frequency of family meals, availability
      of healthy and unhealthy foods in the home and served at meals and snacks, and screen time
      (TV, game systems). The study will provide important information on strategies that families
      can use at home to prevent obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a serious public health problem with limited effective prevention
      strategies to date. Although previous nutrition and physical activity environmental
      approaches for obesity prevention show some promise, most studies have not shown reductions
      in excess weight gain. Moreover, few prevention studies significantly engage parents and
      focus on the home environment. To prevent childhood obesity it is essential to promote
      healthy behaviors in the home environment because parents are influential primary role
      models for healthy eating and sedentary behavior, and are gatekeepers for food and beverage
      availability and degree of inactivity within the home. Moreover, the home setting is where
      most of children's calories and energy dense foods are consumed and where children engage in
      much of their sedentary behavior, particularly screen time (e.g., television, computer, game
      system). The proposed study will test the efficacy of the Healthy Home Offerings via the
      Mealtime Environment (HOME) Plus program, a ten-month, family-based health promotion
      intervention to prevent excess weight gain among 8-12 year old children. The program is
      based on Social Cognitive Theory and a socio-ecological framework and promotes both regular
      and nutritionally-sound snacks and meals in which family members eat together (i.e., family
      meals) and encourages reductions in sedentary behavior, particularly screen time among
      children in the home setting. The efficacy of the intervention will be tested in a
      randomized controlled trial with 160 families randomized to two conditions (intervention or
      attention-only control). Two cohorts of families, recruited from after-school programs and
      community centers, will be followed for 2.5 years. The primary hypothesis is that, by the
      end of the ten month intervention, target children in the intervention families, relative to
      children in the control families, will have significantly lower body mass index (BMI;
      primary outcome) after adjustment for baseline BMI values. Secondary outcomes include
      frequency of weekly family meals and number of healthful foods and beverages available in
      the home and served at family meals and snacks (as reported by parent), target children's
      daily intakes of healthful foods and beverages, and target children's minutes of sedentary
      behavior per week, particularly screen time. Child and parent measurement will occur in
      their homes at baseline, post-intervention (12-months post-randomization), and follow-up
      (9-months post-intervention) by trained research staff. The proposed study builds upon
      successful methods from our HOME pilot study (2006-2008; NIH R21-DK0072997) and is
      innovative as it actively engages entire families in experiential activities and capitalizes
      on the home setting. The study will provide important information on environmental and
      behavioral strategies that families can use at home to prevent excess weight gain. The
      intervention program has high translation potential and is likely to be immediately useful
      to families of school-age children because it will be tested in real-world community
      settings and sustained across the state of Minnesota by the University of Minnesota's
      Extension Service.

    <description>By the end of the intervention, intervention families, relative to control families, will report eating meals together as a family more often. Frequency of family meals will be measured with a survey questions on both the parent and child surveys that asks how many times in the past week they most of the family has eaten dinner together (0-7 times).</description>

    <description>By the end of the intervention, target children in intervention families, relative to target children in control families, will report eating healthier foods and beverages. A trained interviewer will complete three 24-hour dietary recalls at each data collection time point with the child. The three days will be averaged to get an estimate of usual intake. Macronutrients such as calories, sugar, and fat will be examined as well as food groups such as fruits and vegetables.</description>

    <description>By the end of the intervention, target children in intervention families, relative to target children in control families, will report engaging in fewer minutes of sedentary behavior per week. Sedentary behavior will be measured with survey questions asking children how many hours per day they spend doing each sedentary activity (such as watching TV, using the computer, playing video games). Separate questions will be asked for week days and weekend days then the will be weighted to determine the minutes of sedentary activity per week.</description>

    <description>By the end of the intervention, intervention parent, relative to control parents, will report having more healthful foods and beverages in their homes and served at family meals and snacks. The HOME Food Inventory assesses which foods families currently have in their home from a list of items. The Evening Meal Screener provides details about the types of food the family ate for dinner and the cooking methods used. The Snack Screener records information about sacks the child ate in the home. Families complete seven Evening Meal and Snack screeners and the results are averaged.</description>

    <description>The HOME Plus program families will participate in monthly, two-hour group sessions for ten months at local community centers. Each session offers new ideas focusing on family meals, healthy eating, and reducing sedentary behavior. At each session, families prepare and eat a meal together and participate in small group discussions and activities for both parent and child groups to promote healthy behaviors in the home. Topics include planning healthy meals and snacks with your family, having meals with your family more often, and improving the healthfulness of the food available at home. Families also receive periodic supportive phone calls throughout the year using motivational interviewing techniques to promote healthy behaviors to prevent and reduce childhood obesity.</description>
