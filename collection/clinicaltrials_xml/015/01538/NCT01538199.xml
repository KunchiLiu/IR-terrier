  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if using Transcranial LED Therapy (TLT) using the
      PhotoMedex's Omnilux NEw-U LED helps improve symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD).
      TLT works by briefly delivering near-infrared (non-visible) radiations to the forehead. The
      radiations penetrate the brain and stimulate the cells &amp; metabolism.

      Our goals are

        -  To assess the antidepressant effect of the TLT in depressed subjects.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the TLT in depressed subjects

        -  To assess the acceptability of the TLT in depressed subjects

        -  To pilot test the impact on cognition of the TLT in depressed subjects (Ancillary
           Study)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TLT has previously been evaluated in two large studies of people who have had a stroke. To
      date, TLT has been administered to over 550 people who have had a stroke. TLT has also been
      used in 10 people with MDD who were taking part in a research study. During this study, TLT
      was shown to relieve MDD symptoms without causing too many side effects.

      The -Infrared Radiation (NIR) device is also marketed for wrinkles treatment, however it is
      experimental for the use in depression. An experimental device means that it is one that has
      not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      During this study, the investigators hope to better find out if NIR TLT is helpful for
      treating depression. The investigators will do this by comparing the effects of TLT (&quot;active
      treatment&quot;) NIR device to a sham treatment (which is an inactive or &quot;pretend&quot; treatment)
      device. The sham (&quot;pretend&quot;) device looks exactly like the NIR device but will not use a
      near-infrared radiation during the study visits. There are two sets of identical devices
      that will be used in this study, producing active and sham treatment, respectively. The
      devices work exactly the same when you are receiving active treatment and sham treatment,
      except that the devices will produce therapeutic transcranial LED energy during the active
      treatment sessions but it will not produce this LED energy during the sham treatment
      sessions.

      The investigators hope to enroll about 30 subjects in this study at the Massachusetts
      General Hospital Depression Clinical and Research Program.

    <description>The subject will lie down comfortably on a exam bed . The sites of application of TLT (left and right forehead) will be inspected for any skin lesions (e.g. laceration or signs of inflammation) which would contraindicate the treatment. The subject will wear protective eyewear in the form of goggles or eye pads.
The staff administering the TLT will be careful not to shine the light in or near the eyes of the subject. The two OLS devices will be secured in position with the use of a Hair Net. The delivery of the TLT is expected to last 20 min total (simultaneous application on the left and right forehead). The subject will be asked to rest for five minutes after the delivery of TLT. The skin at the sites of the application will be inspected again prior to dismissing the subject.</description>
