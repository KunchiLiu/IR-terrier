      Scleroderma,also known as systemic sclerosis (SSc), is a multisystem disease affecting skin
      and other tissues including joints, muscles, lungs, the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys
      and tissue fibrosis is widespread. SSc presents special problems for developing therapies
      due to the heterogeneous clinical presentation, the variability of disease progression and
      the difficulty quantifying the extent of disease. For most disease manifestations, treatment
      is primarily symptomatic and generally inadequate.

      This study will utilize a 4-gene biomarker of skin disease as the primary efficacy outcome
      in a short duration, placebo-controlled clinical trial of rilonacept, designed to provide
      preliminary data for a larger trial. These gene biomarkers should provide a strong surrogate
      for such trials in the future and, if IL-1 is indeed the cytokine leading to fibrosis in
      this disease, provide a highly significant start to finding a therapeutic for SSc that for
      the first time might dramatically affect fibrosis. A central hypothesis of this study is
      that IL-1 inhibition will downregulate the 4-gene biomarker over a relatively short period
      of time, much shorter than is historically thought necessary to see changes in the MRSS, a
      skin score measurement tool. Entry criteria will include the recent onset of diffuse
      cutaneous SSc as this is the population most likely to show progressive skin disease and
      also the population examined in previous studies showing correlations between MRSS and the
      4-gene biomarker.

      Secondary outcomes will include other validated measures of SSc disease activity. MRSS and
      SSc health assessment questionnaire (SHAQ), will be followed during the trial. This study
      will also test the effect of rilonacept on global skin gene expression using microarray
      analyses of skin biopsies. In addition, serum biomarkers of SSc disease activity (COMP,
      THS-1 and IFI44) and a biomarker of inflammasome activation (CRP) will be tested before and
      after treatment.

      Overview of Systemic Sclerosis

      Scleroderma, also known as systemic sclerosis (SSc), is a multisystem disease affecting skin
      and, more variably, other tissues, commonly including joints, muscles, lungs, the
      gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. It is one of a group of diseases in which fibrosis is
      associated with organ dysfunction. Fibrosis can involve the liver (Lefton et al., 2009;
      Pinzani et al., 2005), lung(Frankel and Schwarz, 2009), kidneys (Schnaper, 2005), and less
      commonly other organs, representing a final common pathway to organ dysfunction. In SSc
      tissue fibrosis is widespread, variably involving skin, lungs and the gastrointestinal
      tract.

      Although SSc can affect almost any part of the body, skin disease is the most consistent
      clinical manifestation. Skin disease typically starts in the hands with an edematous phase
      of hand swelling lasting one to several months. The skin then progressively thickens and
      tethers to underlying tissues. In diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), skin thickening, induration
      and tethering typically extend proximally up the arm and can involve the torso, abdomen,
      face and legs. Patients with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) have skin disease limited to
      below the elbow and face and neck as well as other characteristic clinical features. SSc
      skin pathology (diffuse and limited cutaneous SSc) shows fibrosis and variable perivascular
      lymphocyte infiltration in the deep reticular dermis.

      SSc affects multiple other body systems. Most severe complications are seen more frequently
      in dcSSc with considerable morbidity and mortality(Steen and Medsger, 2000). Lung disease
      manifests as interstitial fibrosis or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, more common in
      lcSSc). Lung disease remains the leading cause of death among SSc patients. Gastrointestinal
      disease primarily results from dysmotility. In the esophagus and stomach this most commonly
      leads to esophagitis. In the small and large bowel this most commonly leads to constipation,
      bowel obstruction and/or malnutrition. Renal disease is primarily manifest as accelerated
      hypertension and renal insufficiency. Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors are
      generally though not uniformly effective for treating this manifestation, which previously
      led to significant mortality.

      Other important clinical manifestations include cold-induced vasospastic disease in
      extremities (Raynaud's phenomenon) and digital ulcers. SSc can also have cardiac
      manifestations. Pericarditis is the most frequent cardiac manifestation. Subclinical
      pericarditis is common with large effusions developing occasionally. Myocardial involvement
      with low-grade myocardial fibrosis is relatively common, but not frequently of clinical
      importance (Follansbee et al., 1985). Fibrosis most commonly manifests as the appearance of
      a septal infarction pattern on EKG in patients with normal coronary arteries, or as
      ventricular conduction delays. Occasionally myocardial fibrosis leads to heart failure.
      Cardiac arrhythmias are seen in ~5% of patients with SSc. Most common are atrial or
      ventricular ectopy, generally not associated with more serious rhythm disturbances. However,
      thallium perfusion defects are associated with sudden cardiac death (Steen et al., 1996).

      Current treatment for SSc is limited (Steen, 2001). For most disease manifestations
      treatment is primarily symptomatic and generally inadequate. The exception is renal disease,
      scleroderma renal crisis, once a major cause of mortality in SSc patients, can often be
      treated successfully with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Pulmonary complications
      now represent the major cause of mortality. Cyclophosphamide provides some benefit in
      patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD), the most lethal complication of SSc. However,
      the effect of this agent on SSc-associated ILD is modest and transient (Tashkin et al.,
      2006; Tashkin et al., 2007). Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) also leads to
      considerable mortality in SSc patients. PAH may respond to vasodilators such as epoprostanol
      and bosentan, but frequently responses are incomplete and mortality still high(Badesch et
      al., 2009) . Bowel hypomotility also leads to considerable morbidity and sometimes
      mortality. Esophageal hypomotility is treated, frequently without success, with pro-motility
      and acid-blocking agents. Dysmotility of the lower bowel and its complications are even more
      difficult to treat with pro-motility agents providing modest relief in some patients and
      antibiotics helping in cases of small bowel overgrowth. Thus there are limited therapeutic
      alternatives for SSc patients faced with progressive lung or bowel disease.

      Skin fibrosis, the hallmark feature of SSc remains without effective treatment. Although
      skin changes in SSc are not a cause of mortality, they cause considerable morbidity, may
      reflect similar pathological processes to those that occur in the bowel and lungs, correlate
      highly with prognosis and disease progression in other organ systems, and can be
      reproducibly assessed by skin score testing. Skin disease is of particular interest for
      evaluation in clinical trials since it is easily biopsied and can thus be repeatedly
      assessed for pathological changes during clinical trials (Lafyatis et al., 2009).

      Part of the difficulty in finding effective treatments for SSc has been a continuing
      uncertainty regarding what initiates pathogenesis. The cause of disease manifestations in
      SSc remains obscure, although three major pathophysiologic explanations have been advanced.
      Prominent pathologic changes in dermal and pulmonary tissues show fibrosis, suggesting
      abnormalities in matrix deposition. Vascular disease, resulting in scleroderma renal crisis,
      digital ischemia and pulmonary hypertension suggests dysfunction of the vascular
      endothelium. Autoantibodies in SSc patient sera suggest that immune dysfunction and
      autoimmunity may contribute to or cause disease. The different pathological features in
      different organs have provided support for each of these mechanisms, but not clarified which
      is most important in overall pathogenesis.

      Background: IL-1 Rationale for blocking IL-1 in Systemic Sclerosis: The inflammasome and
      fibrosis Several observations have implicated IL-1 in fibrotic diseases and SSc.
      Environmental or occupational exposure to silica dust leads to fibrosis (Cohen et al., 2008)
      and has been associated with SSc (Rustin et al., 1990). Recently, several groups have shown
      in murine models that silica dust activates inflammation and fibrosis through the
      inflammasome (Cassel et al., 2008; Hornung et al., 2008) . Activation of the inflammasome
      also contributes to bleomycin-induced lung injury (Gasse et al., 2007).

      Rilonacept blocks IL-1β signaling by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL-1β and
      prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. Rilonacept also binds IL-1α and IL-1
      receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) with reduced affinity.

      Rationale for Rilonacept In This Study SSc presents special problems for developing
      therapies due to the heterogeneous clinical presentation, the variability of disease
      progression and the difficulty quantifying the extent of disease. The variability of disease
      progression presents particular challenges for deciding whom to treat, leading to
      overtreatment of patients as well as misinterpretation of open label trials. This
      heterogeneity of disease progression has also required recruitment of relatively large
      patient numbers into clinical trials, many with skin disease that is going to stabilize or
      improve spontaneously (Amjadi et al., 2009).

      Purpose/Objectives

      This study will utilize a 4-gene biomarker of skin disease as the primary efficacy outcome
      in a short duration, placebo-controlled clinical trial of rilonacept, designed to provide
      preliminary data for a larger trial. The change in 4-gene SSc biomarker skin score from day
      0 to day 42 or last observation carried forward(LOCF) will be measured in both
      rilanocept-treated patients as well as placebo patients and the scores will be compared.
      These gene biomarkers should provide a strong surrogate for such trials in the future and,
      if IL-1 is indeed the cytokine leading to fibrosis in this disease, provide a highly
      significant start to finding a therapeutic for SSc that for the first time might
      dramatically affect fibrosis. A central hypothesis of this study is that IL-1 inhibition
      will downregulate the 4-gene biomarker over a relatively short period of time, much shorter
      than is historically thought necessary to see changes in the MRSS. Entry criteria will
      include the recent onset of dcSSc as this is the population most likely to show progressive
      skin disease and also the population examined in previous studies showing correlations
      between MRSS and the 4-gene biomarker.

      Secondary outcomes will include other validated measures of SSc disease activity. MRSS, SSc
      health assessment questionnaire (SHAQ), which includes the health assessment questionnaire
      (HAQ) and a SSc specific, patient visual analogue scale (VAS) for organ specific involvement
      will be followed during the trial. Several studies suggest that the SHAQ accurately measures
      disease activity and may detect smaller changes in health status. This study will also test
      the effect of rilonacept on global skin gene expression using microarray analyses of skin
      biopsies. In addition, serum biomarkers of SSc disease activity (COMP, THS-1 and IFI44) and
      a biomarker of inflammasome activation (CRP) will be tested before and after treatment. The
      change in MRSS score, SHAQ score, skin myofibroblast score, gene expression, CRP and serum
      biomarkers from day 0 to day 52 will be compared between the rilanocept-treated patients and
      the placebo-treated patients.
