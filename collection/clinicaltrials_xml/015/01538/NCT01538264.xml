  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the use of an advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      technique for measuring blood flow into brain tumors. This technique does not use
      radioactive tracers, and it can provide high quality images that can be obtained in a
      standard MRI scanner.

      Our goals are:

        1. To compare the blood flow measured with this technique with measures of tumor blood
           vessel density in pieces of the tumor surgically removed as a normal part of clinical
           treatment. This will confirm a relationship between the imaging measurements and the
           microscopic characteristics of tumors.

        2. To compare the blood flow in tumors before therapy with the concentration of choline,
           an indicator of cell proliferation. This choline concentration can be measured with
           another MRI technique. This information will demonstrate the relationship between cell
           proliferation and blood supply and will also determine whether the choline measurement
           adds additional information that is clinically necessary.

        3. To determine the reproducibility of blood flow measurements in tumors. This is
           necessary to better understand the sensitivity of the technique to changes in flow
           caused by a treatment or changes in tumor vascularity.

        4. To monitor changes in blood flow after initial treatment. Since sometimes tumors can
           reappear, the repeated measures will help determine how useful this new imaging
           technique is at detecting such recurring tumors.
