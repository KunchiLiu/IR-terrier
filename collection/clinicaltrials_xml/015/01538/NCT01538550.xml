  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Norwegian government has funded a pilot study of a national colorectal cancer screening
      programme. This implies initiation of a screening pilot in the catchment area for two
      hospitals in Norway. The target population is average risk men and women at age 50-74 years.
      The programme is designed as a comparative effectiveness programme evaluating acceptance and
      test performance for two screening methods - fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and flexible
      sigmoidoscopy (FS). This protocol describes the main methodological issues, necessary
      resources and the expected effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several candidate screening modalities - fecal occult blood (FOBT), flexible
      sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, CT and MRI colonography and a range of molecular markers. Of
      these, only FOBT and FS have been subjected to long-term follow-up in randomised trials
      (RCTs). These two modalities will be tested in a head-to-head comparison by 1:1
      randomisation. Previous studies have suggested that the attendance for FS may be lower than
      for FOBT. However, participation has been shown to decline with repetitive rounds required
      for FOBT, while infrequent or once-only screening may suffice for FS. A better test
      performance for FS makes it uncertain which method may be most beneficial in a public health
      perspective. This is the first time a national screening programme is designed as a platform
      for comparative effectiveness studies.

      The pilot study will be carried out in two hospital catchment areas in South-East Norway -
      each with a target population of 70,000 men and women at 50-74 years of age - altogether
      140,000 individuals to be randomised 1:1 between screening with an immunochemical test for
      faecal occult blood (iFOBT) biennially or FS once only. The primary endpoint is colorectal
      mortality reduction after 10 years. Attendance for FS is expected to be 50% and 60% for
      iFOBT. Expected CRC mortality reduction is 30% (286 CRC deaths) in the FS arm and 15% (143
      CRC deaths) in the iFOBT arm (intention-to-treat). In a 1:1 randomisation with 80%
      statistical power and a significance level of 5% it will require 65,000 individuals in each
      arm to disclose a statistically significant difference between FS and iFOBT screening in an
      intention-to-treat model. We expect 5% in the iFOBTs group to test positive and require
      colonoscopy work-up. A positive FS is defined as 'any advanced neoplasia' (CRC, adenoma
      &gt;10mm, adenoma with high-grade dysplasia or villous components). A finding of advanced
      neoplasia is expected in 5% of FS requiring full colonoscopy.

      Study entry-date: First round screening of the iFOBT arm (70,000 invitees) has to be
      finished in years 1 and 2 of the trial while the flexible sigmoidoscopy arm (70,000
      invitees) requires years 1-4 to be completed. Randomization of altogether 140,000 invitees
      was performed in year 1 of the trial - thus rendering the flexible sigmoidoscopy arm prone
      to more relevant time-dependent events between randomization and time of screening actually
      being offered. Therefore, primary entry-date was defined as day of real (for those
      attending) or suggested appointment (for non-attenders) in the screening arm as all letters
      of invitation stated a suggested day for appointment chosen by randomization. Primary entry
      date in the iFOBT arm was similarly defined as date of iFOBT sampling for those attending
      and date of mailing iFOBT-kits plus one week for non-compliant invitees. Randomization date
      was chosen as a secondary study entry date to allow comparative analysis of effects of
      choosing the two entry date definitions.
