    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized dose-escalating Phase 1
      clinical study designed to examine the safety of infusing escalating doses of
      CNDO-109-Activated Allogeneic Natural Killer Cells-(from a first or second degree relative),
      after a preparatory chemotherapy regimen, in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) who are in their first complete remission at the time of enrollment, are not
      candidates for stem cell transplant, and are considered to be at high risk for recurrence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             screening visit

          2. The patient achieved CR1 within 10 weeks of the screening visit; the patient may have
             received post-remission consolidation therapy (except for transplant) prior to the
             screening visit

          3. A bone marrow aspiration performed within 21 days prior to the start of pre-infusion
             preparative therapy confirms the patient is in CR1

          4. The patient has either refused or is not considered an appropriate immediate
             candidate for transplantation and is considered to be at high risk for recurrence by
             having at least one of the following prognostic factors:

               -  High risk cytogenetics (-5, -7, del(5q), abnormal 3q, 11q23 translocations,
