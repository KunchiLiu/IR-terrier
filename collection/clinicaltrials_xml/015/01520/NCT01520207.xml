  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney failure can result from a variety of conditions and can be temporary or permanent.
      Hemodialysis is available as a replacement treatment to perform the work that the kidneys
      normally do. However, the dialysis procedure can be associated with rapid changes in the
      composition of the blood - this may lead to changes in blood pressure and in turn reduced
      blood supply to important parts of the body. We aim to investigate if giving a medicine
      (called mannitol) during dialysis may be able to reduce the frequency of these low blood
      pressure events.
