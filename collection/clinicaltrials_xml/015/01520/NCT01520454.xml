  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese people have elevated levels of the hormone leptin. Despite this, they seem to be
      resistant to the effects of this hormone, which usually regulates appetite and energy
      expenditure. This is similar to what happens with insulin levels in the obese.

      It has been shown that obese people also have higher levels of free fatty acids in the blood
      when compared with lean people, and that this may cause impaired effect of insulin. The
      investigators believe that elevated free fatty acids may also affect leptin function. In
      this study, the investigators are increasing the levels of free fatty acids in healthy
      volunteers and looking for effects on leptin function before and after.

          -  Age 18-65

             sensitivity (anemia, infectious diseases, renal or hepatic failure, uncontrolled
             hypertension, cancer, lymphoma, chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory
             bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, states of cortisol or growth hormone excess,
             alcoholism or drug abuse, and eating disorders).

          2. History of diabetes mellitus.

          3. Subjects taking any medications that are known to influence glucose metabolism such
             as glucocorticoids will also be excluded. We will screen for these conditions by

             excluded. We will screen for these similar to above.

          5. Cholesterol greater or equal to 250 mg/dL and/or triglyceride levels greater than 500
             mg/dL at the time of screening, as determined by laboratory testing.

          6. Subjects who have a known history of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid-like reactions or
             who have a known hypersensitivity to anesthetic agents such as Lidocaine or Marcaine
             will be excluded from the study.

          7. Hypersensitivity to fat emulsion or any component of the formulation; severe egg or
             legume (soybean) allergies; pathologic hyperlipidemia, lipoid nephrosis, acute
             pancreatitis associated with hyperlipemia.

          8. Hypersensitivity to heparin or any component of the formulation

          9. Severe thrombocytopenia, uncontrolled active bleeding, disseminated intravascular
             coagulation (DIC); suspected intracranial hemorrhage.

         10. Subjects with a history of bleeding dyscrasia, poor wound healing or any medical
             condition precluding supine position will be excluded from the study.

         11. Unable to follow study protocol or any condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator makes the subject unsuitable for the study.

         12. Pregnancy

         13. Prior history of gastrectomy, gastric bypass surgery, or other weight loss surgery.
