    <textblock>
      This project aims to investigate the efficacy of two models to treat Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD) for Cambodian refugees in primary care. The first step in both models is
      giving a medication, which is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SSRN), with paroxetine being the first-line agent. For those
      patients who still have PTSD, the second step is either another medication or a culturally
      sensitive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The investigators hypothesize that patients
      will improve in both models, but more so in the the CBT model.

      This project aims to investigate the efficacy of two models to treat PTSD for Cambodian
      refugees in primary care. The first step in both models is giving a medication (an
      SSRI/SSRN, e.g., paroxetine). For those who still have PTSD, the second step is either
      adding another medication (e.g., prazosin) or providing culturally sensitive cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT). We hypothesize that patients will improve in both models, but more
      so in the the CBT model. The primary outcome measure is PTSD severity as assessed by the
      PTSD Checklist (PCL). Eligibility requirements include having PTSD and having been old
      enough to remember the Khmer Rouge period.
