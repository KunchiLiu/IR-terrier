      The investigators are conducting this randomized trial to determine if IBBS (Integrated
      Brain, Body, and Social)intervention is an effective treatment for ADHD (attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder) in two culturally distinct settings; Hamden, Connecticut and
      Beijing, China. A subgroup of the children in Hamden will also participate in a brain
      imaging study before and after IBBS.

      IBBS combines computer-presented brain exercises with a physical education curriculum, all
      of which is designed to be fun, as well as to enhance sustained attention, inhibitory
      control and other executive capacities.

      IBBS is a school-based program in which groups children (composed of children with ADHD,
      children at risk for ADHD, and typically developing children) alternate between a classroom
      setting and the gymnasium four days a week for 15 weeks. These mixed age groups will be
      composed of children with ADHD, children at-risk for ADHD, and typically developing
      children. Although IBBS takes place in a group setting, the computer game component
      individualizes instruction to maximize benefit for each child.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
      characterized by a failure to develop age-appropriate executive functions. Children with
      ADHD struggle to sustain and direct attention, to inhibit response to task-irrelevant
      stimuli and to contain and down regulate impulsive behavior. ADHD can interfere with healthy
      emotional and cognitive development. It often has a negative impact not only on a child's
      academic performance but also on peer and family relationships.

      Medications are now widely used to treat ADHD in the US. However, we are evaluating another
      approach. Based on nearly 30-years of research by scientists at Yale and in China, our
      Integrated Brain, Body, and Social (IBBS) Intervention for ADHD combines computer-presented
      brain exercises with a physical education curriculum, all of which is designed to be fun, as
      well as to enhance sustained attention, inhibitory control and other executive capacities.
      Work by other investigators has also shown that computer exercises designed specifically to
      address aspects of neurocognitive dysfunction in ADHD can lead to improvements in working
      memory and sustained attention; however IBBS is the first intervention to combine advanced
      computer games with sports activities.

      IBBS is a school-based program in which groups of 10 children (Kindergarten, First, and
      Second graders) alternate between a classroom setting (45 mins) and the gymnasium (45 mins)
      four days a week for 15 weeks. These mixed age groups will be composed of children with
      ADHD, children at-risk for ADHD, and typically developing children. Although IBBS takes
      place in a group setting, the computer game component individualizes instruction to maximize
      benefit for each child.

      Since the social context has a clear impact on the expression of ADHD, we have also
      incorporated the &quot;Good Behavior Game&quot; (GBG) into these group activities. The GBG is intended
      to facilitate group participation and to enhance co-operative interactions both in the
      classroom and the gymnasium. The use of the GBG is another innovative feature of IBBS. Thus
      far, our preliminary results have shown that IBBS leads to a fundamental increase in
      cognitive abilities and focused attention.

      We are conducting this randomized trial to determine if IBBS is an effective treatment for
      ADHD in two culturally distinct settings; Hamden, Connecticut and Beijing, China. A subgroup
      of the children in Hamden will also participate in a brain imaging study before and after
      IBBS.
