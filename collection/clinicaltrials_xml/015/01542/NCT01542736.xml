  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the efficacy of the combination of reduced dose craniospinal radiation (reduced
      from standard of care dosing at 36 Gy to 24 Gy) with concurrent carboplatin and vincristine
      administration for metastatic classical histology medulloblastomas and high-risk
      supratentorial PNETs and metastatic PNETs.
