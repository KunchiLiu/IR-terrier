    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well axitinib works in treating patients with melanoma that
      has spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Axitinib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to axitinib in advanced melanoma. This will
      be assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate toxicity of axitinib as a single agent. II. Determine progression-free survival
      and overall survival. III. Explore the utility of 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine-labeled
      positron emission tomography (FLT-PET) as a predictive marker for response and compare to
      standard radiographic imaging.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the prognostic and predictive significance of circulating melanoma tumor cells.

      II. To examine whether functionally relevant polymorphisms in axitinib-related genes
      (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR] 1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3) correlate with
      efficacy and toxicity of axitinib in advanced melanoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive axitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

    <description>Models will be fit using logistic regression methods. Goodness of fit for these models will be assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The predictive accuracy of the models will be described using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (the so-called &quot;c&quot; statistic). Generally, models with c &gt;= 0.8 are considered to have good predictive ability. The association SUV measurements and OS/PFS time to event will be considered using Kaplan Meier and proportional hazards methods as discussed above.</description>
