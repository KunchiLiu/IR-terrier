      This is a non comparative pre-CE marking pilot clinical investigation is required to
      evaluate the safety and performance in intended use of the Verruca treatment - NPD396, Class
      IIa medical device for verrucas in the adult population. The treatment regime will be
      topical application of the Verruca treatment to the verruca, identified as the reference,
      once daily for 4 weeks.

      Patient &amp; investigator derived outcomes will also be collected to assess clinical
      performance and adverse events and adverse device effects will be reported to assess safety
      profile.

      Patient assessments will take place pre-treatment to determine patient demography, baseline
      clinical status, pain and verruca size prior to treatment. Compliance with treatment
      schedule will be collected via patient diary cards. Furthermore, patients will be assessed
      on day 2 after starting treatment and then again at 7, 14, 21 &amp; 28 days after starting
      treatment. Diary cards will completed through-out the investigation.
