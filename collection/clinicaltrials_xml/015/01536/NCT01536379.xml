  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for many patients with kidney failure.
      Sometimes a transplanted kidney is rejected by the patient's immune system. Many types of
      immune system cells, including B cells, are active in rejection. B cells produce antibodies
      against anything the body sees as non-self, like germs or a transplanted kidney. Most
      medicines that help prevent transplant rejection affect cells other than B cells. Belimumab
      is a medication used to treat a disease called lupus. Belimumab slows development of
      antibody-producing B cells. This study will test whether belimumab works on parts of the
      immune system that cause rejection. Twenty to thirty adults getting a kidney transplant will
      be in this study. Like flipping a coin, a computer will randomly assign half to be given
      belimumab and half to be given placebo (a fake medicine). Patients and doctors will not know
      which medicine was assigned until the study is over. A total of 7 doses of study medicine
      will be given through a vein. One dose will be given during transplant surgery, and the
      other 6 will be given 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks after transplant surgery. Usual
      transplant medicines will also be given. After all of the doses have been given, patients
      will be watched and tested at 24, 36, and 52 weeks after the transplant surgery. Blood
      samples will be tested to see what study medicines do to the immune system in transplant
      patients. If patients get a kidney biopsy, the samples will be tested to see if belimumab
      had any effect. Patients will be asked many questions to see if they are having any side
      effects. The study will be done at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and Guys &amp;St Thomas
      Hospital in London, United Kingdom. A pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, is funding
      the study.

             undergoing multidisciplinary evaluation at the institution at which the
             transplantation will be performed

          -  Donor characteristics: Receiving a deceased donor kidney or a living donor kidney
             allograft

          -  Age &amp; Gender: Male or female between 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive, at the time
             of signing the informed consent

          -  Female Subjects: Not pregnant or nursing and at least one of the following conditions
             apply: a. Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a
             documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea. In the absence of confirmatory laboratory assessments [(a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 million
             international units per milliliter (MIU/mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram per
             milliliter (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomole per liter [pmol/L])] in questionable cases, female
             subjects will be required to use one of the contraception methods as described by the
             investigator or designee, until confirmatory results become available; b.
             Questionable post-menopausal status and agrees to use one of the contraception
             methods as described by the investigator or designee, from Day 0 until 16 weeks after
             the last dose of investigational product or until postmenopausal status is confirmed
             with a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MIU/mL
