    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, open-label trial of salsalate 3 g/day as an adjunctive treatment in 15
      schizophrenia subjects to examine salsalate's effect on psychopathology, cognitive
      functioning, and metabolic parameters.

      Potential subjects will be identified by their clinicians at the Freedom Trail Clinic, or
      Massachusetts General Hospital. A total of 15 subjects will be enrolled.

      The specific aims include:

      Primary aims:

        1. Examine the efficacy of salsalate (3g/day) in improving positive and negative symptoms
           as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for
           Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS).

        2. Examine the efficacy of salsalate in improving cognition as measured by the Measurement
           and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) composite score.

      Secondary aims:

        1. Examine salsalate's effects on Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting glucose, insulin and
           lipids.

        2. Examine salsalate's effects on high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), TNF-Î± and
           IL-6.
