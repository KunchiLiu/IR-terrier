      The purpose of this study is to

        -  compare Progression Free Survival (PFS) after treatment with
           177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate plus best supportive care (30 mg Octreotide LAR) to
           treatment with high dose (60 mg) Octreotide LAR in patients with inoperable,
           progressive (as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]
           Criteria), somatostatin receptor positive, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours
           of the small bowel (midgut carcinoid tumours).

        -  compare the Objective Response Rate (ORR) between the two study arms

        -  compare the Overall Survival (OS) between the two study arms

        -  compare the Time to Tumour Progression (TTP) between the two study arms

        -  evaluate the safety and tolerability of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate

        -  evaluate the health related quality of life (QoL) as measured by the European
           Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-G.I.NET21 questionnaire

        -  explore the correlation of toxicity outcomes and administered radiation doses corrected
           for body weight and body surface area

        -  explore the correlation of clinical efficacy outcomes with the levels of the biomarkers
           Chromogranin-A (CgA) in the serum and 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the urine

        -  evaluate dosimetry, pharmacokinetics (PK) and ECG in a subset of 20 patients

        -  explore the correlation of clinical efficacy outcomes with OctreoScan® tumour uptake
           score

        -  explore the correlation of clinical outcomes with serum levels of Alkaline Phosphatase
           (AP)

    <textblock>
      A multicenter, stratified, open, randomized, comparator-controlled, parallel-group phase III
      study. In this study, treatment with 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate plus best supportive care
      (30 mg Octreotide LAR) will be compared to treatment with high dose (60 mg) Octreotide LAR
      in patients with inoperable, somatostatin receptor positive, histologically proven midgut
      carcinoid tumours; these patients should be progressive under Octreotide LAR. In case
      patients in either arm experience clinical symptoms (i.e. diarrhoea and flushing) associated
      with their carcinoid tumours, Octreotide s.c. rescue injections are allowed.

      Objective tumour response in both arms will be assessed every 12±1 weeks from the first
      treatment date according to RECIST Criteria. The baseline CT scan/MRI must not be older than
      4 weeks before the projected randomization date.

      Patients will be evaluated for safety and tolerability in accordance with the Visit
      Schedules for the 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate arm and the Octreotide LAR arm as indicated in
      Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of metastasized or locally advanced, inoperable (curative intent) at
             enrollment time, histologically proven, midgut carcinoid tumour (to be centrally
             confirmed).

          2. Ki67 index ≤ 20% (to be centrally confirmed).

          3. Patients on Octreotide LAR at a fixed dose of 20 mg or 30 mg at 3-4 weeks intervals
             for at least 12 weeks prior to randomization in the study.

          4. Patients ≥18 years of age.

          5. Patients must have progressive disease based on RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1 while
             receiving an uninterrupted fixed dose of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks). Disease
             progression must be centrally confirmed. In order to make the assessment, two CT (or
             MRI) scans are required. The oldest scan must not be older than 3 years from the date
             of randomization. The most recent scan must not be older than 4 weeks from the date
             of randomization. Both scans must be obtained while the patient is receiving the same
             fixed dose of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks) with the following exceptions; 1)
             it is acceptable if the oldest scan is obtained within 12 weeks of the patient
             receiving a fixed dose regimen of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks); AND 2) it is
             acceptable for either scan to be obtained before or during the time a patient
             receiving a fixed dose of Octreotide LAR has switched to an equivalent dose of short
             acting Octreotide for up to 6 weeks in order to obtain an OctreoScan®, provided the
             patient returns to the Octreotide LAR fixed dose after the OctreoScan® has been
             obtained.

          6. Confirmed presence of somatostatin receptors on all target lesions (for
             target/non-target/measurable lesions definition see §Appendix 2, Section 1 and 2,
             RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1) documented by CT/MRI scans, based on positive
             OctreoScan® imaging within 24 weeks prior to randomization in the study (to be
             centrally confirmed). The OctreoScan® should be one that was performed while the
             patient was on a fixed dose of Octreotide LAR. If a patient has had an OctreoScan®
             performed while Octreotide LAR treatment-naïve, the patient must have a repeat
             OctreoScan® performed after 3 months of Octreotide LAR treatments before entering the
             clinical study to prove that the index lesions or new lesions still meet the criteria
             for inclusion. It is acceptable to have patients temporarily switched to Octreotide
             s.c. (up to six weeks) in order to obtain an OctreoScan®, provided they return to the
             same fixed dose of Octreotide LAR prior to the scan.

          7. The tumour uptake observed in each target lesion (for target/non-target/measurable
             lesions definition see §Appendix 2, Sections 1 and 2, RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1)
             using OctreoScan® must be ≥ normal liver uptake observed on planar imaging (to be
             centrally confirmed) (§Appendices 5 and 6).

          8. Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS)&gt;=60.

          9. Presence of at least 1 measurable site of disease.

         10. [Applicable only for France] All patients included in the trial must be affiliated
             with a social security regime or be a beneficiary of the same in order to be included
             in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Either serum creatinine &gt;150 µmol/L (&gt;1.7 mg/dL), or creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min

             clearance (or measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using plasma clearance
             methods, not gamma camera-based) &lt;50 mL/min (the measured creatinine clearance / GFR
             is required only as confirmatory exam).

          2. Hb concentration &lt;5.0 mmol/L (&lt;8.0 g/dL); WBC &lt;2x109/L (2000/mm3); platelets
