  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' overall goal is to compare the effect of CPAP treatment on intermediate
      cardiovascular risk measures in obese versus lean patients with obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA). The overall hypothesis is that, adjusting for OSA severity and obtaining normative
      data from non-OSA subjects with comparable amounts of visceral adiposity, the two OSA groups
      will have comparable improvements in daytime sleepiness, but that the cardiovascular and
      metabolic improvements following CPAP therapy will be decreased in OSA patients with
      increased visceral adipose tissue. The investigators anticipate that, although there will be
      a greater absolute change in markers of sympathetic activity, inflammation and oxidative
      stress in obese compared to lean OSA patients following CPAP treatment, the levels will
      still be abnormally high in the obese patients resulting in the decreased improvements in
      insulin resistance, arterial blood pressure, and vascular health in obese versus lean OSA
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are independent risk factors for insulin
      resistance, systemic hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Both obesity and OSA are
      associated with increased sympathetic activity, inflammatory activity, and oxidative stress,
      the presumed mediators of their shared clinical consequences. Due to the conflicting results
      of previous intervention studies treating OSA patients with CPAP, the investigators still do
      not know if treatment of obese OSA patients has a substantial benefit on these risk factors.
      In Aim 1, to determine the effects of obesity on the response to CPAP treatment in OSA
      patients, the investigators will compare responses in daytime sleepiness, insulin
      resistance, and arterial blood pressure following CPAP treatment in obese and lean OSA
      patients, stratified by the amount of abdominal visceral adipose tissue, a fat depot
      associated with increased sympathetic activity, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and a
      more powerful predictor than BMI of adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. Aim 2
      will determine the effect of CPAP treatment in these two patients groups on sympathetic
      activity, and inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers. The overall hypothesis is that,
      adjusting for OSA severity and obtaining normative data from non-OSA subjects with
      comparable amounts of visceral adiposity (Aim 3), the two OSA groups will have comparable
      improvements in daytime sleepiness, but that the cardiovascular and metabolic improvements
      following CPAP therapy will be decreased in OSA patients with increased visceral adipose
      tissue. The investigators anticipate that, although there will be a greater absolute change
      in markers of sympathetic activity, inflammation and oxidative stress in obese compared to
      lean OSA patients following CPAP treatment, the levels will still be abnormally high in the
      obese patients resulting in the decreased improvements in insulin resistance, arterial blood
      pressure, and vascular health in obese versus lean OSA patients. Relevance: Obese patients
      are at increased risk of developing sleep apnea. Both obesity and sleep apnea are felt to
      increase the risk of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The proposed
      research will begin to determine if treating obese patients with sleep apnea helps to reduce
      these risks. If the beneficial effects of CPAP treatment are reduced in obese compared to
      lean patients with sleep apnea, then treatment of sleep apnea in obese patients needs to be
      combined with effective management of their obesity.
