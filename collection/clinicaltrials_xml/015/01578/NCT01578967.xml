  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma is called ABVD which is a combination of 4
      chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine). The number of
      cycles of ABVD chemotherapy Hodgkin lymphoma patients receive is about 4-6 cycles. In
      addition to the ABVD chemotherapy, patients with Hodgkin lymphoma will routinely receive
      radiation therapy. The use of chemotherapy and radiation may cause long term treatment
      related side effects such as heart problems and other cancers. Researchers are trying to
      find if combining ABVD chemotherapy with new drugs and reducing the number of ABVD
      chemotherapy cycles given is just as effective as the standard Hodgkin treatment.

      Brentuximab vedotin is approved by the United States Food and Drug administration (FDA) for
      the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed). For this research study,
      the use of brentuximab vedotin in newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma is considered
      investigational. Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody that also has a chemotherapy drug
      attached to it. Antibodies are proteins that are part of your immune system. They can stick
      to and attack specific targets on cells. The antibody part of the brentuximab vedotin sticks
      to a target called CD30. CD30 is an important molecule on some cancer cells and some normal
      cells of the immune system.

      The purpose of this research study is to see the effects of treatment with fewer cycles of
      the combination chemotherapy, ABVD, followed by the study drug brentuximab vedotin has on
      study participants and Hodgkins lymphoma.

      This study is designed as a single arm pilot feasibility trial using an induction of 2-6
      cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) chemotherapy followed
      by 6 cycles of brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) consolidation for previously untreated patients
      with stage I and II non-bulky Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL).

      Feasibility will be determined by the percentage of patients who have no clinical evidence
      of HL, and achieve PET negative disease post brentuximab consolidation. We anticipate
      approximately 40 patients will be eligible across participating centers (including UNC, Mayo
      Clinic, and the UNC Cancer Network (UNCCN)) over a 2 year period. A future phase II study
      evaluating progression free survival (PFS) after ABVD followed by brentuximab vedotin will
      be considered feasible if ≥ 13 of 15 patients enrolled in this pilot trial become PET
      negative after brentuximab vedotin consolidation.
