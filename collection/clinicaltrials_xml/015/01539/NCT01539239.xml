  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, study. After
      informed consent is obtained, patients will be evaluated for eligibility based on glaucoma
      severity, eye health, and visual acuity. Following successful screening, use of all topical
      glaucoma medications will be stopped for a period of &quot;washout&quot; to establish a qualifying
      medication-free intraocular pressure (IOP) value. Clinical follow up will be scheduled over
      the course of the 24 month study, and examinations will be repeated to monitor eye health.
      At the 1 and 2 year follow up, those patients on ocular hypotensive medications will be
      instructed to washout, and then have the diurnal (IOP taken in the morning, mid-day, and
      afternoon in the same day) IOP evaluation. Annual follow up will occur up to 5 years. The
      primary effectiveness endpoint is a decrease in diurnal IOP from baseline compared to the 24
      months diurnal IOP following medication washout.
