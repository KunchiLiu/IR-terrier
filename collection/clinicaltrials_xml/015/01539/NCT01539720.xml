  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unintended pregnancy rates in the United States are among the highest of developed nations.
      These high rates can largely be attributed to incorrect or under contraception of women. One
      focus of decreasing unintended pregnancy and abortion rates has centered on expanding access
      to and use of long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods which include intrauterine
      devices (IUDs), and subdermal implants. Emergency contraception, or post-coital
      contraception, offers significant reductions in the chance of pregnancy following an act of
      unprotected or under-protected vaginal intercourse. The most common method of emergency
      contraception used in the United States is the oral levonorgestrel regimen which reduces
      pregnancy risk by up to 89%. More effective, but rarely used, is the Cu T-380 intrauterine
      device. The intrauterine device has the added benefit of providing extended contraceptive
      use beyond the single episode of unprotected intercourse. The Cu-T380 has been associated
      with heavier and more crampy menses however, likely dissuading women from use. Among all IUD
      users, the levonorgestrel IUS has gained popularity over the Cu-T380, perhaps because it
      offers the potential to improve menstrual related symptoms. There is no data however on the
      efficacy of the levonorgestrel IUS as a form of emergency contraception. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of the LNG-IUS as a method of emergency contraception.
      Participants will be randomized to receive either the most common method, oral emergency
      contraception, or the LNG-IUS. Participants will then be evaluated 5-6 weeks following
      method allocation for pregnancy. Lastly, participants will be asked to complete a telephone
      surveys at 6 and 12 months following method allocation assessing their use of a consistent
      contraceptive method, their satisfaction with their contraceptive method, any use of
      emergency contraception since their enrollment in the study, and lastly any unintended
      pregnancies experienced since enrollment in the study. If we could show that the
      levonorgestrel IUS is as effective as the most commonly prescribed method of emergency
      contraception, we would be introducing another opportunity for LARC initiation and
      subsequently impacting unintended pregnancy and abortion rates.

      to and use of long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods which include intrauterine
      devices (IUDs), and subdermal implants. Emergency contraception (EC), or post-coital
      contraception, offers significant reductions in the chance of pregnancy following an act of
      unprotected or under-protected vaginal intercourse. Oral emergency contraception is commonly
      used in the United States is the oral Ulipristal acetate (Ella) regimen which reduces
      pregnancy risk by 89-95%. More effective, but rarely used, is the Cu T-380 intrauterine
      device. The intrauterine device has the added benefit of providing extended contraceptive

      method of emergency contraception. Participants will be randomized to receive either the
      most common method, oral levonorgestrel, or the LNG-IUS. Participants will then be called
      5-6 weeks following method allocation for results of a self-administered urine pregnancy
      test. Lastly, participants will be asked to complete telephone surveys 6 and 12 months
      following method allocation assessing their use of a consistent contraceptive method, their
      satisfaction with their contraceptive method, any use of emergency contraception since their
      enrollment in the study, and lastly any unintended pregnancies experienced since enrollment
      in the study. If we could show that the levonorgestrel IUS (intrauterine system) is as
