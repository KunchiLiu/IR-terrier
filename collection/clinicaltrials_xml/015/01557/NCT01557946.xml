    <textblock>
      Primarily, this study seeks to evaluate whether citalopram treatment is associated with an
      increase in the Glutamine (Gln)/Glutamate (Glu) ratio in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
      from baseline to day 3 of treatment. Additionally, this study would like to examine whether
      citalopram treatment is associated with an increase in the Gln/Glu ratio in the ACC from
      baseline to day 7 of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female age ≥ 18 and ≤ 65

          2. Meets DSM-IV criteria for MDD

          3. Current score of ≥ 18 on the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unwillingness or inability to provide written informed consent.

          2. Current suicidal ideation

          3. Active psychotic symptoms

          4. Lifetime history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or OCD

          5. Failed treatment with an adequate trial of ≥ 2 antidepressants during the current
             major depressive episode (&quot;failure&quot; will be defined as ≤ 50% subjective improvement,
             and an &quot;adequate trial&quot; will be defined as at least 4 weeks of treatment using at
             least the minimum dose of the antidepressant recommended by the manufacturer in
             product labeling)

          6. DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence, with the exception of nicotine
             dependence, within three months prior to screening

          7. Any history of treatment with electroconvulsive therapy

          8. Positive urine toxicology screen for any drug of abuse or excluded medication at
             screening. Opiate pain medication being taken for a medical condition is exempt from
             needing a negative opiate screen.

          9. Clinically significant medical or neurologic disease, as judged by the principal
             investigator, which would increase the risk to the participant or interfere with
             interpretation of results

         10. Female participants with a positive urine pregnancy test at screening

        12. Pregnancy. Females of childbearing potential must be using an effective contraceptive
        method (e.g., abstinence, prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections,
        double-barrier method, male partner sterilization).

        13. Any screening laboratory abnormality deemed clinically significant by the investigator
        14. A QTc interval on screening ECG of ≥ 450 msec. 15. Use of any excluded medications
        (see Section 6.7 below) that cannot be discontinued during the screening phase 16.
        Previous failure to respond to treatment with citalopram that would, in the judgment of
        the investigator, constitute an adequate trial in MDD 17. Treatment with any
        investigational medications within 30 days prior to screening 18. Any contraindications to
        having an MRI scan, including cardiac pacemakers, metal vascular clips or stents,
        artificial heart valves, certain kinds of prostheses, brain stimulator devices, implanted
        drug pumps, ear implants, eye implants or known metal fragments in eyes, exposure to
        shrapnel or metal filings (wounded in military combat, sheetmetal workers, welders, and
        others), transdermal drug delivery systems, and certain tattoos with metallic ink 19.
