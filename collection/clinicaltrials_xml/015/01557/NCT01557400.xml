  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It is
      caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining
      normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads
      to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type
      of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of DBMD in
      approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered,
      investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense
      mutation. This study is an open-label trial for patients with nonsense mutation
      dystrophinopathy who received ataluren in a prior PTC-sponsored study at a clinical trial
      site in Europe, Israel, Australia, or Canada. The primary objective of the study is to
      evaluate the long-term safety of ataluren, as determined by adverse events and laboratory
      abnormalities.

      The study will enroll boys with nonsense mutation DBMD who have a history of exposure to
      ataluren in a prior PTC study in nmDBMD (PTC124-GD-004-DMD, PTC124-GD-004e-DMD,
      PTC124-GD-007-DMD, PTC124-GD-007e, and PTC124-GD-008-DMD) at a trial site in Europe, Israel,
      Australia, or Canada. Patients will receive study drug 3 times per day (at breakfast, lunch,
      and dinner). Study assessments will be performed at clinic visits during screening and every
      12 weeks during the 96-week treatment period. Patients must also return to the clinic for a
      post-treatment visit 6 weeks after the last dose of ataluren.
