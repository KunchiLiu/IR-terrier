    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to collect data on the commercial use of CORUS® (validated
      quantitative in vitro diagnostic test) Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) blood test to evaluate
      the clinical referral patterns of Primary Care Physicians after receipt of their patients'
      CORUS Score, and to better understand patient management patterns for clinicians ordering
      the test.

      Objective of the study is to assess whether the score provided by the CORUS® CAD test has an
      effect on the Primary Care Physician's patient management and referral patterns once
      received:

        1. no further cardiac testing or treatment

        2. medical therapy for angina or non-cardiac chest pain

        3. Referral to a cardiologist for stress testing with or without imaging, CT angiography,
           or invasive cardiac catheterization.

      Since it takes approximately two days for the physician to receive the result of the CORUS
      CAD, initial diagnostic testing will reflect local standard of care
