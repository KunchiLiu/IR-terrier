    <textblock>
      The investigators will obtain human skin specimen (sized approximately 1 cm x 1 cm) for
      dermatological surgical patients in National Taiwan University Hospital, after informed
      consent was obtained. Human skin keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and melanocytes will be
      cultured from the human skin specimen. The three dimensional images of these cultured cells
      will be observed by a ultra-high resolution 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography.
