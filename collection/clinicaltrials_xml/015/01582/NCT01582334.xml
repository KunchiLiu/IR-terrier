      This is an Argentinian, Multicentre, Observational Study to evaluate Adherence and Long Term
      Outcomes of Therapy in paediatric subjects using easypod™ electromechanical device for
      growth hormone treatment and to assess the level of adherence of subject receiving SAIZEN®
      via easypod™.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in a multicenter longitudinal observational study.
      Parents/subjects will provide their Informed Consent/assent to upload their data for
      population-based analyses and, ultimately, clinical outcomes. Adherence data will be
      primarily derived from the easypod™ device combined with physician data entry of outcome
      measures. Data will be collected both retrospectively and prospectively. This will allow the
      establishment of adherence profiles and explore the hypothesis that patient adherence
      support programs improve adherence and subsequent clinical outcomes. Collected data will be
      also analyzed in a multinational pooled analysis of comparable national studies.

      Primary Objective:

      • To assess the level of adherence of subjects receiving SAIZEN® via easypod™

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the impact of adherence on clinical outcomes for subject receiving SAIZEN®
           via easypod™

        -  To identify adherence subject profiling

        -  To assess the impact of adherence on Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) (i.e. above,
           below or within normal ranges)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Administered growth hormone via the easypod™ electromechanical device according to
             Summary of Product Characteristic (SmPC)

          -  Over the age of &gt;2 years

          -  Under &lt;18 years of age, or over 18 without fusion of growth plates

          -  Parent's or guardian's written informed consent, given before entering data into the
             observational study, with the understanding that the subject or parent/guardian may
             withdraw consent at any time without prejudice to future medical care. If the child
             is old enough to read and write, a separate assent form will be given as defined in
             the appropriate jurisdiction of each country

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects taking growth hormone in whom growth plates have fused (i.e. for taking
             growth hormone for it's metabolic effects)

          -  Contra-indications to SAIZEN® as defined in the SmPC

          -  Use of an investigational drug or participation in another interventional clinical
             study
