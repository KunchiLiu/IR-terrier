  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the pilot study is to test the efficacy and safety of riboflavin/Ultraviolet
      A (UVA) cross-linked human donor corneas as carriers for the Boston Keratoprosthesis (Boston
      KPro) in patients with higher risk for corneal melting (keratolysis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The corneal cross-linking technique has been shown to strengthen the cornea and resist
      degradation by the body's own enzymes. The use of highly-resistant donor corneas is meant to
      eliminate the serious post-operative complication of corneal melting (keratolysis) that
      repeatedly occurs in Boston KPro patients with severe ocular burns, autoimmune and
      cicatrizing diseases.
