    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare LY2605541 and insulin glargine using the following
      measures after participants have been treated for 26 weeks:

        -  Change in participants' overall blood sugar control

        -  The number of night time low blood sugar episodes

        -  The number of participants that reach blood sugar targets without low blood sugar
           episodes at night

        -  The total number of low blood sugar episodes reported

             as specified in the local prescribing information for at least 90 days prior to
             screening. At least 1 of the OAMs must be dosed at, or above, half the maximum daily
             dose allowed by local regulations or at the maximally tolerated dose

          -  Have a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) less than or equal to 9.0% at screening
