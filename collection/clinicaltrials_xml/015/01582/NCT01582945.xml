  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine infusion has been shown to have rapid antidepressant properties, however the
      possible use of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression as augmentation has not been
      investigated. The overall aim of this study is to assess the feasibility, safety and
      tolerability, efficacy and duration of the effect of intravenous N-methyl-D-aspartate
      antagonist ketamine as augmentation of antidepressants for chronic suicidal ideation in
      subjects with severe treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

      This is an open-label study (pilot).

      Patients will undergo two weeks of prospective observation, they will then receive ketamine
      IV 0.5mg/kg over 45 minutes as augmentation of their ongoing antidepressant regimen; after
      three infusions this dose will be increased increase to 0.75 mg/kg in non-responders. The
      schedule of administration will be twice a week for 3 weeks. After this phase, the patient
      will be followed with assessments every two weeks for three months.

      Total duration of the study is 5 months.
