      RATIONALE: Panobinostat and everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving
      panobinostat together with everolimus and to see how well they work in treating patients
      with metastatic or unresectable renal cell cancer that does not respond to treatment with
      sunitinib malate or sorafenib tosylate

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability and determine the recommended dosing for the
      combination of LBH589 and Everolimus in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
      (Phase I) II. To assess the preliminary evidence of tumor response in patients treated with
      LBH589 and Everolimus. (Phase I) III. To evaluate the effect of LBH589 and Everolimus on the
      progression-free survival event rate. (Phase II) IV. To determine the clinical response rate
      of LBH589 and Everolimus in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity of the combination of LBH589 and Everolimus in patients with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. (Phase II) II. To evaluate the effect of LBH589 and
      Everolimus on time-to-tumor-progression (TTP), disease-free survival and overall survival.
      (Phase II) III. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of LBH589 and Everolimus in peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) and tumor that are accessible before and after treatment, if
      available. (Phase II) IV. To evaluate the modulation of tumor metabolism and blood in
      patients treated with LBH589 and Everolimus by FDG and 015 water PET/CT scan. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of panobinostat and everolimus, followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive oral panobinostat once daily on days 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, and 12 and oral
      everolimus once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 4 weeks.
