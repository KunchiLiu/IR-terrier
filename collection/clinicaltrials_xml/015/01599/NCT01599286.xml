  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this drug trial is to determine whether treatment of acute
      hyperammonemia with N-carbamyl-L-glutamate (NCG, Carglumic acid, NCG) in propionic acidemia
      (PA), methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), late-onset CPS1 deficiency (CPSD) and late-onset
      Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) accelerates the resolution of hyperammonemia
      efficiently and safely.

      The primary goal is to determine if the study drug (NCG) efficiently reduces ammonia levels
      following a hyperammonemia episode(s).

      Secondly, the investigators want to know if treatment with this study drug (NCG) efficiently
      improves neurologic function, reduces plasma glutamine levels and lessens the duration of
      hospitalization after each hyperammonemic episode.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized clinical drug trial to evaluate the efficacy of NCG in the
      treatment of two organic acidemias (severe PA and MMA), and two urea-cycle disorders
      (late-onset CPSD and OTCD).

      Primarily, the investigators want to determine whether NCG treatment of acute hyperammonemia
      in severe, neonatal-onset PA, MMA,CPSD and OTCD is efficacious, and whether it is safe. The
      investigators will approach this task in two ways:

        1. Assess whether NCG treatment is effective

           The objective of this study is to assess whether NCG is efficacious in treating
           hyperammonemia and improving outcome:

           - The investigators will realize this goal by randomizing each hyperammonemic episode
           from every subject to NCG (NCG)+standard treatment (NCG-STD) versus placebo+standard
           treatment (PLBO-STD) and subsequently gauging response with the primary outcome of
           plasma ammonia levels, in addition to the plasma glutamine, the Functional Status
           Scale, and the length of hospitalization.

        2. Safety

      The primary safety outcome of the study will be the assessed via the rate of Serious Adverse
      Events (SAEs) defined in this study as death or substantial prolongation of hospitalization,
      as patients are hospitalized as part of entry to the study.

      Safety tests consisting of complete blood count (CBC), liver and kidney function tests,
      coagulation profile (PTT/INR) will be performed before treatment, on the third day of
      treatment, and just prior to discontinuation of NCG. An electrocardiogram will be performed
      before treatment and on the third day of treatment or before discharge if earlier.
