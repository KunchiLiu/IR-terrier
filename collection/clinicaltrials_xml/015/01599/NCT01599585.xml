  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based behavioral activation(BA)
      treatment for depression by comparing it to in-person BA treatment in Soldiers and Veterans
      with Major and Minor Depressive Disorder. We will test the hypothesis that 8 sessions of
      in-home BA delivered via a webcam will be as safe and effective in reducing symptoms of
      hopelessness and depression as in-person BA treatment for depression.

    <measure>Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post treatment - Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The BHS is a 20-item scale for measuring negative attitudes about the future. Each item is scored with a true/false response. Total scores range from 0-20 with higher scores indicating a greater degree of hopelessness.</description>

    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Treatment Session Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Safety data will be collected on adverse events, psychiatric hospitalizations, suicides and non-fatal suicide-related behaviors, number of times the treatment collateral was utilized during treatment, treatment adherence, participant drop-out rate, and frequency of requests for patient or therapist technical support. Safety related data will be recorded after each treatment session on the Treatment Session Checklist.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is the most commonly used self-report measure of clinical depression severity. It consists of 21 items that are rated on a 4-point scale which yield a range of scores from 0 - 63. The BDI-II has sound psychometric properties.</description>

    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI is a self-report measure consisting of 21 items designed to discriminate anxiety from depression. It has high internal consistency (.92) and 1-week test-retest reliability (.75) and discriminates anxious from nonanxious diagnostic groups.</description>

    <measure>Inventory of Attitudes Toward Seeking Mental Health Services (IASMHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The IASMHS is a 24 item assessment of help-seeking attitudes. It includes the following three factors based on components of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior17: Psychological Openness, Help-seeking Propensity, and Indifference to Stigma. Alpha coefficients for the subscales range from .79 to .82, and internal consistency for the full inventory is .87. Test-retest reliability for the factors ranges from moderate to high. Convergent validity is demonstrated by effectively differentiating those who would and would not use services.</description>

    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Treatment - Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) is an 8-item self-report measure of general satisfaction with treatment. Participants are asked to rate variables on a 4-point scale including the kind of service, treatment staff, quality of service, amount, length and quantity of service, outcome of service, general satisfaction, and procedures. The CSQ-8 is scored by summing the individual item scores to produce a range of 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Internal consistency and construct validity have been established and the measure is widely used in research.</description>
