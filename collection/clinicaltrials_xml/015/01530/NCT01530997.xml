  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effectiveness of using
      lower-intensity radiation and chemotherapy to treat human papillomavirus (HPV) associated
      low-risk oropharyngeal and/or unknown primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.
      The cure rate for this type of cancer is estimated to be high, &gt; 90%. The standard treatment
      for this cancer is 7 weeks of radiation with 3 high doses of cisplatin. Sometimes surgery is
      performed afterwards. This standard regimen causes a lot of side effects and long term
      complications. This study is evaluating whether a lower dose of radiation and chemotherapy
      may provide a similar cure rate as the longer, more intensive standard regimen. Patients in
      this study will receive 1 less week of radiation and a lower weekly dose of chemotherapy
      followed by a limited surgical evaluation.

      The aim is to evaluate the pathological response rate of HPV positive and/or p16 positive
      low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) after de-intensified
      chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Patients will receive 54 to 60 Gy of Intensity Modulated
      Radiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent weekly intravenous cisplatin (30 mg/m2). Diagnostic
      imaging (CT and/or MRI) will be obtained 4 to 8 weeks after completion of CRT to assess
      response. All patients will have surgical resection of any clinically apparent residual
      primary tumor or biopsy of the primary site if there is no evidence of residual tumor and
      will undergo a limited neck dissection to encompass at least those nodal level(s) that were
      positive pre-treatment, 4 to 14 weeks after CRT. The primary endpoint of this study is the
      rate of pathological complete response (pCR) after CRT. Longitudinal assessments of quality
      of life and patient reported outcomes will be obtained prior to, during, and after CRT.

    <description>All patients will receive IMRT. Dose painting IMRT will be used and all doses will be specified to the planning target volume (PTV). The high risk planning target volume (PTV-HR) and standard risk planning target volume (PTV-SR) will be treated to the following respective total doses: 60 Gy and 54 Gy. The dose per fraction to the PTV-HR and PTV-SR will be 2 Gy per day and 1.8 Gy per day, respectively. The PTV-HR will include the gross tumor and the PTV-SR will include the lymph nodes at risk for harboring micro-metastatic disease (i.e. subclinical disease).</description>
