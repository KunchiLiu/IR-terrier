    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve survival of patients with recurrent or metastatic
      Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC). This study will test the efficacy of the investigational
      drug, TKI258, in treating ACC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon malignancy that arises in secretory glands.
      The most common sites for the disease are the major and minor salivary glands but these
      tumors may also arise in the nasal cavity, lacrimal gland, tracheobronchial tree, breast or
      vulva. The mainstay of treatment for localized ACC is surgical resection often followed by
      post-operative radiotherapy. Although this leads to an initially high rate of local control,
      the 5-year disease-free survival rate is 50-75%. In addition, a significant proportion of
      the patients develop distant metastases, most frequently in the lung. Compared to other
      malignancies, ACC tends to grow more slowly. Thus, patients often do well in the short-term
      but long-term prognosis remains guarded and most succumb to the disease within 10-15 years.
      To date, systemic therapies have proven to be largely ineffective against recurrent and
      metastatic ACC. Dovitinib is a broad-targeted-profiled RTK inhibitor active against these
      three RTKs (VEGF, FGF and PDGF) involved in tumor cell growth. Based on its potency as an
      inhibitor of these RTKs both in vitro and in vivo, and the compound's oral availability,
      several clinical trials of dovitinib are underway. This phase II trial will test the
      hypothesis that dovitinib will be active against this disease. The rationale is based on
      pre-clinical studies that suggest that dovitinib suppresses tumor growth by blocking
      constitutive signaling of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) and animal studies
      in which the drug proved to be active against primary ACC xenografts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible for inclusion in this study have to meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Patients must have histology or cytology studies that confirm the diagnosis of
             adenoid cystic carcinoma. (Note: Subsequent central review of the pathology slides
             will be provided by Drs. Christopher Moskaluk or Henry Frierson, Department of
             Pathology at the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center).

          2. Patients must have recurrent and/or metastatic disease that is not amenable to
             potentially curative surgical resection or radiotherapy.

          3. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as
             &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan (or &gt;20 mm with conventional techniques). Pathologic lymph
             nodes are measured by shortest diameter as per RECIST.

          4. Patients must have serial imaging that allows measurement of tumor growth rates by
             change point analysis:

        1. The remote baseline study scan must be within six calendar months of the immediate
        pre-study scan.

        2. The remote baseline scan must have measurable disease ≥ 10 mm for non-pulmonary lesions
        or ≥ 4 mm for pulmonary metastases that show subsequent progression.

        3. Comparison of the remote baseline and subsequent studies must show progressive disease
        in 1-5 selected target lesions based on the following:

          1. Modified RECIST criteria (i.e. proportional increase of 1.2 or the appearance of new
             lesions) AND/OR

          2. Progression by change point analysis with an increase in the slope of the average
             tumor measurements of at least 0.22 b

        a = &quot;remote baseline scan&quot; refers to scan done prior to pre-study scan which is used to
        determine pre-treatment tumor growth rate.

        b = the estimated mean minus one standard deviation based on analysis of progressive
        tumors from untreated patients with ACC.

        5. Life expectancy &gt; 16 weeks.

        6. ECOG (WHO) performance status 0-2

        7. Age ≥ 18 years old

        8. Patients must have the following laboratory values:

             creatinine clearance (CrCl) is ≥ 30 mL/min using the Cockroft-Gault equation, see
             formula below:

        CrCl = [140-age (years)] x weight (kg) / [72 x serum Cr (mg/dL)] (if patient is female
        multiply the above by 0.85)

        9. Patients who give a written informed consent obtained according to local guidelines
