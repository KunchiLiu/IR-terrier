      This is a first-time-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation
      (3+3) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, PK, and immunogenicity
      of MEDI0639 in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or
      for which no standard therapy exist. Up to 63 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 3
      to 5 study centers in North America.
