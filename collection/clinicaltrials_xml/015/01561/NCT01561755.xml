      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not intravenous immunoglobulin (lVlg),
      brand name Privigen, is effective in treating a disorder called HIV-associated myelopathy
      (HIVM). This drug is currently not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      treating this disorder.

      HIVM is a spinal cord disease that occurs at any stage of HIV infection. It is not known
      what causes this condition, but symptoms can include weakness in the lower body and problems
      with frequent urination or problems with bowel function, trouble walking or performing
      sexually.

          -  Adequate baseline organ function including the following laboratory values within 14
             days prior to study entry:

          -  Adequate liver function with ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 times upper limit
             of normal (ULN).

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dL Creatinine &lt; 2.3 Serum vitamin B12 level ≥ 200 pg/ml

          -  Diagnosis of HIVM by a neurologist - defined as:

          -  - Presence of at least two of the following symptoms:

          -  - Paresthesias and/or numbness in the lower extremities or in all four limbs;
             Weakness of the limbs, with predominance in the lower extremities; Unsteady, stiff or
             uncoordinated gait; Sensation of electrical shock through the back or the legs upon
             flexion of the neck (L'Hermitte's sign); Stiffness or spasm in the lower extremities;
             Urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence or retention; Fecal incontinence or
             retention; Sexual dysfunction with erectile impairment in men;

          -  - Presence of at least two of the following neurologic signs:

          -  - Reduction in vibratory or position sensation in the lower extremities; Hyperactive
             deep tendon reflexes; Abnormal response to plantar stimulation (Babinski sign);
             Presence of L'Hermitte sign (electrical-type sensation down the back, provoked by
             flexion of the neck); Weakness in the lower extremities or in all four limbs; Spastic
             or ataxic gait

          -  Antiretroviral regimen stable 2 months prior to the entry of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of acute, active, opportunistic infection, except oral thrush, orogenital or
             rectal herpes and MAI bacteremia within 2 weeks before randomization.

          -  Any neurologic or systemic conditions, which in the opinion of the investigator would
             interfere with the evaluation of the subject.

          -  Presence of significant cardiac, pulmonary or renal disease that would place the
             subject at risk for the fluid and protein load of IVIg.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to immunoglobulin, or IgA deficiency; Vaccination with
             live viruses within the past 90 days; Patients receiving IVIg or other
             immunomodulatory agent (cyclosphosphamide, azathioprine, corticosteroids, tacrolimus,
             cyclosporine, OKT3, plasma exchange, alpha, beta or gamma interferon) within the past
             3 months.
