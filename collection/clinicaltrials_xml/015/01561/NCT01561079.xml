      This research will track the longitudinal neurobehavioral development of the
      buprenorphine-exposed fetus across gestation through 1 month of age in an effort to
      determine the safety of this medication for use during gestation, the relationship between
      maternal physiologic changes due to buprenorphine administration and newborn functioning,
      and to determine potential fetal neurobehavioral markers that may predict Neonatal
      Abstinence Syndrome expression and infant neurobehavioral outcome. Comparisons to results
      from a similar project in methadone-exposed pregnancies will be made. This proposal seeks to
      advance the way the investigators inform the treatment of the opioid dependent woman during
      pregnancy and her infant after birth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increase in the prevalence of illicit opiate use among women of childbearing age
      in many countries today. Methadone is the treatment of choice for opioid dependency during
      pregnancy in the US because it markedly diminishes withdrawal symptoms and craving and
      blocks opioid effects, however, in utero exposure results in significant depression of fetal
      neurobehaviors such as fetal heart rate and heart rate variability and fetal motor activity,
      and significant neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the majority of exposed infants. Since
      its approval in 2002, the prescription of buprenorphine for opioid dependence has increased
      dramatically but, as with methadone, this mediation is not approved for use during
      pregnancy. Currently, women treated with buprenorphine prior to pregnancy are transitioned
      to methadone treatment due to a lack of information regarding the effects of buprenorphine
      on the developing fetus and infant. Pilot work by this research team suggests that
      buprenorphine- as compared to methadone-exposed fetuses display more optimal neurobehavioral
      functioning in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Although these results are
      encouraging, there is a critical need to explore fully the effects of this medication on the
      fetus and infant to adequately advise care providers and patients regarding its use. This is
      particularly true given the imminent publication of a pivotal study comparing buprenorphine
      to methadone treatment during pregnancy which has suggested the optimality of buprenorphine
      for the treatment of opioid dependence during pregnancy, and is likely to result in
      increasing numbers of women being treated with off-label buprenorphine during pregnancy.
      This proposal seeks to explore the effect of buprenorphine on maternal physiology and fetal
      neurobehavioral functioning longitudinally as a measure of the development of the fetal
      nervous system. Additionally, the neurobehavioral profile and NAS of the
      buprenorphine-exposed infant up to one month will be delineated in an effort to provide
      information necessary to provide optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment of
      NAS. Furthermore, this group has previously explored similar parameters in methadone-exposed
      fetuses and infants, and results of this study can be compared to those historical data.
      These parameters will advance our understanding of the way the investigators view and
      implement the future pharmacologic treatment of the opiate dependent woman during pregnancy
      and her infant after birth, and inform clinicians, health insurance companies and regulatory
      agencies in the provision of optimal care to the opioid dependent pregnant woman and her
      offspring before and after birth.
