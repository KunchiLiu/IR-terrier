    <textblock>
      CyNCh is a multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of children ages 8 to 17 years
      with biopsy-confirmed moderate to severe nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The
      primary objective is to evaluate whether 52 weeks of treatment with cysteamine bitartrate
      delayed-release capsules will result in improvement in liver disease severity.

          -  A histological severity of: NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) ≥ 4.

          -  Sexually active female participants of childbearing potential (i.e., not surgically
             sterile [defined as tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy]) must
             agree to utilize the same two acceptable forms of contraception from screening
             through completion of the study and to complete a serum pregnancy test at each study
             visit. The acceptable forms of contraception for this study include hormonal
             contraceptives (oral, implant, transdermal patch, or injection) at a stable dose for

             with spermicide). Sexual activity will be ascertained at each study visit for
             post-menarchal females and if sexually active, subject must verify use of the same 2
             acceptable forms of contraception. For pre-pubescent children, a documented
             attestation of abstinence from their parent or guardian will be acceptable.
