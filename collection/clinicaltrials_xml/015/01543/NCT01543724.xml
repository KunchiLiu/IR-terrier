    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess Li-induced gray matter volume changes with regard to the
      endophenotype of GSK3beta polymorphism. The changes of gray matter are supposed to be more
      attributable to neurotrophic and neuroprotective characteristics of Li, which were closely
      related to the inhibition of apoptotic activity of GSK3beta.
