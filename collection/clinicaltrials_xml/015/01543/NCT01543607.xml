  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with malignant bile duct stenosis have poor prognosis and most of the patients are
      not good candidate for surgery at the time of diagnosis. Placement of the stent is the
      palliative care for these patients. However over 50% of the stents get blocked within 6-8
      months. Use of the radiofrequency ablation before the stent placement may improve stent
      patency. Heat will be applied to the bile duct in order to open the blockage and prevent the
      re-growth of tissue into the stent. The investigators are looking to see how safe and
      feasible RFA catheter is in patient with malignant bile duct stenosis.

    <textblock>
      As part of medical care subjects will be undergoing an endoscopic procedure (ERCP) in order
      to evaluate and stent a bile duct blockage. During the ECRP and just prior to the stent
      placement subjects will undergo the placement of a radiofrequency ablation catheter into the
      bile duct blockage. Heat will be applied to the bile duct in order to open the blockage and
      prevent the re-growth of tissue into the stent; after the radiofrequency ablation, stent
      will be placed. Three days after the procedure subjects will receive a phone call from the
      research coordinator to check any adverse or unwanted effects of the treatment. The study
      procedure (radiofrequency ablation) takes place over 10 minutes during ERCP. The subjects
      will undergo routine follow up for their medical problems. No follow up visits are required
      as part of the study.
