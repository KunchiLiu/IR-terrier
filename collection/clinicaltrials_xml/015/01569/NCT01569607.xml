  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity in the U.S. but identification of treatment
      strategies to improve outcome is limited by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms
      of recovery. M1 reorganization plays a major-role in the recovery of motor deficits
      post-stroke; hence the importance for further development of rehabilitative strategies that
      utilize this potential for recovery. Non-invasive cortical stimulation can enhance the
      beneficial effects of motor training on performance and functional plasticity of motor
      cortex. Among the different approaches used in these studies, Hebbian-type M1 stimulation is
      particularly intriguing, as it seems to be more effective when compared to random M1
      stimulation. There is emerging evidence that motor training or cortical stimulation related
      improvement of function are associated with increases in the grey matter of targeted brain
      areas. While there is therefore some evidence supporting structural reorganization in human
      M1 in response to motor learning and cortical stimulation, the mechanisms underlying these
      changes and their relationship to functional plasticity are not known. A better
      understanding of the sequences of events is critical to development of optimal therapeutic
      interventions to improve recovery following stroke. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine if
      repeated exposure to training combined with Hebbian-type M1 stimulation enhances functional
      M1 reorganization in lesioned M1 of stroke patients. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine if
      repeated exposure to training combined with Hebbian-type M1 stimulation enhances structural
      cortical reorganization in lesioned M1 of stroke patients and to explore whether these
      structural changes are related to the training induced functional cortical reorganization.
      At the completion of this project, it is our expectation that we will have determined the
      effect of Hebbian- type stimulation on both, functional and structural brain reorganization,
      thereby obtaining indirect evidence for the neuronal substrate underlying training related
      improvement and maintenance of motor function in stroke patients. This knowledge would be
      expected to have a substantial positive impact on treatment for stroke patients that will
      significantly improve recovery and would move the field of neurorehabilitation forward.
