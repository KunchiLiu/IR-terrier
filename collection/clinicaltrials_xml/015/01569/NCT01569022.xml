  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances are cardinal features of Veterans with post traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). In particular, obstructive sleep apnea is reported to occur more frequently in
      patients with PTSD compared to those without PTSD and contribute to worsening cognitive and
      behavioral functions. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered the treatment
      of choice for OSA but adherence to CPAP in Veterans with PTSD is poor compared to the
      general population. The proposed study aims at comparing the efficacy, tolerability, and
      adherence of oral appliances-an alternative therapy to OSA- to CPAP. The study is
      instrumental in identifying the optimal OSA therapy for Veterans with PTSD and the OSA
      phenotype that would predict oral appliance response

      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder associated with poor neurocognitive
      performance and organ system dysfunction due to intermittent hypoxia and repeated arousals.
      The repetitive hemodynamic stresses are implicated in the increased incidence of systemic
      hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Insufficient and disrupted sleep has similar
      negative impact on mood, attention, cognition, and behavior. In Veterans with post traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD), the disturbed sleep can worsen further the cognitive-behavioral
      manifestations of PTSD and contributes to poor mental and physical health outcomes. Recent
      epidemiologic studies largely support the association of higher rates of OSA in patients
      with PTSD compared with the general population. Treatment of the underlying obstructive
      sleep disturbances with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has resulted in
      restoration of sleep architecture, decrease daytime sleepiness, and reduction in nightmares
      frequency and intensity. However, adherence to treatment with CPAP is less than optimal in
      Veterans with PTSD. Mandibular advancing devices (MADs) are considered non surgical
      alternatives to CPAP and are preferred in a head to head comparison to CPAP in OSA subjects
      without PTSD. However, there has been no study to the investigators' knowledge that has
      assessed MAD in terms of clinical efficacy, compliance, and quality of sleep compared to
      CPAP in OSA patients with PTSD. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that MAD is not
      inferior to CPAP in treating OSA effectively in Veterans with PTSD and OSA. To that end, the
      investigators propose to conduct a feasibility study using a randomized crossover trial of
      12 weeks of CPAP and MAD in 42 consecutive outpatients with PTSD newly diagnosed with OSA
      separated by 2 weeks washout period.

      The primary endpoint of the trial is to compare the treatment efficacy of CPAP and MAD in
      Veterans with PTSD and OSA. Secondary endpoints aim at: 1) comparing change in the Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale, SF-36, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at end of treatment
      following use of CPAP versus MAD, 2) comparing adherence and short-term side effects between
      using CPAP and MAD in PTSD patients with OSA, and 3) determining anthropomorphic,
      polysomnographic, and cephalometric predictors of successful MDA response. Assessments at
      the end of both limbs comprise evaluation of quality of sleep, daytime sleepiness, quality
      of life, and side effects of treatment. Compliance with each therapy will be measured at the
      end of each treatment period.

      The results of the trial are pivotal in determining the efficacy, tolerability, and
      adherence to MAD compared to CPAP in Veterans with PTSD and OSA. This feasibility study
      would form the basis of a future trial examining the effectiveness of various therapeutic
      modalities for OSA on PTSD symptomatology and progression.
