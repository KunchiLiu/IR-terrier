  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of optimizing the IMRT
      treatment plan based on dosimeter measurements of mucosal radiation dose adjacent to the
      dental fillings to reduce such dose to &lt; 35 Gy without compromising tumor coverage and/or
      increasing the dose to the remaining oral cavity or nearby parotid glands.

    <description>The primary end point will check if it is feasible to optimize the IMRT plan based on dosimeter measurements of mucosal radiation dose adjacent to the dental fillings to reduce such dose to &lt; 35 Gy without compromising dose to the tumor and the remainder oral cavity and if so, the feasibility of this approach in what proportion of patients and with what characteristics?</description>
