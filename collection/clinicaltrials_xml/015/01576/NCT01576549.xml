    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how LY2127399 works in participants with rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) who are not adequately responding to methotrexate. Participants will receive LY2127399
      via an injection(s) under the skin at 4 week intervals for up to 52 weeks. Key study
      procedures include biopsies of the lining of an inflamed joint and blood tests to measure RA
      activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of adult onset RA disease according to revised 1987 American Rheumatism
             Association (ARA) criteria who are currently or have a documented history of positive
             for rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody
             (anti-CCP Ab) and who have moderately to severely active RA despite ongoing
             methotrexate (MTX) therapy

          -  Have active RA defined as the presence of at least 8/68 tender and at least 8/66
             swollen joints, as determined by the tender joint count and swollen joint count
             assessment forms

          -  Have a screening C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement greater than 1.2 times upper
             limit of normal or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) greater than 28 mm/hr

          -  Have a clinically inflamed joint suitable for synovial biopsy procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have used an unstable dose of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 6
             weeks prior to baseline

          -  Have used oral corticosteroids at average daily doses of &gt;10 mg/day of prednisone or
             its equivalent within 6 weeks prior to baseline

          -  Have received any parenteral corticosteroid injection within 6 weeks of baseline

          -  Have used other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than MTX,
