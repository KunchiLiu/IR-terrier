  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the growing importance of anti-angiogenic therapies in the treatment of metastatic
      renal carcinoma, it is expected that this trial will establish the preliminary data needed
      to apply for funding of a larger clinical investigation of the potential role of PET
      perfusion imaging in management of renal carcinoma, and potentially other cancers.
