          -  Pain &gt; 1 year

          -  Degenerative disc disease as seen on MRI, which must meet minimum disc grading
             criteria: at least a grade III disc degeneration, a hyperintense zone, or abnormal
             disc morphology.

          -  Patients who may have had back surgery will be included.

          -  No epidural steroids or other nerve blocks for back pain either two weeks before or
             during the study period.

          -  No opioids or on short-acting opioids only (max. daily amount=120 mg morphine
             equivalents). It is not feasible to recruit only opioid naive patients.

          -  Must agree to 2-week washout for those on opioids.

          -  No active substance abuse.

          -  No intention to take new pain or psychiatric treatments during the study, including
             chiropractic, physical therapy, or complementary or alternative treatments (CAM). It
             is not feasible to take subjects off of any other pain medications, such as NSAIDS.

          -  No pregnancy or the intent to become pregnant during the study, and no nursing
             mothers.

          -  Women, who are able to bear children, must agree to use contraceptives throughout the
             study.

          -  In men, normal baseline testosterone levels.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with pain due to disorders not including a component of disc degeneration,
             or those with unknown causes of pain will be excluded.

          -  Patients with the intent to undergo back surgery will be excluded.

          -  Patients with a history of recent or ongoing alcohol or other drug addiction
             disorders will be excluded.

          -  Patients with any history of substance abuse of opioids will be excluded.

          -  Patients whose diagnosis cannot be firmly established according to criteria described
             above would not be included.

          -  Patients whose medical and psychiatric comorbidities are not well controlled, or who
             are currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of the medical comorbidity, will be
             excluded.

          -  Males with abnormal testosterone levels will be excluded (normal range is 1800-6650
             pg/ml).

          -  Female patients who nursing will be excluded.
