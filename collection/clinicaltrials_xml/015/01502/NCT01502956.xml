  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, open-label, active-control trial is to compare the
      effectiveness of intra-detrusor botulinum toxin A (Botox A®, Allergan) versus sacral
      neuromodulation (InterStim®, Medtronic) for the treatment of refractory urge urinary
      incontinence. In addition, the study will evaluate select technical attributes of the
      interventions as well as the effect of these two interventions on other lower urinary tract
      and pelvic floor symptoms.

      Hypothesis: InterStim® therapy will result in a greater reduction in daily urge urinary
      incontinence episodes over the 6-month follow-up period as compared to Botox A® injection.

      A supplemental study investigates whether biological markers including those related to
      inflammation and connective tissue remodeling change following treatments with Botox A® and
      Interstim®.

      Primary Aim:

      To compare the change from baseline in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes
      (UUIE) over 6 the six month follow-up period in women randomized to sacral neuromodulation
      (InterStim®) therapy, versus those randomized to intra-detrusor injection with 200 units of
      botulinum toxin A (Botox A®).

      Secondary Aims:

        -  Long Term Efficacy: To compare the long-term (12 and 24 month) efficacy outcomes in
           women randomized to sacral neuromodulation(InterStim®) therapy, versus those randomized
           to intra-detrusor injection with 200 units of botulinum toxin A (Botox A®). Secondary
           efficacy outcomes, collected at 12 and 24 months as well as 6 months,include adequate
           control of their urge urinary incontinence, change in bothersome symptoms of urinary
           urge incontinence (UUI), severity of urge incontinence, urinary frequency, nocturia,
           subject satisfaction with therapy, quality of life measures and bowel and sexual
           function.

        -  Cost Effectiveness: To compare utilization of medical resources for cost effectiveness
           analysis and cost-utility between treatment groups.

        -  Treatment Safety and Burden: To assess safety profile and treatment burden of both
           interventions by comparing adverse event incidence between treatment arms, and also by
           obtaining estimates of incidence of treatment-specific safety and burden outcomes.
           Safety and burden outcomes for Botox A® injections include receipt of additional
           injections and intermittent catheterization due to voiding dysfunction/partial urinary
           retention. Safety and burden outcomes for InterStim® device include infection, pain,
           lead migration, reprogramming (and reasons for) and surgical revision (and reasons
           for).

    <description>The FSLP InterStim® device is to be done within 3 months of enrolling/consenting. The 1st stage is lead placement into the S3 foramen with best response to stimulation. The 4 electrodes will be tested and set to an amplitude that achieves comfortable stimulation in the vaginal, perineal, or rectal sensation. If =/&gt;50% improvement, participant will then have the 2nd stage IPG implantation, 8-18 days after last FSLP. If there is a technical problem with lead on 1st FSLP, then the participant can have a 2nd FSLP and may go on to have IPG implantation with lead replacement. The 2nd FSLP must be initiated no longer than 1 month since the initiation of the 1st FSLP. If the participant is a non-responder and there is no technical problem, then the lead is removed.</description>

    <description>Eligible subjects will complete baseline assessments, be randomized and scheduled for first stage lead placement (FSLP) InterStim®. The criterion for an initial clinical response to InterStim® therapy will be defined as a ≥50% improvement in the mean number of UUIE/day on a minimum 3 day bladder diary, completed during the 7-14 days following the first stage lead placement (FSLP). Subjects with a ≥ 50% improvement mean number of UUIE/day will be eligible to proceed with implantation of the implantable pulse generator (IPG). Subjects will then be followed monthly to determine the response to therapy.</description>

Subjects who received a Botox A® injection will be assessed for a clinical response, at 1 month from injection, using the same clinical criterion (≥50% improvement in the mean number of UUIE/day on a 3 day bladder diary completed prior to the 1 month visit). Those subjects that experience a clinical response, at one month, will be eligible for a repeat Botox A® injection after 6 months, if they experience degradation of clinical effect, using the PGSC.</description>
