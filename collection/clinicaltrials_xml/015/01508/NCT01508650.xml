      Rehabilitation and Exercise Training after Hospitalization: Assessing Benefit in Acute Heart
      Failure (REHAB-HF) pilot is a multi-site, randomized clinical pilot study designed to
      establish the feasibility of conducting a larger clinical trial to address the hypothesis
      that, in addition to standard care, a novel, progressive, multi-domain 3-month
      rehabilitation intervention administered to elderly patients with acute decompensated heart
      failure (ADHF) will improve key clinical outcomes, including the rate of rehospitalization
      and death, physical function, and quality of life.

      Three centers,Wake Forest Baptist Health along with Thomas Jefferson University
      Hospital-Co-Investigator Dr. David Whellan, and Duke Medical Center- Co-Investigator Dr.
      Christopher O'Connor, will recruit a total of 60 consenting patients ≥ 60 years old
      hospitalized with ADHF. Once identified and screened, the participants will be randomized in
      a 1:1 fashion to receive a 3 month novel rehabilitation and exercise training intervention
      or usual care. This multi-domain intervention will include endurance, mobility, strength,
      and balance training and be tailored based on participant performance in each of these
      domains. It will begin during the hospitalization and continue three times per week in an
      outpatient facility.
