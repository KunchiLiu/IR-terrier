      The purpose of this study is to evaluate diagnostic imaging techniques using 124I-NM404
      PET/CT in human brain tumors. This goal will be accomplished by quantifying tumor uptake and
      determining the optimal PET/CT protocol, comparing PET tumor uptake to MRI, and calculating
      tumor dosimetry. The long-term goals of this research are to improve the diagnosis and
      treatment of malignant brain tumors by using radioiodinated NM404
