  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard therapy for patients with early stage breast cancer consists of surgery to remove
      the cancer followed by radiation therapy. One question regarding radiation therapy for early
      stage breast cancer is whether the entire breast needs to be radiated or only a more limited
      area surrounding the tumor. Whole-breast irradiation (WBI) is radiation therapy given to the
      whole breast. Partial-breast irradiation (PBI) is radiation therapy given only to the area
      of the breast where the cancer was removed (called the &quot;tumor bed&quot;).

      The investigators hope the option of PBI will reduce side effects from radiation therapy and
      shorten the radiation treatment process when compared to WBI, since only part of the breast
      is being treated. The investigators also hope that this will make such treatment more
      convenient for breast cancer patients.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the the safety of external-beam PBI in selected
      early breast cancer patients utilizing PBI in ten daily fractions over two weeks. The
      investigators will also evaluate the local control and the cosmetic results.

      After signing the consent form, the following will be assessed.

      -CT scan of the breast that had the cancer removed to help plan the radiation therapy. This
      is referred to as a CT-simulation. This scan is done routinely as part of the regular
      treatment.

      PBI Study Treatment: You will be given PBI once daily over 10 treatment days (Mon-Fri) over
      a 2 week period. During this time you will have a weekly interview, physical examination,
      and your skin will be assessed for any side effects of the radiation.

      PBI will begin between 4 weeks to 3 months after breast surgery or 2-6 weeks after
      chemotherapy (if you have been given chemotherapy).

      After the final dose of the study:

      You will have the following scheduled follow-up visits: one at the completion of the
      radiation, once or twice during weeks 3-9 after the completion of radiation, once every 6
      months for five years, and then once every year for the following five years after the
      completion of radiation therapy.

    <description>To evaluate the safety of external-beam PBI in selected stages 0 and I female breast cancer patients utilizing 40 Gy in ten daily fractions over two weeks. The study will be deemed too toxic if &gt;10% of enrolled patients have at least one of the following outcomes within 24 months of completion of PBI.
Grade 3 or 4 skin/subcutaneous or pulmonary toxicity.
The development of clinical fat necrosis.
The development of rib fracture on the ipsilateral treated side, detected either clinically and/or radiographically.</description>
