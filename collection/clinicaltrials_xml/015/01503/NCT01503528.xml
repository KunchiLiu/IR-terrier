  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if three different methods for providing postoperative
      analgesia following total knee joint arthroplasty affect outcomes. These outcomes include
      pain and function for a period of up to 3 months, and specific non-pain outcomes, including
      cardiac, respiratory, central nervous system, thromboembolism, infection, nausea and
      vomiting and urinary retention.

      Economic outcomes will also be examined, including length of hospital stay, direct health
      care costs and patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to compare the three analgesic regimes for total knee joint arthroplasty
      currently practiced at our institution with regard to their impact on patient outcomes in
      the immediate postoperative period and for up to 6 months. The outcome measures that we will
      be prospectively looking at are:

      A. Pain and functional outcomes: Twice a day pain scores following activity during the in
      hospital stay, number of days that patient requires oral narcotics, presence of complex
      regional pain syndrome, presence and extent of wound hyperalgesia at 3 months, WOMAC scores
      preoperatively and at 6weeks and 3 months. 'Timed up and go' test will be performed on day 3
      or at discharge and at 2 weeks and 3 months. Incidence of falls while in hospital and
      following discharge.

      B. Specific non pain outcomes Cardiac: Myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia,
      Congestive failure, new onset arrhythmia, death Respiratory: Hypoxia requiring supplemental
      oxygen beyond 24 hours, pneumonia, pneumonia requiring prolonged hospital stay CNS:
      postoperative delirium, cerebrovascular accident DVT: symptomatic DVT, asymptomatic DVT,
      Pulmonary emboli Infection: wound infection, prosthetic infection, need for major plastic
      reconstructive surgery or amputation.

      Incidence of nausea and vomiting. Incidence of urinary catheterization. C. Economic
      outcomes: Length of hospital stay, direct health care costs, patient satisfaction

      Primary hypothesis (null):

      Perioperative analgesia provided by femoral and sciatic catheters, or by peri-articular
      wound catheters does not reduce the rate of combined serious outcomes compared with
      analgesia provided by peri-articular infiltration alone..

      Secondary hypotheses (null):

        1. Perioperative analgesia provided by femoral and sciatic catheters or by peri-articular
           wound catheters does not improve functional recovery compared with analgesia provided
           by peri-articular infiltration alone.

        2. Perioperative analgesia provided by femoral and sciatic catheters, or by peri-articular
           wound catheters does not reduce the cost of delivery of care compared with analgesia
           provided by peri-articular infiltration alone.

        3. Perioperative analgesia provided by femoral and sciatic catheters or by peri-articular
           wound catheters is not improved compared with analgesia provided by peri-articular
           infiltration alone.

    <description>Continuous femoral (20mL of 0.2% ropivacaine as the initial bolus) and sciatic (10 mL of 0.1% ropivacaine as initial bolus) nerve blocks will be initiated in the preoperatively and continued for 48 hours. This group will receive spinal anesthetic with 15 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine. This group will not receive peri-articular infiltration. The femoral block will be patient controlled regional analgesia with 0.13%-0.2% ropivacaine, basal rate 5mL/h and patient controlled bolus of 5 mL every hour as needed. The sciatic infusion will be 4mL/hour as continuous infusion. Nurse administered boluses of 10mL of the corresponding solution will be allowed for breakthrough pain. The blocks will be held at 6AM on Postoperative day 2. In the event of inadequate analgesia, and following block discontinuation the patients will receive oxycodone and oxycontin.</description>
