  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea affects approximately 2-4% of middle-aged adults in the general
      population and is associated with several medical conditions including hypertension and
      coronary artery. Research over the last decade has shown that obstructive sleep apnea may
      also increase the propensity for insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the first line therapy for the
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. While PAP therapy has several favorable effects such
      as improvements in daytime sleepiness and quality of life, it is not clear whether using PAP
      therapy can alter metabolic risk. The overall objective of this study is to examine whether
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure therapy improves glucose
      tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The primary hypothesis of this study is that PAP therapy
      of obstructive sleep apnea will improve in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent medical conditions, affecting a
      staggering 246 million people worldwide. Obstructive sleep apnea is a relatively common and
      often undiagnosed condition in the general population. Cross-sectional studies of clinic and
      population-based samples suggest that up to 40% of patients with obstructive sleep apnea
      have type 2 diabetes and up to 75% of patients with type 2 diabetes have obstructive sleep
      apnea. There is increasing evidence that the pathophysiological features of intermittent
      hypoxia and sleep fragmentation may be responsible for altering glucose homeostasis and
      worsening insulin sensitivity. The mechanisms through which obstructive sleep apnea impairs
      glucose metabolism are largely unknown. While intermittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation
      are likely to play an essential role, the relative contribution of each in the causal
      pathway remains to be determined. Moreover, whether the adverse effects of intermittent
      hypoxia and sleep fragmentation are mediated through an increase in sympathetic nervous
      system activity, alterations in corticotropic function, and/or systemic inflammation is not
      known. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether positive pressure therapy for
      obstructive sleep apnea has salutary effects on glucose metabolism. Many of the available
      studies examining the effects of PAP on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are
      plagued by small sample sizes, lack of a control group, and limited data on compliance with
      positive pressure therapy. The current study will assess, using a community-based sample,
      whether treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with positive pressure therapy will improve
      insulin sensitivity, as assessed by the frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test
      (primary outcome measure).

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 2 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin sensitivity will be determined with the insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) before and 2-months after study intervention. This test requires administration of a weight-adjusted dose of D50W as an IV bolus at time &quot;zero&quot;. After the glucose bolus, blood samples are drawn at the scheduled times for 3-hours. At the 20-minute mark, a weight-adjusted dose of regular insulin is administered. The resulting serum is analyzed for glucose and insulin and the &quot;minimal model&quot; (MINMOD) will be used to derive insulin sensitivity.</description>
