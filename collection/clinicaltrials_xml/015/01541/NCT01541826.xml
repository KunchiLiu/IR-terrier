      The purpose of this project is to determine whether chokeberry polyphenols mitigate
      cardiovascular disease risk in former smokers.

    <textblock>
      More than 31% of Connecticut adults are former smokers, which may contribute to the high CVD
      risk in this state. Atherosclerosis, a hallmark of CVD, is a progressive life-long process.
      Chronic cigarette smoking increases atherosclerosis and CVD risk. While smoking cessation
      may lower CVD risk, former smokers still are at high CVD risk. The mechanisms by which
      smoking accelerates atherosclerosis formation are not fully understood. This knowledge gap
      prevents development of informed interventions to reduce CVD risk in former smokers.

      Previous work suggests smoking increases oxidative stress and leads to elevated CVD risk.
      Former smokers also have decreased antioxidants and markers of vascular function in the
      circulation, suggesting that despite cessation, smoking has a lingering adverse effect on
      CVD protective mechanisms. Chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) is a native Connecticut plant
      rich in polyphenol antioxidants and is a promising intervention for reducing CVD risk in
      former smokers. Chokeberries have diverse polyphenols such as anthocyanins,
      proanthocyanidins, resveratrol, quercetin, and chlorogenic acid. Chokeberry consumption
      improves dyslipidemia, inhibits inflammation, and reduces oxidative stress in humans and
      animals, all of which could contribute to the prevention of CVD in former smokers.
      Therefore, our central hypothesis is that dietary chokeberry polyphenols reduce CVD risk in
      former smokers by improving lipid profiles and inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress.
      Our long-term goal is to define the mechanisms by which polyphenol antioxidants mitigate CVD
      risk. The overall goal of this project is to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled
      clinical trial to evaluate the cardio-protective effects of dietary chokeberry polyphenols
      in former smokers.

      Our objectives are to determine 1) the effect of chokeberry polyphenols on plasma
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels and on gene expression involved in cholesterol
      metabolism; 2) the extent to which chokeberry improves antioxidant and vascular function in
      former smokers; and 3) the association of bioavailability of chokeberry polyphenols to
      changes in biomarkers of CVD risk.

      Successful completion of this work will result in improved understanding of the role of
      dietary berry polyphenols to regulate lipid metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress.
      Thus, this study will be an important step to developing dietary recommendations for
      individuals predisposed to CVD risk, particularly former smokers.
