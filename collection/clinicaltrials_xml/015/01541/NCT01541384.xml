    <textblock>
      Novel wireless technology has created inexpensive tools that allow both accurate monitoring
      of adherence to pills as well as real-time interventions such as automated reminders in the
      event of a missed dose. In this study, the investigators will use Vitality GlowCaps, an
      electronic pill bottle. These pill bottles provide an unbiased assessment of pill bottle
      opening and a valid approach to verifying self-administered pill taking, reflecting not only
      daily use but also patterns of drug use and timing. At the prescribed times, bottle will
      electronically transmit whether a subject opened the pill cap to take the immunosuppressant
      medication via a built-in transmitter to the central server. The investigators will
      randomize participants to usual care, customized reminders, and customized reminders paired
      with provider notification in the event of low adherence.

      The investigators' aim: To improve immunosuppression (IS) medication adherence in kidney
      transplant recipients.

      The investigators' hypotheses: a) Automated reminders will improve adherence to
      immunosuppression compared to usual care, and b) Automated reminders, paired with provider
      notification about patients with poor adherence, will improve adherence to immunosuppression
      compared to usual care.

    <description>Subject will receive electronic pill bottle that will track adherence. They will also be able to activate available dosage reminders (text message, phone message, email). The study coordinator will also check adherence every 2 weeks and alert the transplant team when it drops below 90%. The transplant team will determine the next best course of action.</description>

    <intervention_name>Vitality GlowCaps</intervention_name>
    <description>The main research instrument is an electronic pill bottle called GlowCaps that has the ability to transmit reminder messages via email, text, and phone to the subject, and adherence data to special servers. The messages will be sent twice a day, if a subject misses a dose of their immunosuppression medication (tacrolimus). Each time the pill bottle is opened (or not opened), a date- and time-stamped wireless signal is sent to the Vitality server via the AT&amp;T cellular network. No extra cellular or wireless service is required from subjects for the GlowCap to function.
Note: GlowCaps are a &quot;Class 1&quot; Medical Device registered with the FDA. Because of this Class 1 designation, they are not subject to FDA testing or approval.</description>
