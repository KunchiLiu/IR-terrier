  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a primary
      care, family-centered child obesity prevention program beginning in pregnancy and continuing
      throughout the first three years of life compared to routine standard of care. The study
      aims to reduce the prevalence of obesity at age three, improve child diet composition and
      healthy lifestyle behaviors. Pregnant women will be enrolled from a large urban medical
      center serving primarily low-income immigrant Latino families. The intervention &quot;Starting
      Early&quot; will consist of three components. 1) Family Groups: interactive groups coordinated
      with the child's primary care visits and led by a Nutritionist/ Child Developmental
      Specialist. 2) Nutritional Video: a culturally-specific bilingual early nutrition video will
      be incorporated into family group discussions. 3) Plain Language Handouts: given to
      reinforce the curriculum from the family groups.

      Hypothesis: Compared to controls, the intervention group will show reduced obesity and
      improved parent feeding knowledge and increased healthy feeding attitudes, styles and
      practices

      Expected outcomes include: (1) Reduction in the prevalence and degree of obesity. (2)
      Improvement in child diet composition. (3) Improvement in parent feeding knowledge,
      attitudes, styles and practices including. (4) Improvement in lifestyle behaviors, such as
      sleep, screen time and physical activity, associated with increased risk of obesity. (5)
      Improvement in parent diet. Our secondary objective is to understand the mechanisms by which
      changes in parent knowledge and behavioral factors mediate impacts of the intervention on
      childhood obesity. We will also study relationships between potential moderators and
      intervention impacts.
