  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a certain contrast agent (iodixanol)
      to two other commonly used contrast agents called Iopamidol (Isovue) and iohexol
      (Omnipaque), on heart and kidney safety in patients undergoing a cardiac CT angiogram. The
      investigators will evaluate whether iodixanol 320 (Visipaque®), an iso-osmolar agent, is
      better tolerated (flushing, injection site pain/warmth, headache, nausea) and provides equal
      image quality compared with iohexol 350 (Omnipaque®) and Isovue 370 during 64-slice
      multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA). A fourth group (Visipaque 270) will
      be included, using low radiation dose technology during acquisition, to evaluate image
      quality, tolerability, and contrast enhancement compared to both Visipaque 320 and Omnipaque
      and Isovue. In addition to image quality, tolerability, and contrast enhancement, the
      investigators will evaluate heart rate, adverse events, reimaging, costs, and patient
      satisfaction among all four cohorts.

      The study will recruit 400 participants already undergoing CT angiography and consent and
      randomize them to one of four groups. Each of the possible contrast agents used are commonly
      used for CT angiography, so the primary risk is loss of confidentiality and being asked
      questions about tolerability. All other facets of the study (3 lead ECG, beta blockade,
      nitroglycerine use, CT angiography and contrast administration) are standard of care and
      being done for clinical uses.
