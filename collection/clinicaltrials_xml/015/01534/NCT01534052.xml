      A study to assess the safety of continued administration of MDV3100 in subjects with
      Prostate Cancer who have already undergone treatment with MDV3100 and showed benefit.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center extension study in subjects with prostate cancer who have completed
      MDV3100 treatment study to assess the long-term safety of continued administration of
      MDV3100, when judged by the investigator to be in the best interest of the subject.

      For the study duration, all subjects with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) will
      have to maintain androgen deprivation with a Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH)
      agonist/antagonist unless they underwent bilateral orchiectomy.

      Subjects will be discontinued from study drug when continued administration of study drug is
      deemed to be not in the subject's best interest by the investigator based on clinical
      assessment.

      Throughout the study, safety and tolerability will be assessed by the recording of adverse
      events, monitoring of vital signs and physical examinations, safety laboratory evaluations,
      and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs).

      Subjects will have a safety follow-up visit 30 days after their last dose of study drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has completed a prior study with MDV3100, can be enrolled in this extension study
             without any interruption in study drug

          -  No new clinically significant abnormalities based upon physical examination, safety
             laboratory data, vital signs, ECG, and other clinical assessments noted from the last
             visit conducted during the subject's active MDV3100 study prior to initiation of this
             study

          -  Male subjects and their female spouses/partners who are of childbearing potential
             must be using highly effective contraception1 consisting of two forms of birth
             control (one of which must be a barrier method) starting at Screening and continue
             throughout the study period and for 3 months after final study drug administration.
             Male subjects must not donate sperm starting at Screening and throughout the study
             period and for at least 3 months after final study drug administration. 1Highly
             effective contraception is defined as:

               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal form/gel/film/ cream/suppository

          -  Subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while on treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subject will be excluded from participation if any of the following apply:

          1. Subject has a history of seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure
             including, but not limited to underlying brain injury, stroke, primary brain tumours,
             brain metastases, or alcoholism.

          2. Subject has a history of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within 12
             months prior to Day 1 of the completed preceding study.

          3. Use of the following prohibited medication/therapies:

               -  Concomitant medication that likely could cause clinically relevant drug-to-drug
                  interactions with MDV3100.

               -  Other (than MDV3100) androgen-receptor (AR) antagonists (bicalutamide,
                  flutamide, nilutamide).

               -  Investigational therapy other than MDV3100 or investigational procedures of any
