  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us learn what is the best amount of fluid to administer
      to patients during liver surgery. Patients will receive either an amount for this surgery
      based on weight, blood pressure, heart rate and urine output or an amount guided by a
      computerized system (FloTrac) that helps doctors know how much fluid each patient needs. The
      FloTrac calculates the amount of fluid patients needs on a minute-to-minute basis, based on
      real time information like blood pressure, pulse and the ability of the heart and blood
      vessels to maintain normal vital signs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (18 years old or greater) who are able to provide informed consent.

          -  Patients who undergo an open, elective liver resection. Including those initially

             additional procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active coronary disease.

          -  Patients with a history of coronary disease will be eligible if they have had a
             cardiac stress study showing no reversible ischemia and normal LV function within 3
             months of operation.

          -  Active symptomatic cerebrovascular disease.

          -  Active congestive heart failure and ejection fraction &lt;35%.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant (female patients of child-bearing potential must
             have a negative serum pregnancy test â‰¤ 14 days prior to surgery or 15 to 30 days
             prior to surgery with a negative urine pregnancy test the morning of surgery).

          -  Presence of ascites.
