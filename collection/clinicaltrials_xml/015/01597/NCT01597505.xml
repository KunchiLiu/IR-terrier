    <textblock>
      608 patients with Clostridium Difficile Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) will participate in this
      study and receive either oral vancomycin or CB-183,315 in a blinded fashion. Treatment will
      last for 10 days and participants will be followed up for at least 40 days and a maximum of
      100 days. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well CB-183,315 treats CDAD as
      compared to vancomycin.
