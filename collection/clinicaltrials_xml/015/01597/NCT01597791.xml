  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that many parturients can, in fact, spontaneously micturate
      with low dose combined spinal epidural analgesic doses given for labor and that Foley
      catheterization is unnecessary in the majority of these parturients. At Prentice Women's
      Hospital, almost 9000 women annually receive neuraxial labor analgesia and 98% of those
      receive Foley catheters. By potentially reducing the necessity for Foley catheters, the
      investigators should be able to ultimately reduce the rate of bacteriuria, urinary tract
      infections and urethritis leading to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics, as well as
      reduce costs of placing unnecessary Foley catheter.The hypothesis is parturients receiving
      low dose combined spinal epidural analgesia for analgesia after induction of labor who are
      randomized to a spontaneous micturition protocol will require fewer Foley catheter
      placements and demonstrate a lower incidence of positive urine culture postpartum than those
      who undergo standard Foley catheter placement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Nulliparous

          -  Term (≥37 week gestation)

          -  Healthy

          -  ASA class 1-2

          -  Who are being induced for labor who request labor analgesia and who successfully
             receive standard combined spinal epidural analgesia (verbal rating score for pain ≤ 1
             after 10 min)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with ASA 3 or greater

          -  BMI ≥40 kg/m2

          -  Prior history of urge or stress incontinence or urinary retention before pregnancy

          -  Women with a history of nephrolithiasis

          -  Chronic urinary tract infections

          -  Women whose post-void residual volume as assessed by ultrasonography is found to be
             &gt;100ml before epidural placement will be excluded.

          -  Women with an absolute or relative contraindication to the usual combined spinal
             epidural technique

          -  Failed analgesia will be excluded

          -  Women for whom the anesthesiologist selects an analgesic technique other than
             combined spinal epidural technique or fail to obtain CSF for CSE will be excluded

          -  Women with fetal heart rate decelerations before request for analgesia will be
             excluded due to increased risk of cesarean delivery.

          -  Women who experience inadequate labor analgesia due to nonfunctioning epidural
             catheter necessitating epidural replacement will be included but noted as a protocol
             violation.
