      Background: Very few drugs exist that treat hyperammonemia, specifically PA and MMA. Diet
      restrictions and alternate pathway agents are the current primary treatments, but they
      frequently fail to prohibit brain damage.

      Orthotopic liver transplantation cures the hyperammonemia of urea cycle disorders, but organ
      availability is limited and the procedure is highly invasive and requires life-long
      immunosuppression.

      A drug that could repair or stimulate a dysfunctional urea cycle such as this would have
      several advantages over current therapy. A drug called N-carbamyl-L-glutamate, Carglumic
      acid (NCG or Carbaglu)has recently been found to be virtually curative of another urea cycle
      defect called NAGS deficiency. In this disorder, treatment with NCG alone normalizes
      ureagenesis, blood ammonia and glutamine levels, allows normal protein tolerance and
      restores health. Knowledge from this study is being applied to acquired hyperammonemia,
      specifically in patients with propionic PA and MMA, to try and improve neurodevelopmental
      outcomes by improving the hyperammonemia.

      Aims: The overall objective of this project is to determine whether treatment of acute
      hyperammonemia with Carglumic acid in propionic acidemia (PA), methylmalonic acidemia (MMA)
      changes the long-term outcome of disease and to determine if it is effective in restoring
      urine ammonia levels to normal levels.

      Methods/Design This 5-year, Phase II, double-blind study aims to recruit and enroll 34 PA
      and MMA patients during acute episodes of hyperammonemia.

      The primary aim is to circumvent the long-term neurodevelopmental decline due to having a
      prolonged levels of ammonia during crisis in the blood and urine. After treatment and crisis
      resolution with Carbaglu or placebo and standard of care therapy, measures of
      neurodevelopmental outcomes (Bayley II and Functional Status Scale) are being measured at 9,
      15,21 and 30 months post-discharge from the hospital. Safety of NCG treatment will also be
      monitored as measured by close examination of adverse events and laboratory blood tests. To
      test for the effectiveness of NCG, longitudinal models to evaluate the groupwise difference
      (NCG vs. Placebo) in the trajectory of change in neurodevelopmental outcomes and safety
      analyses between drug and placebo patients.

      Subsequent Episodes At any time after the initial episode, participants may present to the
      hospital with PA- or MMA-associated symptoms. If the plasma ammonia level verified as a
      bonafide episode of HA (plasma ammonia is ≥ 100 µmol/l), that participant will receive the
      same study medication that they received during their initial episode in a double-blinded
      fashion, (i.e. If the participant received NCG at the time of initial randomization, he/she
      will continue to receive NCG at each subsequent HA episode. If the participant received PLBO
      at the time of initial randomization, he/she will continue to receive PLBO at each
      subsequent HA episode). Only the pharmacist will know if the participant receives NCG or
      PLBO. The same study assessments (previously stated) will be conducted at each qualifying
      HSA episode.

    <description>Active NCG &amp; Standard of Care Chemical Composition: N-carbamyl-L-glutamic acid (NCG) The daily dose will be 100 mg/kg/ day. The doses are to be divided into 2 equal doses and administered orally or enterally by nasogastric or gastrostomy tube (standard of care will prevail when choosing the mode of drug administration).
The tablets must be dispersed in a minimum of 2.5-10 ml of water and ingested immediately or administered by fast push through a syringe via a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube. The suspension has a slightly acidic taste.
This drug will be administered for 7 days after admission or until discharge (whichever is sooner).</description>
