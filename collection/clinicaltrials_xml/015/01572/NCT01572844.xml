  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory muscle disorder that is often associated with many skin
      findings. One of the skin findings seen in up to 50% of individuals with juvenile
      dermatomyositis, an early onset form of this condition, and up to 20-30% of adult
      dermatomyositis patients who have not responded to treatment, is calcinosis, or deposits of
      calcium within the skin and muscle tissue. In addition to being cosmetically unappealing,
      involvement of deeper tissues with calcinosis may lead to contractures, or shortening of
      muscles, which may have a significant impact on functioning and quality of life.
      Unfortunately, there is no known effective treatment of dermatomyositis associated
      calcinosis. However, recent reports have shown that a medication called sodium thiosulfate
      has been effective in treating individuals with calciphylaxis, a condition where calcium is
      deposited within blood vessels, and with tumoral calcinosis, a genetic form of
      calcification, when receiving this medication by vein. In addition, recent advances in laser
      technology have led to the development of methods that may allow topical medications to
      penetrate deeper layers of the skin. The investigators have designed a pilot study to
      evaluate the use of topical sodium thiosulfate solution in treating superficial calcinosis
      in individuals with juvenile and adult dermatomyositis. The investigators will use laser to
      assist in the delivery of this medication to areas of calcinosis.

      Five individuals who meet the eligibility criteria will take part in this study. They will
      have a variety of assessments performed throughout the treatment period in order to evaluate
      both dermatomyositis and calcinosis severity and their potential response to fractional
      carbon dioxide and sodium thiosulfate treatment. A medical history will be taken and
      baseline assessments will be performed during the screening period. Serum creatinine kinase
      levels will be determined on this visit and repeated at the end of the study (week 20);
      these levels will be one measure of monitoring disease activity during the study. One
      calcinosis lesion will be treated, assessed, and followed. If a second calcinosis lesion is
      present, it will act as a control (not treated). Two weeks prior to the first treatment
      session, an optional (not required) skin biopsy of the target (treated) calcinosis lesion
      will be offered to the the first 3 patients â‰¥ 18 years of age to determine optimal
      fractional carbon dioxide laser settings that will be used for treatment. Area and durometer
      (a device that measures hardness) measurements and photographs of the calcinosis lesions
      will be performed at weeks 0,4,8,12,16,and 20. One x-ray of the control and one x-ray of the
      target calcinosis lesion will also be performed during the screening period and at week 20.
      Assessment of muscle strength, physical functioning, endurance, and range of motion, as well
      as myositis activity outside of the muscles will be performed during the screening period
      and at weeks 8 and 20. Myositis damage assessment will be performed at the screening period
      and at week 20. Questionnaires to assess physical functioning pertaining to activities of
      daily living and quality of life, as well as the quality of life related to skin disease and
      the calcinosis lesions will be completed during the screening period and at weeks 8 and 20.
      Treatment of the target calcinosis lesion with fractional carbon dioxide laser and topical
      sodium thiosulfate will occur on weeks 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,and 18. Each patient will
      receive a total of 8-10 treatments over a 6 month period. Assessments for any side effects
      from the treatment will be performed prior to each treatment session on weeks
      0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18, and 20.
