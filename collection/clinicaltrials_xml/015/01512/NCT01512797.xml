      The purpose of this study is to assess whether Januvia (sitagliptin phosphate 100mg) is safe
      and effective for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in patients who have had Gastric Bypass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Januvia (sitagliptin phosphate 100mg) is an FDA approved medication for the treatment of
      Type 2 Diabetes. Sitagliptin works by inhibiting the Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme,
      resulting in increased active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. GLP-1 is an incretin
      which increases post-prandial insulin secretion. Because Gastric Bypass has also been shown
      to increase GLP-1 levels, this study seeks to determine the additional effect of DDP-4
      inhibition on glucose control in patients who have elevated incretin levels post Gastric
      Bypass. The study will also assess if Januvia (Sitagliptin phosphate) is safe and well
      tolerated in patients after Gastric Bypass.

      Recruitment and data collection for this study was started at St. Luke's Hospital in New
      York, NY and later moved to Columbia University Medical Center in New York, NY.
