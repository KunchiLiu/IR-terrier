  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 clinical trial with the goal of determining whether the addition of the
      investigational agent BKM120 to vemurafenib will lead to improved 6-month progression-free
      survival in patients with BRAFV600E/K mutant melanoma.

      The phase 1 portion of this trial is a dose escalation study; the phase 2 portion is a
      single-stage, single arm prospective clinical trial. All patients will receive continuous
      doses of vemurafenib twice a day and BKM120 once a day.

      In the phase 1 portion of the study, there will be a 7 day lead-in period to allow for
      single dose pharmacokinetic analysis of BKM120 alone. Cycle 1 (28 days) is the dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) period. During phase 1, vemurafenib and BKM120 doses will be escalated using
      a standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme with the goal of identifying the recommended phase 2
      dose.

      In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients will receive continuous doses of vemurafenib
      and BKM120 starting on day 1 of the first cycle. In the phase 2 portion of the study,
      patients will receive vemurafenib and BKM120 at the recommended phase 2 dose.

             implantable, or injectable contraceptives are therefore not considered effective for
             this study

               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six

                  without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone,
                  only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up
                  hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

                  of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during treatment
                  for 3 months in total after study drug discontinuation. Highly effective
                  contraception is defined as either: True abstinence-when this is in line with
                  the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, periodic abstinence and
                  withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception; Sterilization-have had
                  surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation
                  at least six weeks ago; Male partner sterilization-for female subjects, the
                  vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient; Use of a
                  combination of any two of the following barrier methods of contraception-condom
                  or Occlusive cap with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

                  offspring must use condom during treatment, for 3 months in total after study
                  drug discontinuation and should not father a child in this period

         22. Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

         23. History of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured or curable basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix; patients with lesions curable by excision must have these lesions excised
             prior to the initiation of treatment on study

         24. Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with
             the investigator
