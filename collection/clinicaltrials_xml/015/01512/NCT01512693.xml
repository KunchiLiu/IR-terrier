  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized study was designed to compare pharmacokinetics of a single
      50 milligram (mg) dose of MK-0822 in participants with and without moderate hepatic
      insufficiency (abnormal liver function) in order to determine to what degree hepatic
      dysfunction may impact therapeutic blood levels of MK-0822.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Curve from Zero (0) Hours to Infinity (AUC (0-∞)) After Single Dose MK-0822</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of administration of MK-0822, defined as 0 hours on Study Day 1, to 336 hours (postdose on Post Study Day 15) (Interim postdose blood draws are scheduled at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, and 240 hours).</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0∞) is defined as: area under the plasma (serum) concentration-time curve from zero to infinity. For this study, pre-determined blood-draw time points will range from 0 hours, at time of administration of MK-0822 on Study Day 1, to 336 hours on Post-Study Day 15.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Plasma Concentration (C (max)) After Single Dose MK-0822</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of administration of MK-0822, defined as 0 hours on Study Day 1, to 336 hours (postdose on Post Study Day 15) (Interim postdose blood draws are scheduled at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, and 240 hours).</time_frame>
    <description>C (max) is defined as: the peak plasma (serum) concentration of a therapeutic drug. For this study, pre-determined blood-draw time points will range from 0 hours, at time of administration of MK-0822 on Study Day 1, to 336 hours on Post-Study Day 15.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (T (max)) After Single Dose MK-0822</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of administration of MK-0822, defined as 0 hours on Study Day 1, to 336 hours (postdose on Post Study Day 15) (Interim postdose blood draws are scheduled at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, and 240 hours).</time_frame>
    <description>T (max) is defined as the time it takes the administered drug to reach maximum (peak) plasma (serum) concentration. For this study, pre-determined blood-draw time points will range from 0 hours, at time of administration of MK-0822 on Study Day 1, to 336 hours on Post-Study Day 15.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Terminal Half-Life (t(½)) After Single Dose MK-0822</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of administration of MK-0822, defined as 0 hours on Study Day 1, to 336 hours (postdose on Post Study Day 15) (Interim postdose blood draws are scheduled at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, and 240 hours).</time_frame>
    <description>Apparent terminal half-life is the time required to divide the plasma (serum) concentration by two after reaching pseudo-equilibrium. (Note: it is not the time required to eliminate half the administered dose.) For this study, pre-determined blood-draw time points will range from 0 hours, at time of administration of MK-0822 on Study Day 1, to 336 hours on Post-Study Day 15.</description>

    <description>Eight (8) participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency will be screened to ensure that they meet study criteria prior to receiving one 50 milligram (mg) dose of MK-0822. After administration of the MK-0822, the participants will undergo timed and sequential blood draws through post-study, Day 15. The resulting assays will provide pharmacokinetic measurements and will aid in the assessment of overall exposure associated with MK-0822-070.</description>
