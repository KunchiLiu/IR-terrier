  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Domperidone in those
      mothers who are identified as having difficulty with breast milk production to meet the
      nutritional needs of their infant in the neonatal intensive are unit (NICU) hospitalization
      setting, and to determine how it should be considered in the care of mothers and their
      preterm infants without causing undesirable effects to either the mother or infant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is widely acknowledged that recent perinatal and neonatal technological advances (eg.
      assisted ventilation, surfactant, antenatal corticosteroids) have greatly enhanced the
      survival rate of very low birth weight (VLBW) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants.
      A compelling body of evidence now exists to suggest that use of breast milk to feed preterm
      infants during initial hospitalization positively impacts their neurodevelopment during
      early childhood and beyond. In order to provide breastmilk, mothers of preterm infants have
      to begin to produce and mechanically express milk. However, these mothers are often faced
      with challenges in maintaining an adequate volume that will meet their infants' nutritional
      needs, as well as declines in production after several weeks despite a myriad of measures
      designed to assist in production. The primary hypothesis for this study is that Domperidone,
      through its pharmacologic action on increasing prolactin levels, will assist mothers
      experiencing inadequate breast milk production in increasing breast milk volumes to a level
      identified as being sufficient for continued pumping in the hospitalization period.
