    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the uses of two types of equipment during
      transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT). The two types of surgical devices are:
      the monopolar loop electrocautery and the PlasmaKinetic (PK) Button Vaporization Electrode.
      These two devices do the same task but differ in the way they create electric current when
      removing cancerous tissue. The investigators hope to examine and compare the uses of these
      two surgical devices to see if any advantages do exist or whether they actually are similar.
      The goal of the study will be to prove similarity in outcomes between the two techniques and
      analyze the outcomes resulting from each case.

      This study will study the medical intervention used when bladder cancer patients present
      with a new or recurrent bladder tumor. Currently when patients report these tumors, they
      undergo a standard practice called transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) in
      order to determine the stage of the cancer. This intervention, accomplished by looking
      through the urethra using an endoscope, is both diagnostic and potentially therapeutic. An
      adequately performed TURBT will provide the pathologist with enough tissue to provide tumor
      grade and stage information. Currently, TURBT is done using equipment called monopolar
      electrocautery which is in the form a 90-degree loop electrode. Although usually safe and
      sufficient, this technique can create technical challenges because it can be difficult to
      position the loop electrode in a dynamically changing cylindrical space (the bladder).
      Specifically, especially with larger bladder tumors, intraoperative bleeding can obscure
      visualization and result in incomplete tumor resection as well as inadequate sampling of the
      layers of the bladder needed to establish tumor stage. Furthermore, monopolar current can
      result in stimulation of a nerve (the obturator nerve) during resection of wall tumors,
      resulting in violent movement of the leg which can cause a potential bladder tear as well as
      possible (iliac) vessel injury.

      Conversely, a technique using bipolar energy, which has been available for many years, has
      been readily adopted for the surgical treatment of benign prostatic enlargement. The
      advantages of a bipolar electrical current include the direct return of electrical current
      to the loop rather than to a grounding pad placed on the patient's skin. This has the
      theoretical value of limiting the diffusion of electrical current, and therefore heat, to
      the surrounding tissue. A further refinement on bipolar energy has been the recent
      introduction of a piece of equipment called the PlasmaKinetic (PK) Button Vaporization
      electrode, which is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this
      indication. Coupling bipolar energy into the Button electrode would not only harness the
      benefits of less thermal spread but also would obviate the geometric challenges associated
      with loop electrodes during resection of bladder tumors. Procedural advantages would
      potentially include minimal bleeding, good visualization, and a reduction in the occurrence
      of the obturator reflex and concomitant bladder perforation.

      This study is a randomized double-arm trial examining the results of both techniques for
      bladder cancer TURBT procedures with a minimum of 120 patients at Emory. The purpose of this
      study is to measure the procedural (intraoperative), short term, as clinically indicated
      (4-6 weeks), and long-term (3 months) outcomes of TURBT using the PK Button when compared to
      traditional monopolar loop electrocautery. The goal of the study will be to prove
      equivalence in outcomes between the two techniques.

The expected rate of composite complications is 10-15%. If one or more of the aforementioned complications occur, then the case will be recorded to have a complication.</description>

    <description>The current treatment standard of care for patients who present de novo or with a recurrent bladder tumor is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) using monopolar electrocautery in the form a 90-degree loop electrode and has been used since its introduction in 1952. This intervention, accomplished endoscopically through the urethra, is both diagnostic and potentially therapeutic. An adequately performed TURBT will provide the pathologist with enough tissue to provide tumor grade and stage information.</description>

    <description>Bipolar energy has been available for many years and has been readily adopted for the surgical treatment of benign prostatic enlargement and may provide advantages and solutions to the technical challenges of monopolar electrocautery. A further refinement on bipolar energy has been the recent introduction of the PlasmaKinetic (PK) Button Vaporization electrode which will be used in the intervention arm of this study. This electrode is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication as well. The semi-spherical design of the electrode creates a plasma arc that glides over the tissue, transmitting energy to the cell layers adjacent to the arc which are then quickly vaporized.</description>
