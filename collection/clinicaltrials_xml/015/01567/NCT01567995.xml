    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, two treatment arms, vehicle (cream base)
      -controlled, parallel-group study in subjects with moderate to severe eczema (defined by
      investigators global assessment (IGA) score greater than or equal to 3).

      Subjects were screened within 3 days prior to randomization. At the screen visit, subjects
      gave informed consent and were then assessed for health status and eligibility for inclusion
      in the study. At the baseline visit, subject eligibility was assessed for randomization (Day
      0). Eligible subjects were randomised to Clobetasone Butyrate 0.05% Cream group or vehicle
      (cream base) group at the rate of 1:1. During the treatment phase, subjects returned to the
      sites in day 7 post-baseline visit for assessment of their disease status and eligibility to
      continue on the study. During the final visit, 14 days after the baseline, subjects returned
      to the study sites for assessment of their disease status before completing the study. In
      addition, the safety and tolerability of Clobetasone Butyrate 0.05% cream were also assessed
      through the whole trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of eczema, fulfil the 3 follow items: 1) Erythema,
             papilla/water blister, Lichenification, skin damage with infiltration, 2) unknown
             reason, recurrent attacks; 3) itching in diseased skin

          -  Subjects must have body surface area (BSA) disease involvement of less than or equal
             to 10% as assessed by palm method

          -  Subject must present with moderate and above eczema as defined by a score greater
             than or equal to 3 using the investigators global assessment (IGA) of eczema
             severity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject presents with any systemic disorder or active skin disease (e.g.
             psoriasis) that would in any way confound interpretation of the study results or
             subjects who present with scars, moles, tattoos, body piercings, sunburn in the test
             area which could interfere with the assessment of lesions at screening.

          -  The subject has eczema restricted to the face, the feet or the hands only.

          -  The subject is indicated any anti-infectives drug for a current complication of overt
             bacterial, fungal and viral infection

          -  History of recent (&lt;1 month) active or presence of current superficial skin
             infections of viral aetiology such as herpes simplex, or varicella.

             agents administered in the diseased skin, including emollient - 1 week; Systemic
             administration of anti-histamine agents - 2 week; Systemic administration of
             corticosteroid -4 week; Systemic administration of immunosuppressive drugs - 4 week;
             UV therapy -4 week

          -  Foreseeable intensive ultraviolet (UV) exposure during the study (solar or
             artificial). Subjects must not be exposed to intense direct sunlight for long
             periods, and must not use skin tanning devices (e.g. sunbed) for the duration of the
             study.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, liver,
             neurological, renal or haematological abnormalities.

          -  History of allergy to components of test medications to be used in the study.
