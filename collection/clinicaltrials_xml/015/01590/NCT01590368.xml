  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesised that the adhesion of electrodes and acceptability of the
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) trace is comparable between the two groups (marketed and test
      products) after 30 minutes (the intended period of use) of the electrodes.

          -  Be a healthy volunteer and be over 18 years of age

          -  Willing to attend two scheduled visits for application and removal of the device and

          -  Subjects who are actively involved in the development, manufacturing, quality and
             marketing of Unomedical electrodes

          -  Subjects who have any other medical condition which, according to the investigator
             justifies exclusion from the study
