    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the clinical superiority and the safety of topical
      pexiganan cream 0.8% plus standard local wound care, as compared to placebo cream plus
      standard local wound care, in the treatment of mildly infected diabetic foot ulcers.
