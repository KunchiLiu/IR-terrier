  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenosine is used clinically to assess permanency of electrical isolation of pulmonary veins
      during atrial fibrillation ablation, however, the methodology has not been validated either
      in terms of the reproducibility of the adenosine response or the effect on clinical
      outcomes, namely whether using pulmonary vein reconnection to guide additional ablation
      lowers rate recurrent atrial fibrillation post ablation. Study will test the hypothesis that
      the response to adenosine used in this manner is reproducible over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation as part of atrial fibrillation ablation will be
      randomized to treatment and control groups. Treatment group subjects will received 12 mg IV
      adenosine to evaluate pulmonary vein reconnection after initial electrical isolation is
      documented. If electrical reconnection is not observed at 5 minutes, a second dose of
      adenosine will be administered, monitoring again for electrical reconnection. Control
      patients will be observed for 10 minutes post initial electrical isolation of the pulmonary
      vein for spontaneous electrical reconnection. If reconnection is observed, veins will be
      re-isolated per standard clinical practice. This procedure will be repeated for each of a
      patient's pulmonary veins. Patients will be followed up at clinical visits to examine for
      adverse effects of procedure and/or adenosine administration as well as atrial fibrillation
      recurrence.
