  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the expansion of Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) primary prevention indications, the number
      of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) implants has increased significantly in the
      recent years. This has resulted in an increase of the number of follow-up (FU) to be
      performed and a growing workload for centers. Remote FU system such as the Medtronic
      Carelink system allows to check remotely the proper functioning of self evaluating devices
      and give informations of some clinical events.

      The objective of this study is to define which patients with a remote follow-up need
      additional onsite visit and to assess to which extent remote FU can be an alternative to
      onsite visit.

    <description>Evaluate the sensibility and specificity of remote follow-up data to predict the need of an onsite visit
Sensibility is defined as follows:
Number of cases where remote FU data analysis has shown reliably the need of an onsite visit divided by the total number of cases where an onsite was needed as defined per protocol.
Specificity is defined as follows:
Number of cases where remote FU data analysis has shown reliably that there was no need for an onsite visit divided by the total number of cases where there was no need for an onsite visit.</description>
