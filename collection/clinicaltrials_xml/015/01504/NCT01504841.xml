  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are widely used as part of
      combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) for infants and children, but NNRTI resistance is
      increasing, leading to treatment failure. This study will test the safety, tolerability, and
      dosing levels of etravirine (ETR), a new NNRTI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Use of NNRTI-based regimens as initial therapy for HIV-infected children is increasing,
      especially in areas where newborns exposed to HIV-1 receive single-dose nevirapine (NVP) as
      part of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) regimens and/or daily NVP for
      prevention of transmission through breastfeeding. First-generation NNRTIs have a low genetic
      barrier to the development of resistance; in two of the most widely used NNRTIs, NVP and
      efavirenz (EFV), even a single amino acid mutation in the virus can lead to a reduction in
      the drug's effectiveness. Even short-term use of these NNRTIs, including only a single dose
      of NVP, can cause NNRTI resistance. Second-generation NNRTIs are needed as part of ARV
      regimens for newly diagnosed infants and children who have been exposed to single-dose NVP
      or who have failed their current antiretroviral (ARV) regimens. In this study, the
      second-generation NNRTI ETR will be tested for safety, tolerability, and appropriate dosing.

      Children will be assigned to one of three cohorts based on age:

        -  Cohort I: At least 2 but younger than 6 years of age

        -  Cohort II: At least 1 but younger than 2 years of age

        -  Cohort III: At least 2 months but less than 1 year of age

      Children in all cohorts will be treatment experienced, defined as being on a failing
      combination ARV regimen (containing at least 3 ARVs) for at least 8 weeks or having a
      treatment interruption of at least 4 weeks with a history of virologic failure while on a
      combination ARV regimen (containing at least 3 ARVs).

      Children will receive ETR together with an optimized background regimen (OBR) consisting of
      at least 2 active agents (a boosted protease inhibitor [PI] and at least 1 additional active
      ARV drug). OBR will be based on clinical status, treatment history, resistance data, and
      availability of appropriate pediatric dosing and formulations. Some ARVs used as part of the
      OBR may be provided by the study. The children will receive an oral dose of ETR twice daily.

      Most children will have 11 visits: at screening, entry (Day 0), Day 14 (intensive
      pharmacokinetic [PK] visit), and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48. Most visits will
      include a physical exam, giving a medical history, discussion of adherence, and blood and
      urine collection. The screening and intensive PK visits will also include an
      electrocardiogram (ECG). During the intensive PK visit, the child will have blood drawn
      approximately 7 times over 12 hours. After the Week 48 visit, children will enter the
      long-term follow-up phase of the study and will have a visit every 12 weeks for up to 5
      years. These follow-up visits will include giving a medical history and undergoing a
      physical exam and blood draw.
