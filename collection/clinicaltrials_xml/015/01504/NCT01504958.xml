  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the potential benefits of combining cognitive training (mental
      exercises) together with transcranial magnetic stimulation (also known as TMS) to see if
      this can make a difference in the condition of people with Alzheimer's disease by improving
      their disease and the cognitive decline that goes along with it.

      This study takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
      The treatment portion of the study requires patients to visit the BIDMC daily, Monday
      through Friday, for 6 weeks. All participants will receive real cognitive training, but half
      of our participants will receive active TMS treatment and half will receive a placebo TMS
      treatment. However, those receiving the placebo treatment will be offered the real treatment
      upon the completion of the study. This study goes up to approximately 4.5 months.

      TMS is a noninvasive way of stimulating the brain, which is not painful and does not involve
      any needles or any form of surgery. It acts by delivering a magnetic stimulation to a
      particular region of your brain and that, coupled with the cognitive training, is what is
      being looked at in this study. The investigators are examining if this combination of TMS
      and cognitive training will improve your memory function and other mental functions such as
      language, orientation, and thinking or judgment.
