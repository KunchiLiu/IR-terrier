  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The technological progress allowed the development of more and more sophisticated
      pacemakers, widening the therapeutic indications but also meeting the physiological needs of
      the patient. This progress led to a more and more complex programming for the physicians. To
      help them set optimally the pacing parameters, physicians refer to the existing
      recommendations of learned societies as well as to his expertise. Manufacturers developed
      also algorithms integrated into pacemakers with the aim of assisting physicians in their
      programming.

      TherapyGuide is a function which proposes a programming adapted to the psychopathological
      state of the patient, with a justification based on experts' consensus, clinical studies as
      well as on published articles.

      Physicians have the choice to accept or reject the programming proposed by TherapyGuide.
      When rejected, there is no means to analyze the modifications brought to the proposed set of
      parameters. The nature, the frequency and the reasons of these modifications are not thus
      known.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the acceptance of the TherapyGuide proposals by
      physicians and to identify the most frequent type of programming changes they make and their
      rationale.

    <description>The primary objective is to assess the acceptance of the TherapyGuide proposals by the physicians and to define the most frequent type of modifications done when not accepted.
Acceptance will be assessed by measuring the proportion of cases where physicians programmed the set of parameters recommended by the TherapyGuide with no modifications.</description>
