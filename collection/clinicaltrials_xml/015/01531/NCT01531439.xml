  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There will be two groups in this study: one group will be given the standard infusion of
      naloxone, a drug which helps reduce side effects from opioids needed after surgery, and the
      other group will receive a higher dose. The trial is designed to determine if a higher dose
      of naloxone infusion will reduce side effects from opioid therapy in patients who have
      undergone spine fusion for scoliosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients undergoing spinal fusion for scoliosis are routinely given patient
      controlled analgesia (PCA) for pain control postoperatively. PCA therapy is typically
      combined with an ultra low dose naloxone infusion because of the established benefit of
      reduced pruritis and nausea. The investigators hypothesize that using a higher dose naloxone
      infusion may lead to further improvement in pruritis and nausea and may improve GI function.
      Improvement in bowel function could lead to faster initiation of oral intake as well as
      transition to oral pain medication and even decreased length of stay.
