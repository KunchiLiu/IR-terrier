      This study examines contrast advantages and disadvantages of elective or prophylactic nodal
      irradiation in the treatment of esophageal cancer with three-dimensional conformed
      radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal lymph node drainage area is rich, according to different sites, easy to
      metastasis to different regions. For patient underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy, how
      reasonable design the clinical target volume of lymph node drainage area has always been
      controversial, one is to irradiate positive lymph nodes only, the other is to irradiate the
      easier involved lymph node area according to different sites, in order to contrast
      advantages and disadvantages of the two kind of target area design，so the study was
      designed.
