  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STA9090 is a drug which inactivates or blocks the work of a protein called Heat Shock
      Protein 90 or HSP90. HSP90 is a protein that helps some molecules inside your cells to have
      the right shape. By stopping HSP90's activity, those molecules never get to have the right
      structure of be functional and they are destroyed. The investigators believe that if they
      stop the activity of HSP90, the rapidly dividing cells that are in your tumor(s) may slow
      down. In this research study the investigators are looking to see how well STA9090 works in
      stopping the spread of your melanoma.

    <textblock>
      STA-9090 will be given intravenously over 1 hour. Treatment will be given in cycles which
      last 28 days (4 weeks). Study drug will be given once a week for the first 3 weeks (days 1,
      8 and 15) and not during the last week.

      Subjects will receive a clinical exam, ECG (before and after study drug) and blood tests on
      days when they receive the study drug. In Cycle 1, subjects will have a biopsy and blood
      samples taken on Day 2.

      20 to 30 days after the last study treatment, subjects will have a clinical exam, ECG, blood
      tests, pregnancy test (if applicable), tumor assessment by CT, urine sample and possible
      biopsy.
