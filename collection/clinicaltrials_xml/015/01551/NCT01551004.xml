  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I Trial to determine the safety and
      pharmokinetics of a single dose of CRS3123 in healthy adult volunteers. Forty healthy male
      and female subjects 18 to 45 years will be admitted in 5 dosing Cohorts, 8 subjects per
      Cohort. Up to two alternates may be used per dosing Cohorts for study subjects that drop
      out. The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of CRS3123 following oral administration to healthy subjects. The secondary
      objective is to assess whether there is measurable systemic exposure and if so, to determine
      the plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics of CRS3123 after a single oral dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of CRS3123, a methionyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor.
      Since this is a FIH study of a new class of drugs, the maximum safe starting dose was
      estimated from the NOAEL from preclinical studies in accordance with FDA guidance documents
      (FDA Guidance for Industry, July 2005). A very low starting dose has been chosen. In the
      initial Cohorts, doses of 100, 200 and 400 will be given; all are below the estimated human
      starting dose. If any significant safety signals are encountered, the investigators will
      notify the SMC and call for a review. Dose escalation to Cohorts D and E will require a full
      SMC review of all safety data obtained through Day 7 for the preceding Cohorts. Forty
      healthy male and female subjects 18 to 45 years, inclusive, will be admitted for an
      inpatient study. Each subject will receive a single oral dose of CRS3123 or placebo. There
      will be 8 patients for each cohort (6 active, 2 placebo). The ascending doses are 100, 200,
      400, 800 and 1200 mg respectively for cohorts A through E. The primary outcome measure is
      the safety and tolerability of CRS3123, evaluated by the sequential review of reported
      adverse events, changes from baseline in findings on physical examination, changes from
      baseline in vital sign measurements, safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry,
      urinalysis), and changes from baseline in key ECG findings. The secondary outcome measure is
      the pharmacokinetics of CRS3123 will be determined and compared by measuring plasma and
      urine CRS3123 concentrations before oral administration of CRS3123 and at multiple specified
      time points following dose administration.
