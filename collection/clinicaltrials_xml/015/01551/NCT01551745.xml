    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of Vigil™ autologous tumor cell vaccine integrated with
      bevacizumab. All patients will have had Vigil™ prepared and stored from initial primary
      surgical debulking. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive Vigil™ 1.0 x 10e7
      cells/intradermal injection once every 4 weeks and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every
      2 weeks.
