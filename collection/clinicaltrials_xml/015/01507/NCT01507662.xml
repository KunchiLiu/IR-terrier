  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that patients undergoing bone mineral density testing (BMD) often
      do not take important steps to improve their bone health. The investigators will conduct a
      randomized-controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a novel and practical patient
      activation intervention (mailing patients their bone density test results) on the quality of
      bone-related healthcare and the cost-effectiveness of BMD testing. Equally important, the
      investigators intervention could easily be modified to include other patient populations and
      chronic diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone mineral density (BMD) peaks in early adulthood and declines progressively with aging.
      As BMD declines from normal, to low (formerly called osteopenia), to osteoporosis, risk of
      fractures progressively increases. In an effort to prevent bone loss and reduce fracture
      risk, most widely accepted guidelines including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and
      Surgeon General's Office now recommend BMD screening of older adults using dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA). The rationale for screening is that patients and their providers will
      use DXA results as a &quot;cue to action&quot; and take necessary steps to enhance bone health through
      lifestyle modification (e.g., weight bearing exercise), Calcium/Vitamin D supplementation,
      and pharmacotherapy when indicated. However, multiple studies have demonstrated that
      patients and providers often fail take recommended actions following DXA testing, thus
      defeating much of the purpose of screening. Over the past five years we have systematically
      developed and pilot tested a low-cost and practical patient activation intervention based
      upon the Health Belief Model. The intervention consists of the DXA scanning center mailing
      each patient a customized letter containing the results of their DXA scan plus educational
      information about osteoporosis, supplemented by a follow-up phone call from a nurse
      educator. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the intervention is well received by
      both patients and providers and enhances bone-related quality of care. The overarching
      objective of the current proposal is to rigorously examine the impact of our patient
      activation intervention on bone-related quality of care in adults undergoing screening DXA
      scans through a randomized-controlled trial conducted at three study sites. In addition, we
      will examine the real-world costs associated with our intervention and the impact of our
      intervention on the overall cost-effectiveness of BMD screening. We hypothesize that the
      activation intervention will increase optimization of Calcium/Vitamin D intake, enhance use
      of pharmacotherapy when indicated, will improve patient satisfaction with their bone-related
      healthcare, and improve patients' osteoporosis specific knowledge when compared with usual
      care
