      The objectives of the study are:

        1. To determine the prevalence of externalized conductors at enrollment in Riata®, Riata®
           ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads

        2. To determine the prevalence of other visual lead anomalies (fracture, subclavian crush,
           kink, broken filars on a shocking coil and other irregularities) by each subcategory at
           enrollment in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads

        3. To determine the prevalence of electrical dysfunction at enrollment in Riata®, Riata®
           ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads

        4. To determine the incidence of externalized conductors after enrollment in Riata®,
           Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads

        5. To determine the incidence of other visual lead anomalies by each subcategory after
           enrollment in Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads

        6. To determine the incidence of electrical dysfunction after enrollment in Riata®, Riata®
           ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex® and Durata® leads.

        7. To evaluate the 30-day adverse event rate associated with lead revision procedures
           (include lead extractions or abandonments with or without lead replacement) in Riata®,
           Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex®, and Durata® families of leads

        8. To determine the prevalence of &quot;other insulation anomalies&quot; in &quot;returned leads&quot; for
           Riata®, Riata® ST Silicone, QuickSite®/QuickFlex®, and Durata® families of leads.
           &quot;Other insulation anomalies&quot; include any of the following:

             -  Internal abrasion short under RV shock coil

             -  Internal abrasion short under SVC shock coil

             -  Exposed conductors defined as a breach of the outer insulation

             -  Breach of the internal silicone lumen tubing, but the conductor cable is contained
                within the lead body diameter.
