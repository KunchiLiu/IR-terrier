  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving oxaliplatin
      or mitomycin C directly into the abdomen after surgery works in treating patients with
      tumors of the appendix. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin and mitomycin C,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Heating a chemotherapy solution and infusing it directly into
      the abdomen may kill more tumor cells. Giving these treatments after surgery may kill any
      tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the toxicity profiles within 4 weeks of surgery of oxaliplatin and mitomycin C
      delivered via Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in patients with peritoneal surface
      malignancies from primary appendiceal tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the time to progression in patients treated with oxaliplatin vs. mitomycin C
      delivered via Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for surface malignancies from
      primary appendiceal tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients undergo surgical cytoreduction and receive mitomycin C by hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).

      Arm II: Patients undergo surgical cytoreduction and receive oxaliplatin by HIPEC.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36
      months.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or double-barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of
             study participation and for 90 days following HIPEC

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             (either directly or via a legally authorized representative)

          -  Participants who have received oxaliplatin during prior systemic chemotherapy
             regimens are eligible for enrollment in this protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an active infection or with a fever &gt;= 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit (F)
             within 3 days of the first scheduled day of protocol treatment

          -  Patients who are receiving concurrent investigational therapy or who have received
             investigational therapy within 30 days of HIPEC (investigational therapy is defined
             as treatment for which there is currently no regulatory authority approved
             indication)

          -  Patients with carcinoid tumors

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) metastases

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of oxaliplatin or
             mitomycin C

          -  History of prior malignancy within the past 5 years, except for curatively treated
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia, or localized
             prostate cancer with a current prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of &lt; 1.0 mg/dL on 2
             successive evaluations, at least 3 months apart, with the most recent evaluation no
             more than 4 weeks prior to entry

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             study requirements

          -  Pregnant/nursing women are excluded from this study because oxaliplatin is an agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with oxaliplatin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with oxaliplatin or mitomycin C

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C-positive patients (active,

          -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt;= grade 2

          -  History of allogenic transplant
