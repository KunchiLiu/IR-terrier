    <textblock>
      In the present study, the investigators will examine and determine whether pomegranate
      extract benefits cognitive abilities in middle-aged and older non-demented volunteers. More
      specifically, the investigators will test the following primary hypothesis:

        1. Non-demented volunteers aged 50-75 who receive a daily dietary supplement of
           pomegranate extract will show improved cognitive performance compared to baseline
           versus those receiving a placebo after one, six, and twelve months.

           The investigators will also explore the following secondary hypothesis:

        2. Cognitive change in the pomegranate intervention group will vary according to genotypes
           found to influence age-related cognitive decline (i.e., apolipoprotein E [APOE]).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the primary hypothesis, up to 212 non-demented subjects will be enrolled. Subjects
      will be randomized, using a double-blind design, to one of two treatment groups: supplement
      (1,000 mg pomegranate extract per day) or placebo, and followed for 12 months.
      Neuropsychological assessments will determine cognitive change, and be repeated at 1, 6 and
      12 months. All subjects will receive a baseline assessment (clinical examination, MRI scan,
      and screening laboratory tests) in order to exclude volunteers with dementia or other
      conditions that might influence results. We will draw additional blood for freezing and
      possible later assessment of inflammatory measures to explore whether pomegranate extract
      has effects on measures of inflammation. These samples will only be analyzed if we find that
      the extract shows cognitive benefits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Agreement to participate in the 12-month double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
             trial of pomegranate extract.

          -  Nondemented subjects either those with normal cognition or with amnestic Mild
             Cognitive Impairment will be included.

          -  Age 50 to 75 years.

          -  No significant cerebrovascular disease: modified Ischemic Score of &lt; 4 (Rosen et al,
             1980).

          -  Adequate visual and auditory acuity to allow neuropsychological testing.

          -  Screening laboratory tests and EKG without significant abnormalities that might
             interfere with the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) or any other dementia (e.g., vascular,
             Lewy body, frontotemporal) (McKhann et al, 1984). Evidence of other neurological or
             physical illness that can produce cognitive deterioration. Volunteers with a history
             of stroke, TIA, carotid bruits, or lacunes on MRI scans will be excluded.
             Determination of dementia will be based on the clinical evaluation including
             assessment of functional abilities, and cognitive screening.
