    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Researchers have been studying patterns of mood and drug use in specific neighborhoods.
      This study will look at environmental factors that may affect drug use, addiction, and
      treatment seeking in Baltimore neighborhoods. The results could inform prevention efforts,
      enhance treatment interventions, and improve substance use outcomes.

      Objectives:

      - To better understand why some people start to use drugs, why some people who use drugs
      become addicted, and why some people who become addicted enter treatment.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are living in the neighborhoods participating in
      the study.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will be
           separated into one of four groups: (1) people who do not use drugs, (2) people who have
           used drugs in the past, (3) people who are using drugs and want treatment, and (4)
           people who are using drugs and do not want treatment.

        -  This study will include two outpatient visits about 12 months apart. Each visit will
           last about 5 hours. Each study visit may be done in 1 day or in 2 days.

        -  At each study visit, participants will provide blood, breath, urine, and saliva
           samples. They will also have a heart function test and body measurements. They will
           complete questionnaires about personal and family history.

        -  There will be monthly follow-up phone calls between the two visits.

      PHASE B - ENROLLMENT BEGIN JANUARY 2016

      Background: The reasons for initiation and continuation of use of illicit substances are
      multifactorial; however, some individuals appear resistant to both. One set of determinants
      lies in the environment. In ongoing studies, we are examining environmental concomitants of
      behavior in individuals in drug treatment. In this study, we will examine environmental
      factors that may impact initiation, addiction, and treatment seeking among the greater
      population at large (non-drug-users, current opioid/stimulant users, and current marijuana
      users).

      Scientific goals: (1) To assess, cross-sectionally at baseline, differences in stress,
      social stability, and mental and physical health among three main neighborhood-matched
      groups of current opioid/stimulant users, current marijuana users, and nondrug users; (2) to
      assess, longitudinally, mediators of 12-month changes in drug-misuse status in the same
      three groups; (3) to provide neighborhood-matched control groups of non-drug-using
      individuals, Unclassified/former drug users, and current opioid/stimulant drug users not
      seeking treatment for our ongoing environmental studies of individuals in drug treatment;
      (4) to explore the possible role of genetics and its interplay with environment in regards
      to drug use initiation, addiction, and treatment seeking among the study groups, and (5) to
      assess EMA reports of drug use and psychosocial stress as well as real-time environmental
      risk exposure in a non-treatment seeking and/or nondrug using population and compare to our
      ongoing environmental studies of individuals in drug treatment,

      Participant population: We will enroll 500 participants in Phase B of the study for a total
      enrollment (Phase A + Phase B) of 1250 participants. Target enrollment will include 25%
      women and 70% minorities (mostly African-American).

      Experimental design and methods: This is a three-group observational study with a
      cross-sectional component and a longitudinal component: each participant will be assessed in
      two visits spaced approximately 12 months apart. The three main groups will be: (1)
      non-drug-users (NDUs), (2) current opioid/stimulant users [(COSUs) comprised of two
      subgroups: treatment seeking (COSU-TS) and non-treatment seeking (COSU-NTS)], and current
      marijuana users (CMUs). All groups will be roughly matched for socioeconomic status and
      neighborhoods of residence. Each participant will attend a 3-5-hour initial study visit and
      a 3-5-hour 12 month visit #2. The study visits will include a questionnaire component and a
      biological-sample component. Questionnaires will cover substance use, stress, social
      stability (including healthcare access/utilization, and neighborhood environment), physical
      and mental health (including quality of life, HIV, and trauma). The biological component
      will consist of samples of urine (for drugs of abuse and cotinine), breath (for alcohol and
      carbon monoxide). Blood for genetics will be obtained at Visit 1 or Visit 2. The primary
      outcome measures will be lifetime substance-misuse history (cross-sectional component) and
      changes in drug-use status across the 12 months between visits (longitudinal component).
      Secondary outcome measures will include: biological assessments of drug use; medical,
      psychiatric, social determinants of health; and impulsivity and decision making factors.
      Individuals who choose not return for a 12-month Visit #2 will be asked to complete a
      45-minute telephone visit #2. In the HON EMA/GMA secondary study participants will carry a
      smartphone and a GPS unit (if necessary) for up to 4 weeks after completing Visit 1.
      Event-triggered entries will be initiated by participants (1) each time that they use a drug
      (COSU) or marijuana and/or alcohol (NDU, CMU, and Unclassified) and (2) each time they feel
      overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed more than usual. Participants will also make 5
      random-signal-triggered recordings per day and one brief end of day recording. During this
      study participants will also come to the clinic once a week to complete compliance visits.

      Benefits to participants and/or society: There are no benefits to participants. The
      knowledge gained may benefit society by providing data on the health outcomes of drug-using
      and non-drug-using individuals and the natural history of drug use by neighborhood.

      Risks to participants: This is a minimal-risk study, consisting of standard physical and
      questionnaire-based assessments.

      PHASE A ENROLLMENT END DECEMBER 2015

      Background. The reasons for initiation and continuation of use of illicit substances are
      multifactorial; however, some individuals appear resistant to both. One set of determinants
      lies in the environment. In ongoing studies, we are examining environmental concomitants of
      behavior in individuals in drug treatment. In this study, we will examine environmental
      factors that may impact initiation, addiction, and treatment seeking among the greater
      population at large (non-drug-users, former drug users, current opioid/stimulant users
      seeking treatment, current opioid/stimulant users not seeking treatment, and current
      marijuana users). Using the same participants, we will also investigate lipid biomarkers as
      predictors of relapse; this portion of the study will be a collaboration with preclinical
      investigators who have identified a possible lipid fingerprint of cocaine sensitization. The
      results could inform prevention efforts, enhance treatment interventions, and improve
      substance use outcomes.

      Scientific goals: (1) To assess, cross-sectionally at baseline, differences in stress,
      social stability, and mental and physical health among three neighborhood-matched groups of
      current opioid/stimulant users, current marijuana users, and nondrug users; (2) to assess,
      longitudinally, mediators of 12-month changes in drug-misuse status in the same three
      groups; (3) to provide neighborhood-matched control groups of non-drug-using individuals,
      former drug users, and current drug users not seeking treatment for our ongoing
      environmental studies of individuals in drug treatment; (4) to assess lipid biomarkers as
      predictors of drug relapse with the eventual goal of developing a screening assay that will
      inform the personalization of treatment, (5) to explore the possible role of genetics and
      its interplay with environment in regards to drug use initiation, addiction, and treatment
      seeking among the study groups, and (6) to test blood serum and urine for the presence of
      several disease-associated autoantibodies, including ANCA, ANA, and antiophospholipid
      antibodies, in relation to the presence of levamisole (a common adulterant in cocaine); (7)
      to assess EMA reports of drug use and psychosocial stress as well as real-time environmental
      risk exposure in a non-treatment seeking and/or nondrug using population and compare to our
      ongoing environmental studies of individuals in drug treatment,

      Participant population: We will enroll up to 750 community-dwelling individuals (at least
      300 of whom we anticipate will provide 12-month Visit #2 data for our 3 main study groups).
      Target enrollment will include 25% women and 70% minorities (mostly African-American).

      Experimental design and methods: This is a three-group observational study with a
      cross-sectional component and a longitudinal component: each participant will be assessed in
      two visits spaced approximately 12 months apart. The three groups will be: (1)
      non-drug-users (NDUs), (2) current opioid/stimulant users (COSUs), and current marijuana
      users (CMUs). All groups will be roughly matched for socioeconomic status and neighborhoods
      of residence. Each participant will attend a 5-hour initial study visit and a 5-hour 12
      month visit #2. The study visits will include a questionnaire component and a
      biological-sample component. Questionnaires will cover substance use, stress, social
      stability (including healthcare access and utilization), physical and mental health
      (including quality of life, dental health, pain, sexual function, sleep, HIV, trauma). The
      biological component will consist of samples of urine (for drugs of abuse, cotinine,
      microalbumin), breath (for alcohol and carbon monoxide), saliva (for alpha-amylase and
      cortisol), and blood (for liver function, kidney function, HGBA1C, DHEA-S, lipids, CRP,
      pre-albumin, cortisol, and lipid biomarkers). Blood for genetics will be obtained at Visit 1
      or Visit 2. Blood and urine for the levamisole secondary study will be collected at Visit 1
      and/or Visit 2. The primary outcome measures will be lifetime substance-misuse history
      (cross-sectional component) and changes in drug-use status across the 12 months between
      visits (longitudinal component). Secondary outcome measures will include: biological
      assessments of drug use; lipid biomarkers; medical, psychiatric, and social determinants of
      health; hematologic markers corresponding to medical conditions; measure of cumulative
      stress burden (allostatic load); personality assessment; and the relationships among levels
      of autoantibodies, levamisole, and cocaine metabolites. Individuals who choose not return
      for a 12-month Visit #2 will be asked to complete a 45-minute telephone visit #2.
      Individuals in Group 1 (NDU) will also be offered an optional 8-hour laboratory stress
      session (472 Stress Exposure and Response Session A: 472 SEARSA). The 472 SEARSA session
      will occur on a separate day, under a separate consent, and will consist of color-vision
      testing and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT-C), a psychological stressor. The
      472 SEARSA session replicates the 09-DA-N020 Stress Exposure and Response Session A, which
      is conducted with methadone-maintained opioid-dependent participants, and will thereby
      provide a non-drug-using neighborhood-matched control group for comparison of stressor
      reactivity and color vision. In the HON EMA/GMA secondary study participants will carry a
      smartphone and a GPS unit (if necessary) for up to 4 weeks after completing Visit 1.
      Event-triggered entries will be initiated by participants (1) each time that they use a drug
      and (2) each time they feel overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed more than usual. Participants
      will also make 5 random-signal-triggered recordings per day and one brief end of day
      recording. During this study participants will also come to the clinic once a week to
      provide urine and breath samples, complete questionnaires, and upload data from their
      devices.

      Benefits to participants and/or society: There are no benefits to participants. The
      knowledge gained may benefit society by providing data on the health outcomes of drug-using
      and non-drug-using individuals and the natural history of drug use by neighborhood.

      Risks to participants: This is a minimal-risk study, consisting of standard physical and
      questionnaire-based assessments. Participants who undergo the PASAT-C are expected to
      experience only mild, transient stress.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Age at least 18 years. Rationale: Children under 18 will not be included because many
             of the measures to be administered in this study are not validated for use with
             children. Furthermore, the research question under investigation is the drug
             trajectories of adults, over the age of 18. However, there is no intervention in this
             study that is contraindicated for older adults, and given that addiction in the
             elderly is understudied, it is important to include elderly individuals.

          -  Residence in Baltimore city or one of the surrounding counties. Rationale: Our
             current geographic mapping technology currently only includes these areas.
