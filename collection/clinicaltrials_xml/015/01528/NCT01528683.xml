  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment standard for patients with rectal cancer depends on the initial staging and
      includes surgical resection, radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy. For stage II and III
      tumors, radiochemotherapy should be performed in addition to surgery, preferentially as
      preoperative radiochemotherapy or as short-course hypofractionated radiation. Advances in
      surgical approaches, especially the establishment of the total mesorectal excision (TME) in
      combination with sophisticated radiation and chemotherapy have reduced local recurrence
      rates to only few percent. However, due to the high incidence of rectal cancer, still a high
      absolute number of patients present with recurrent rectal carcinomas, and effective
      treatment is therefore needed.

      Carbon ions offer physical and biological characteristics. Due to their inverted dose
      profile and the high local dose deposition within the Bragg peak precise dose application
      and sparing of normal tissue is possible. Moreover, in comparison to photons, carbon ions
      offer an increase relative biological effectiveness (RBE), which can be calculated between 2
      and 5 depending on the cell line as well as the endpoint analyzed.

      Japanese data on the treatment of patients with recurrent rectal cancer previously not
      treated with radiation therapy have shown local control rates of carbon ion treatment
      superior to those of surgery. Therefore, this treatment concept should also be evaluated for
      recurrences after radiotherapy, when dose application using conventional photons is limited.
      Moreover, these patients are likely to benefit from the enhanced biological efficacy of
      carbon ions.

      In the current Phase I/II-PANDORA-01-Study the recommended dose of carbon ion radiotherapy
      for recurrent rectal cancer will be determined in the Phase I part, and feasibility and
      progression-free survival will be assessed in the Phase II part of the study.

      Within the Phase I part, increasing doses from 12 x 3 Gy E to 18 x 3 Gy E will be applied.

      The primary endpoint in the Phase I part is toxicity, the primary endpoint in the Phase II
      part its progression-free survival.

    <description>Phase I part:
The primary endpoint is toxicity measured by any Grade IV toxicity related to the study treatment according to CTCAE Grade 41. A maximum of 45 patients are projected for the Phase I part of the study. Patients will be followed for at least 3 months after study treatment to document any toxicity according to CTCAE Version 4.0.
Phase II part:
The primary endpoint is progression-free survival after re-irradiation at 12 months, therefore patients are followed within the trial protocol for a minimum 12 months after completion of study treatment.</description>
