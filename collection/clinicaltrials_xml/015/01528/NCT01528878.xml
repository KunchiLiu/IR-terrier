      The purpose of this study is to determine a tolerable dose of radiation delivered by the
      CyberKnife system in two groups of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CyberKnife system has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
      treat lesions, tumors and conditions anywhere in the body when radiation treatment is
      indicated. In order to treat tumors during the respiratory cycle (vs. increasing the margin
      of treatment around the tumor to compensate for movement or requiring the patient to breath
      hold during the delivery of each beam), the Synchrony™ option, a system option that enables
      dynamic radiosurgery during respiration, will be used. The purpose of this study is to
      determine a tolerable dose of radiation delivered by the CyberKnife in two groups of
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Group 1: Patients with HCC and Childs A
      cirrhosis, and patients with colorectal liver metastases. Group 2: Patients with Childs B
      cirrhosis. Patients will be irradiated with radiation doses using the CyberKnife system in
      3-5 radiation fractions using guidance from fiducials placed by interventional radiology.
      Treatments will be delivered with standard CyberKnife procedures to account for respiratory
      motion and set up variations. The fiducial location will be the prime determinant of the
      delivery site and respiratory motion and fiducial markers will be placed via percutaneous
      approach by interventional radiology.

    <description>Radiation: Stereotactic Radiosurgery using the CyberKnife System. The CyberKnife system has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat lesions, tumors and conditions, anywhere in the body when radiation treatment is indicated. To address movement of target lesion during the respiratory cycle, the Synchrony™ option will be used.
The Synchrony option precisely tracks tumors in or near the target organ as they move, enabling the highly focused beams of radiation to destroy the tumors with minimal injury to adjacent normal tissue. The Synchrony option records the breathing movements of a patient's chest and combines that information with sequential x-ray pictures of tiny markers inserted inside or in the proximity of the tumor to enable precise delivery of radiation during any point in the respiration cycle. The CyberKnife system with the Synchrony option enables reduced normal tissue exposure by using smaller treatment margins and increased accuracy.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (as defined by biopsy or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) greater
             than 1000ng/dL with appropriate imaging) or liver metastases from colorectal cancer
             or other tumor (as defined by biopsy or elevated CEA or a positive PET scan in
             conjunction with a mass on CT or MRI in a patient with previously resected cancer).
             Patients with at least one measurable liver lesion and no more than 3 are eligible if
             they meet all other eligibility criteria including the dose constraints on the
             composite plan.

          2. ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          3. Patients are not candidates for definitive surgical resection because of tumor
             location, hepatic function, or other medical or personal reasons.

          4. Patients with HCC who are being considered for liver transplant may be entered as a
             bridge to transplant if it is considered by the transplant team that an ablative
             therapy would be of value while awaiting transplant.

          5. If cirrhosis is present, patients will have Child-Pugh score of A or B (see Appendix
             A in the Master Protocol).

          6. Patients will have tumors not optimally treated with radio-frequency ablation by
             interventional radiology, or by GI/transplant surgery. This could be for reasons of
             size, tumor location, or other reasons.

          7. Ability to place fiducial markers in the vicinity of the tumor to allow for
             radiographic tracking of respiratory motion and tumor localization. Fiducial
             placement will generally be done by interventional radiology.

          8. Estimates of hepatic tolerance must meet the criteria as defined in Section III. This
             eligibility will not be able to made definitively until the patient has agreed to
             participate. in the study and the appropriate scan analyses and dosimetry have been
             performed. No more than one decrement in dose from the planned dose level will be
             allowed for an individual patient because of exceeding the maximal liver doses before
             the patient is declared ineligible for study.

          9. Adequate bone marrow and renal function as assessed by the following:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/mm3

               -  Platelet count &gt; 80,000/mm3

               -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL OR Creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min based on
                  Cockcroft-Gault formula).

         10. Patients with extra hepatic metastatic disease are eligible if it is the opinion of
             the treating physician that local therapy to the liver may produce worthwhile
             clinical benefits

         11. Patient is able to understand fully the potential risks and benefits of this approach
             and signs an appropriate informed consent.

         12. Male and female of &gt;18 years of age. Male or female patients capable of reproduction
             must agree to use medically acceptable methods of contraception, such as an
             intrauterine device, diaphragm, with spermicide, condom with spermicide or
             abstinence. Inclusion of females of childbearing potential requires a negative
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to study initiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Child-Pugh Class C cirrhosis

          2. Patients with clinically apparent CNS disease.

          3. Medical or psychiatric illness that would not allow the patient to tolerate the
             proposed treatment including inability to lie flat for an extended period of time,
             severe claustrophobia or other reasons.

          4. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease including: myocardial infarction
             within 6 months, uncontrolled angina within 6 months, Class III-IV New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) congestive heart failure, grade 3 cardiac valve dysfunction

          5. Evidence of decompensated liver disease as evidenced by: clinically significant
             ascites refractory to diuretic therapy) evidence of hepatic encephalopathy,
             coagulopathy not corrected by conservative measures.

          6. A history of CTC Grade 3 bleeding esophageal or gastric varices within the past 2
             months. Prior variceal bleed permitted if patient has undergone banding or
             sclerotherapy and there has been no evidence of bleeding for 2 months. Patients at
             risk for varices (based on the following: known history of esophageal or gastric
             varices; evidence of hepatic cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension including
             biopsy-proven cirrhosis, hypersplenism, or radiographic findings of varices) will be
             screened for esophageal varices. If varices are identified that require intervention
             (banding), patient will not be eligible until varices adequately treated.

          7. Prisoners or patients who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness must
             not be enrolled into this study.

          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness.

          9. Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

         10. A patient with Child-Pugh Class A will not be eligible for study if the liver dose
             constraint described in Section 3.2 cannot be met after two decrements in dose per
             fraction as described above.

         11. A patient with Child-Pugh Class B will not be eligible for study if the liver dose
             constraint described in Section 3.2 cannot be met after two decrements in dose per
             fraction as described above.
