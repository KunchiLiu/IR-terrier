      This is a four-week, Phase IIa, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center
      study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of switching subjects from
      stable rhEPO to GSK1278863 in approximately 68 hemodialysis-dependent subjects with anemia
      associated with chronic kidney disease. The study consists of a screening phase of 2 weeks,
      a 4-week treatment phase and a 2-week follow-up phase. The range of Hgb values for study
      eligibility is 9.5-12.0 g/dL and the subjects must have received the same rhEPO product with
      total weekly doses that varied by no more than 50% during the 4 weeks prior to the Screening
      visit (Week -1. This study aims to estimate the relationship between dose of GSK1278863 and
      Hgb response in hemodialysis-dependent (HDD) subjects with anemia associated with chronic
      kidney disease after switching from a stable maintenance dose of recombinant human
      erythropoetin (rhEPO).

      This is a four-week, Phase IIa, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center
      study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of switching subjects from
      stable rhEPO to GSK1278863 in approximately 68 hemodialysis-dependent subjects with anemia
      associated with chronic kidney disease. The study consists of a screening phase of 2 weeks,
      a 4-week treatment phase and a 2-week follow-up phase. The range of Hgb values for study
      eligibility is 9.5-12.0 g/dL and the subjects must have received the same rhEPO product with
      total weekly doses that varied by no more than 50% during the 4 weeks prior to the Screening
      visit (Week -1. Eligible subjects, stratified by their prior rhEPO dose will be randomized
      in equal proportions to receive double-blind GSK1278863 0.5 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg QD (after
      discontinuing their rhEPO), or to continue to receive their existing type and dose of rhEPO
      (epoetins or their biosimilars, or darbepoetin). Study treatment will be stopped if Hgb
      values fall outside of the protocol pre-specified ranges. Subject completion is defined as
      completion of all study phases including the follow-up phase.

      This study aims to estimate the relationship between dose of GSK1278863 and Hgb response in
      hemodialysis-dependent (HDD) subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease
      after switching from a stable maintenance dose of recombinant human erythropoetin (rhEPO).
      In addition, the study will characterize the effect of GSK1278863 on various pharmacokinetic
      (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, and will investigate the safety and tolerability of
      GSK1278863.

      An early interim analysis of the Hgb data is planned after approximately 20 subjects from
      cohort 1 have completed 3 weeks of treatment. Depending upon the interim findings, a second
      cohort of subjects may be added to investigate an additional GSK1278863 dose arm.
      Recruitment to the first cohort will continue during the interim analysis.

      A second interim analysis is planned after approximately 48 subjects from cohort 1 have
      completed 4 weeks treatment. The purpose of this interim is three-fold, to investigate if a
      second cohort of subjects may be added, to facilitate early development of dose-response and
      PK/PD statistical models, and to generate interim results to facilitate design and dosing
      decisions for the next trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age and weight: &gt;/=18 years of age and &gt;/=45 kg (weight post-dialysis).

          2. On three times weekly hemodialysis for at least 8 weeks, irrespective of eGFR values
             and stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

          3. A single-pool Kt/Vurea of &gt;/=1.2 based on a historical value obtained within the
             prior month in order to ensure the adequacy of dialysis. If Kt/Vurea is not
             available, then an average of the last 2 values of urea reduction ratio (URR) of at
             least 65%.

          4. rhEPO use: Using the same rhEPO (epoetins or darbepoetin) with total weekly doses
             that varied by no more than 50% during the prior 4 weeks (i.e., maximum vs. minimum
             total weekly doses &lt;/=50%).

          5. Hgb concentrations 9.5-12.0 g/dL (inclusive).

          6. Vitamin B12 above the lower limit of the reference range (may rescreen in two
             months).

          7. Folate: &gt;/= 2.0 ng/mL (may rescreen in one month).

          8. Ferritin: &gt;/=40 ng/mL with the absence of microcytic or hypochromic RBCs.

          9. Transferrin saturation (TSAT): Within the reference range.

         10. Iron replacement therapy: Stable maintenance dose of oral iron replacement therapy,
             if required, that will be maintained throughout the study. NOTE: IV iron replacement
             therapy is not allowed the two weeks prior to Screening through the end of the study
             (Week 6).

         11. QTc: QTcB &lt;470 msec or QTcB &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle branch block obtained
             at Screening Visit (based on Central Reader's interpretation).

         12. Females: Eligible to participate if she is of childbearing potential, and must agree
             to use one of the approved contraception methods from Screening until completion of
             the Follow-up Visit OR of non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal
             females with a documented tubal ligation of hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined
             as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with
             simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&gt;40MIU/ml and estradiol &lt;40pg/ml is
             confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) whose menopausal status
             is in doubt will be required to use one of the approved contraception methods if they
             wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise they must discontinue HRT to
             allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms
             of HRT, at least 2 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood
             draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of
             their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
             of a contraceptive method.

         13. Males: Must agree to use one of the approved contraceptive methods from the time of
             Screening until completion of the Follow-up Visit.

                  medication(s) before screening and dialysis.

         11. Thrombotic Disease: History of thrombotic disease (e.g., venous thrombosis such as
             deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or arterial thrombosis such as new onset
             or worsening limb ischemia requiring intervention), or other thrombosis related
