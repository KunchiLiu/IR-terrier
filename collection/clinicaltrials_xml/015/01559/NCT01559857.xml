  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how an insulin sensitizing medication, Pioglitazone, can
      cause changes in mood in some depressed patients. Study participants receive assessment of
      their cognitive and metabolic functioning.

      If they meet criteria, they will be asked to take either Pioglitazone or a placebo for a
      90-day trial. Participants will undergo an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test to measure fasting
      insulin and glucose levels, as well as routine blood testing.

      The investigators hope to quantify the role of Pioglitazone in patients with mood disorders
      and compare the values to those previously obtained in a healthy age-matched control
      population. The investigators also hope to examine the association between IR and cognitive
      performance and clinical course of depression in patients with mood disorders.
