      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of rituximab
      in IgG4-RD.

    <textblock>
      This two-center trial will enroll at total of 30 patients with IgG4-RD. The two
      participating sites are the Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA) and the Mayo Clinic
      (Rochester, MN). All patients will receive rituximab 1 gram intravenously times two doses,
      separated by approximately 15 days. The primary efficacy outcome - disease remission and
      successful completion of the glucocorticoid taper - will be assessed at six months. Patients
      will be followed on the protocol for an additional six months after measurement of the
      primary outcome.

    <description>Disease Response at six months is the primary endpoint in this trial. The ability to maintain disease remission off glucocorticoids is an important clinical measure in this disease.
Disease Response - Disease Response is defined at 6 months as:
Improvement of &gt; 2 points in the IgG4-RD RI over baseline
No glucocorticoid or other immunosuppressive drug use between months 4 and 6
No disease flares, as assessed by the IgG4-RD Responder Index.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be included in the trial based on the following disease-specific criteria:

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Diagnosis of IgG4-RD, based upon either pathological criteria* (for those who have
             undergone biopsies) or clinical criteria.** The criteria for pathological and
             clinical diagnoses are specified below.

               -  The subject can be either steroid-naive, in relapse, steroid dependent, or
                  refractory to steroids. Subjects who are steroid dependent or refractory are
                  eligible for enrollment if steroid dose has not been increased in the past 2
                  weeks, and their treating physician plans to withdraw steroids completely (by
                  dose taper) within 8 weeks of starting rituximab.

                    -  Pathological diagnosis:

                         -  Histopathologic features consisting of a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate
                            and storiform fibrosis within involved organs. Other histopathologic
                            features consistent with IgG4-RD (e.g., obliterative phlebitis) may be
                            present but are not required.

                         -  Either an IgG4/IgG plasma cell ratio of &gt; 50% within the affected
                            organs or more than 10 IgG4-bearing plasma cells per high-power field.

        All patients with pathologic diagnoses will have their specimens reviewed by pathology
        investigators.

        **Clinical diagnosis:

        â€¢ Organ involvement in a pattern consistent with IgG4-RD. This must include dysfunction of
        one of the following organs: pancreas (autoimmune pancreatitis); salivary glands (chronic
        sclerosing sialadenitis); lacrimal glands; orbital pseudotumor; kidneys; lungs; lymph
        nodes; meninges; aorta (including aortitis/periaortitis and/or retroperitoneal fibrosis);
        thyroid gland (Riedel's thyroiditis). If a patient is enrolled with a clinical diagnosis
        alone, the diagnosis must be accompanied by both an imaging finding compatible with
        IgG4-RD and a 1.5-fold elevation in the serum IgG4 concentration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from the study based on the following criteria:

        Disease-Specific Concerns: Excessive fibrosis within organs, such that a disease response
        to rituximab would not be expected.

        General Medical Concerns:

          -  Pregnancy (a negative serum pregnancy test should be performed for all women of
             childbearing potential within 7 days of treatment), or lactating.

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

        Rituximab-Specific Concerns:

          -  History of HIV.

          -  Presence of active infection.

          -  New York Heart Association Classification III or IV heart disease (See Appendix D).

          -  Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies within the last five years, with
             the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  At the Investigator's discretion, receipt of a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to
             randomization.

          -  Positive hepatitis B or C serology is considered a potential exclusion criterion.
             Hepatitis B screening should include hepatitis B antibody and surface antigen for a
             patient with no risk factors. For patients with risk factors or previous history of
             hepatitis B, add core antibodies and e-antigen.

          -  Allergies: History of severe allergic reactions to human or chimeric monoclonal
             antibodies or murine protein.

          -  Uncontrolled disease: They show evidence of other uncontrolled disease, including
             drug and alcohol abuse, which that could interfere with participation in the trial
             according to the protocol.

          -  History of anti-human anti-chimeric antibody formation.
