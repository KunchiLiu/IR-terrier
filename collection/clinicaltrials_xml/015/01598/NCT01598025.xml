  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30% of patients who are candidates for bone marrow transplants do not have an
      HLA-matched, or close to matched, donor available. For this reason, doctors have been
      testing ways to make transplants from HLA-partially matched donors as safe and effective as
      transplants from HLA-matched donors.

      This study is being done to test the safety and the treatment results of a specific kind of
      transplant. In this transplant, blood from two donors will be used. Each donor will share
      one half of your HLA type. Blood from both donors will be transplanted at the same time.

        Donor Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active infection (including urinary tract infection, or upper respiratory
             tract infection), viral hepatitis exposure (on screening), unless only HBS Ab+ and
