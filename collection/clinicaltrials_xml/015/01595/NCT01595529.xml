      To determine if halting antimicrobial therapy in subjects who have exhibited clinical
      improvement 5 days after starting antibiotic therapy (short course therapy) have the same
      failure rate, defined as symptomatic Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) through Test of Cure
      (TOC) on Day 11-14, as subjects who continue to take antibiotics for an additional 5 days
      (standard course therapy). To determine if short-course therapy compared to standard course
      therapy results in similar numbers of children with gastrointestinal colonization of
      antimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumoniae).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard-of-care to treat uncomplicated UTIs is a 10-day course of antibiotics. Some
      studies in adults have shown that shorter courses of antibiotics are effective in treating
      urinary tract infections. The SCOUT Study will determine if five days of antibiotics works
      as well as 10 days of treatment in children.

      In addition, the SCOUT study will determine if the shorter 5-day course of antibiotics is
      less likely to contribute to antibiotic resistance. The study will try to find out if
      reducing the antibiotic course to five days of therapy can reduce the chance that
      antimicrobial resistant bacteria will develop in the gastrointestinal tract. Antibiotics
      kill the sensitive bacteria but stronger germs may be left to grow and multiply.
      Antimicrobial resistant bacteria are the bacteria that survive after taking an antibiotic.
      If these stronger germs grow, the antibiotics may not be as good at killing them.

      The study will compare children with urinary tract infections treated with 5 days of
      antibiotics + five days of placebo (no active medication) versus those treated with 10 full
      days of antibiotic therapy.
