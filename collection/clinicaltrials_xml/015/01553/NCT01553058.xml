      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of adalimumab (Humira), when compared to
      NB-UVB (narrow-band ultraviolet B) phototherapy or placebo (an inactive substance that may
      resemble an active substance but has no medical value) injection. The study will compare the
      effects of each on systemic inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk factors in subjects
      diagnosed with moderate to severe psoriasis.

      This study will look for systemic vascular inflammation in subjects with a test called
      FDG-PET/CT (Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography). The study
      will also look for cardio metabolic (heart disease and metabolic factors such as diabetes)
      identifiers in the blood. A blood sample will be taken that will look for these markers
      identifying high cholesterol, cholesterol efflux function (the ability of cholesterol to
      move in the body), metabolic factors, and inflammation.

      This study will also assess the effect of adalimumab (Humira), when compared to NB-UVB
      phototherapy or placebo injection on psoriasis activity and severity. The study will also
      compare the safety of adalimumab (Humira) to NB-UVB phototherapy or placebo injection. This
      study will also evaluate subjects' reported outcomes through a questionnaire that will
      assess quality-of-life in subjects living with psoriasis.
