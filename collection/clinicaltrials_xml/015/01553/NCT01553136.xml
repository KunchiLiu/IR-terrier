    <textblock>
      Building upon knowledge about the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in alcohol
      drinking and smoking, varenicline, a smoking cessation treatment that targets these
      receptors, will be tested as a potential treatment for alcohol dependent smokers seeking
      alcohol treatment.
