    <textblock>
      Assessing the mindset of cancer patients will help us better understand which patients are
      having difficulty dealing with the diagnosis and treatment that may not otherwise be fully
      appreciated by their physicians. By identifying such patients, we may then be able to design
      and implement strategies that can help improve their coping skills both during the treatment
      as well as after the completion of treatment. In addition to addressing physical concerns
      and symptoms, this approach will help address the overall emotional impact of a cancer
      diagnosis as more patients are living as cancer survivors.
