  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies are proposed to measure the covariance between nicotine-induced changes in
      endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular effects and the temporal concordance with increases
      in serum nicotine and cotinine levels. Possible gender and menstrual cycle phase influences
      on the effects of nicotine on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) hormones have not been clearly delineated.
      Accordingly, the investigators propose to compare the acute effects of nicotine in men and
      women, and to study women at the follicular and the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will analyze the interactions between nicotine, endocrine hormone
      alterations, mood, cardiovascular measures, and patterns of brain activation to determine if
      they are affected by gender and menstrual cycle phase. These studies will advance our
      understanding of the neurobiology of nicotine's behavioral effects, and could be important
      in developing novel treatments for smoking cessation. Cigarette smoking remains a leading
      cause of death and disease and the proposed studies will advance knowledge of the ways in
      which gender and menstrual cycle phase may influence patterns of brain activation induced by
      nicotine and consequently the development and maintenance of nicotine dependence.

    <description>Subjects will be given an IV challenge dose of nicotine or placebo in a constant volume of 2 mL on any study day. The nicotine solution (1.0 mg/70 kg or 1.5 mg/70 kg or 2.0mg/70 kg;) will be administered over 1 min. This rate of drug delivery (2 mL over one minute) has been safe in our IRB-approved studies of nicotine. Most investigators have administered IV nicotine over 10 seconds without any adverse reactions. The investigators concur with the IRB recommendation that the lower doses (1.0mg/70 kg and 1.5 mg/70 kg) should be administered first and the higher dose (2.0mg/70 kg ) will be administered last.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between the ages of 18 and 40 who currently smoke at least 15
             cigarettes every day, and who fulfill DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for nicotine
             dependence will be eligible for participation.

          -  No evidence of clinically significant disease based upon complete medical history and
             physical examination by a qualified physician.
