  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will examine brain glucose metabolism after an overnight fast to
      determine the effect of exenatide on brain glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will elucidate if exenatide has an effect on brain glucose metabolism. This will
      be accomplished by measuring the rate of glucose binding in various brain regions by
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) after glucose load with exenatide injection and compare
      it with placebo injection measured in the same subject. The changes will be compared with
      peripheral and hepatic glucose metabolism and lipolysis.

    <description>To study the acute effect of exenatide on brain glucose metabolism after the glucose load. Brain glucose uptake will be determined from serial FDG PET-imaging, by using graphical methods to quantify both global and regional results. The results obtained after Exenatide injection will be compared with the ones obtained after injection of placebo in the same subject. Brain glucose metabolism will be then correlated with insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion rates, glucose metabolism and lipolysis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males age 18-65 years old

          2. Patients must have BMI between 25 and 40 kg/m2

          3. 2-hour glucose concentration above 140mg/dl after 75g glucose load, ie, having
             impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

          4. Patients must have BMI of 25-40 kg/m2

          5. Patients must have no known severe liver or kidney disease, cancer, neurologic,
             psychiatric or systemic disease, ability to understand the study.

          6. Only patients whose body weight has been stable (±3-4 pounds) over the three months
             prior to study will be included.

          7. Patients must have the following laboratory values:

               -  Hematocrit ≥ 34 vol%

               -  Serum creatinine* ≤ 1.5 mg/dl in males and

               -  AST (SGOT): ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal
