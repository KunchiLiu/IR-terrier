      The purpose of this study is to examine the existence of heart abnormalities in patients
      with diabetes and the effect of pioglitazone in correcting these abnormalities.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

        1. To quantitate myocardial insulin sensitivity using positron emission tomography (PET)
           with 18F-deoxyglucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and control subjects.

        2. To quantitate intramyocellular and pericardial fat using magnetic resonance
           spectroscopy in T2DM and control subjects.

        3. To quantitate cardiac function using magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography in
           T2DM and control subjects.

        4. To examine the effect of pioglitazone on myocardial insulin sensitivity,
           intramyocardial/pericardial fat content, and cardiac function.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To examine the relationships between myocardial insulin sensitivity,
      myocardial and pericardial fat content, and cardiac function before and after pioglitazone
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be able to communicate meaningfully with the investigator and must be
             legally competent to provide written informed consent.

          -  Patients may be of either sex. Female patients must be non-lactating and must either
             be at least one year post-menopausal, or be using adequate contraceptive precautions
             (i.e. oral contraceptives, approved hormonal implant, intrauterine device, diaphragm
             with spermicide, condom with spermicide), or be surgically sterilized (i.e. bilateral
             tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy). Female patients who have undergone a
             hysterectomy are eligible for participation in the study. Female patients (except for
             those patients who have undergone a hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy) are
             eligible only if they have a negative pregnancy test throughout the study period

          -  Patients must range in age from 18 to 75 years, inclusive.

          -  Patients with type 2 diabetes must be drug naïve, receiving monotherapy with
             metformin or with a sulfonylurea, or combination therapy with both: metformin &amp;
             sulfonylurea.

          -  Patients must have the following laboratory values:

               -  Hematocrit ≥ 34 vol%

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.8 mg/dl

               -  AST (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal

               -  ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2 times upper limit of normal

          -  Patients must have been on a stable dose of allowed chronic medications for 30 days
             prior to entering the study.

          -  Only subjects whose body weight has been stable (±3-4 pounds) over the three months
             prior to study will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have type 1 diabetes.

          -  Patients must not be receiving any medications with known adverse effects on glucose
             tolerance (except metformin or a sulfonylurea) unless the patient has been on stable
             doses of such agents for the past three months before entry into the study. Patients
             may be taking stable doses of estrogens or other hormonal replacement therapy, if the
             patient has been on these agents for the prior three months. Patients taking systemic
             glucocorticoids are excluded.

          -  Patients with a history of clinically significant heart disease (New York Heart
             Classification greater than class 2; more than non-specific ST-T wave changes on the
             EKG), peripheral vascular disease (history of claudication), or pulmonary disease
             (dyspnea on exertion of one flight or less; abnormal breath sounds on auscultation)
             will not be studied.

          -  Patients with hematocrit &lt; 34% will be excluded.

          -  Patient who were exposed to any procedure involves radiation exposure and his total
             radiation dose equivalent exceeds 5 rem during the past year will be excluded from
             the study.
