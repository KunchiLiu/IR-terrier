  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the regional anesthetic standard of care for total knee replacement surgery is
      combined spinal/epidural to provide long-lasting pain relief with or without a femoral nerve
      block (FNB). The femoral nerve block refers to a technique that your anesthesiologist can
      use to numb the thigh muscle for approximately 18 hours after surgery. While this technique
      offers significant pain relief, it is possible it may cause muscle weakness and increase
      patients' recovery times. Hence there is a need for an alterative anesthetic technique, one
      that may help minimize postoperative pain as effectively as a femoral nerve block, while not
      causing weakness of the thigh muscle.

      The saphenous nerve, a branch of the femoral nerve, provides sensation to the knee. Thus it
      is hypothesized by &quot;blocking&quot; or anesthetizing the saphenous nerve with local anesthetic
      closer to where it branches off, the area around and below the knee will feel numb. Yet
      unlike the femoral nerve block, the thigh muscle itself will still be able to function.

      For patients undergoing two total knee replacements at one time or bilateral total knee
      replacement, they will be randomly assigned to receive a femoral nerve block on one leg and
      a saphenous block on the other. Pain levels will be measured and thigh muscle strength will
      be tested using a dynamometer before surgery, 6-8 hours following anesthesia administration,
      and on postoperative days 1 and 2.

    <description>One leg will receive the saphenous nerve block, at the level of the adductor canal. The block will be under ultrasound guidance. The local anesthetic will be 15 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine. All study patients, regardless of study arm will receive combined spinal epidural, with 3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine as the spinal agent. Epidural local anesthetic, if needed, will consist of 2% lidocaine.</description>
