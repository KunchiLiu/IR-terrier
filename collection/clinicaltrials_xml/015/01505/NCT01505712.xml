      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with
      Hodgkin lymphoma enrolled on ECOG-2496 clinical trial.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To explore the predictive power of a gene expression-based multi-gene predictor in
           classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) with the potential to change clinical practice by
           basing treatment decisions on biological markers.

      OUTLINE: Archived tissue samples are analyzed for gene expression profile using NanoString
      technology. Results are then compared with patients' treatment outcomes, including
      failure-free survival and overall survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 306 patients from ECOG-2496 (training cohort) and 87 patients
      treated with ABVD in other trials (validation cohort) will be accrued for this study.
