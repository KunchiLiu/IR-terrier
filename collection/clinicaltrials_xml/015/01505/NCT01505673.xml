  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of liraglutide 1.8 mg/day to a
      high-dose insulin regimen (&gt;1.8 units/kg/day) in patients with uncontrolled (HbA1c &gt;7.5%)
      type 2 diabetes mellitus will improve blood sugar control.

      It also evaluates the effect of liraglutide on liver and pancreatic fat content, explores
      the mechanism of blood sugar improvement by assessing weight and pancreatic hormone release,
      and assesses blood pressure, lipid profile, and liver function. Finally it will look at
      patient quality of life and safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease with incessant beta-cell dysfunction that often
      ultimately requires insulin treatment. Patients requiring high insulin dosages represent a
      particular treatment challenge and often have uncontrolled glycemia despite progressive dose
      increases and are especially prone to insulin related lipotoxicity and weight gain.

      Glucagon-like peptide agonists (GLP-1) such as liraglutide have many actions that position
      them to break the vicious cycle in this population through the following mechanisms: (1)
      weight loss; (2) improved hepatic steatosis; (3) improved pancreatic steatosis; (4)
      decreased glucagon levels; (5) improved beta-cell function.

      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that liraglutide is both effective and safe when
      added to a high dose insulin treatment regimen. Liraglutide will improve glycemic control,
      weight, metabolic parameters, as well as patient satisfaction, with minimal adverse events.
      The study also proposes to study the mechanisms through which such improvements might occur,
      especially beta-cell function, glucagon levels, and hepatic and pancreatic fat content.
