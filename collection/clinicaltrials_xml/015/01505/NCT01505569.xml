      This is a standard of care treatment guideline for high risk or relapsed solid tumors or CNS
      tumors consisting of a busulfan, melphalan, thiotepa conditioning (for solid tumors) or
      carboplatin and thiotepa conditioning (for CNS tumors) followed by an autologous peripheral
      blood stem cell transplant. For solid tumors, if appropriate, disease specific radiation
      therapy at day +60. For CNS tumors, the conditioning regimen and autologous peripheral blood
      stem cell transplant will be given for 3 cycles.

                       on physical exam or CT and/or MRI) within 4 weeks of study entry

               -  Arm C

                         1. Tumor biopsy of new or growing or unresectable lesions demonstrating
                            viable non-teratomatous GCT. Patients with incomplete gross resection
                            where viable GCT is found are considered eligible.

                         2. Consecutive elevated serum tumor markers (HCG or AFP) that are
                            increasing. Increase of an elevated LDH alone does not constitute
                            progressive disease.

                         3. Development of new or enlarging lesions in the setting of persistently
                            elevated HCG or AFP, even if the HCG and AFP are not continuing to
                            increase.
