  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this 5-year study, the investigators propose to evaluate the separate and combined
      effects of the FDA-approved formulation of extended release naltrexone (Vivitrol®) and
      employment-based reinforcement of opiate abstinence in promoting opiate abstinence and
      reducing risky injection behavior in recently detoxified, opioid-dependent, injection drug
      users.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injection heroin use is a chronic problem that fuels the transmission of HIV/AIDS through
      risky injection behaviors. Methadone and buprenorphine can reduce heroin use and risky
      injection behavior; however, they have abuse potential, produce physical dependence, can
      produce lethal overdose, are highly regulated, and some patients simply do not want agonist
      treatment. Opiate detoxifications can serve as an alternative to agonist treatment, but many
      injection drug users relapse to heroin use and resume risky injection behaviors after
      detoxification. Vivitrol®, an extended release formulation of naltrexone, was recently
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of opioid dependence, but its clinical utility is
      uncertain given the reluctance of many opioid-dependent adults to maintain its long-term
      use, and the fact that some patients continue to use opiates while under naltrexone
      blockade. The investigators research in the first period of this grant showed that
      employment-based reinforcement can be highly effective in promoting long-term adherence to
      Vivitrol®. Employment-based reinforcement may be ideally suited to address the limitations
      of extended release naltrexone by capitalizing on its potential to simultaneously reinforce
      naltrexone adherence and opiate abstinence. This grant will evaluate the effectiveness of
      employment-based reinforcement to simultaneously promote high rates of Vivitrol® adherence
      and increase opiate abstinence. After an opioid detoxification and induction onto oral
      naltrexone, participants will be invited to attend the Therapeutic Workplace for 24 weeks
      (where they can work and earn wages) and will be randomly assigned to one of four groups
      that will differ in whether they receive Vivitrol®, employment-based opiate abstinence
      reinforcement, both or neither. Participants in Vivitrol® conditions will be required to
      take scheduled injections to work and earn wages. Participants exposed to opiate abstinence
      reinforcement will receive a temporary decrease in their workplace pay if they fail to
      provide an opiate-free urine sample. The study will assess the effects of the interventions
      on weekly opiate urinalysis results, and on measures of injection drug use and cocaine use.
      If this study shows that the combined use of Vivitrol® and employment-based reinforcement of
      adherence and opiate abstinence is effective in maintaining long-term opiate abstinence,
      this model of employment-based addiction pharmacotherapy could be integrated into community
      workplaces to disseminate the effective use of Vivitrol®; it could be used to enhance the
      utility of other new antagonist-like addiction medications; and it could provide an
      effective means of reducing injection drug use in individuals who persist in injecting
      heroin and exposing themselves and others to the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV
      infection due to their continued injection drug use and risky injection behaviors.

    <description>The VIVITROL group will be offered one injection of VIVITROL every 4 weeks. Participants in the VIVITROL group will be required to take their scheduled injections to work and earn wages. If a participant misses a scheduled VIVITROL injection (more than 3 days from the scheduled date of administration), the participant will not be allowed to work until the injection is accepted. Additionally, missing a scheduled injection will result in a base pay reset from $8 per hour to $1 per hour. After the reset, the participant's base pay will increase by $1/hour to the maximum of $8/hour for every day that the participant works at least 5 minutes.</description>

    <description>This group will be offered VIVITROL and will be required to take it to attend the workplace and to maintain maximum pay. This group will also receive employment-based opiate abstinence reinforcement. This contingency will require participants to provide opiate-negative urine samples on M,W, and F to maintain their maximum pay. If a participant in this group provides an opiate-positive urine sample, or fails to provide a scheduled sample, their base pay will be reset from $8 per hour to $1 per hour. On each day after the reset that the participant provides a urine sample that meets the opiate abstinence criteria and attends the workplace for at least 5 minutes, their base pay will increase by $1 per hour until it reaches the maximum of $8 per hour.</description>
