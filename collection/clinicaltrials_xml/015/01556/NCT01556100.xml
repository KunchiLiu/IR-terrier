      A total 40 PD subjects will be included in this study. PD subjects between 20 and 80 years
      of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and
      physical examination, and blood test.

      The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the rate of change in striatal 18F-DTBZ
      uptake in a cohort of Parkinson's disease patients.

      This study is expected to be completed in a period of 4 years.
