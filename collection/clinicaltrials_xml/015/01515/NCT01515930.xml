  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an intervention to increase parental motivation for
      supervision and monitoring youth diabetes care behavior. The intervention will be tested in
      three brief session in conjunction with regularly scheduled diabetes clinic visits and
      delivered through a computer program based in the principles of Motivational Interviewing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes a development phase (Phase 1: development of the intervention followed by
      feasibility testing with 10 youth and 10 parents) and a pilot validation phase [Phase 2:
      pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT)] using a sample of 90 African American youth
      transitioning to independent diabetes care and their parents. In this phase, families will
      be randomly assigned to one of three study arms: parent motivation for monitoring and youth
      motivation for diabetes care (arm 1), parent motivation for monitoring and youth information
      (arm 2) or parent and youth information (arm 3). In phase 1 (development), youth and their
      caregivers will complete a one-time research visit where they use the program and provide
      feedback via a semi-structured interview regarding the usefulness of the content, its
      user-friendliness and make suggestions for changes to enhance acceptability. In phase 2 (
      RCT), families will complete three intervention plus data collection visits and one
      additional data collection only visit. Research visits will be scheduled to coincide with
      appointments in the diabetes clinic to maximize convenience for families.

    <measure>Diabetes Management Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Each of 3 intervention session, 3-4 month apart</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Management Scale (DMS) (Frey, Ellis, Naar-King et al., 2004) is a self-report questionnaire used to measure a broad range of diabetes management behaviors, such as insulin management, dietary management, blood glucose monitoring, symptom response, and parent assistance/supervision.</description>

    <measure>Twenty-four Hour Recall Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Each of 3 intervention session, 3-4 month apart</time_frame>
    <description>The Twenty-four Hour Recall Interview, developed by Johnson and colleagues (Freund, Johnson, Silverstein et al., 1991), has been used extensively in pediatric diabetes research for the assessment of illness management.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Glucose Testing Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Each of 3 intervention session, 3-4 month apart</time_frame>
    <description>Objective data on mean daily frequency of blood glucose testing during the 14-day period prior to data collection will be obtained directly from blood glucose meters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Monitoring of Diabetes Care</measure>
    <time_frame>Each of 3 intervention session, 3-4 month apart</time_frame>
    <description>The Parental Monitoring of Diabetes Care scale (PMDC) is an 18 item, investigator-developed questionnaire that measures the frequency of parental monitoring and direct supervision of diabetes care tasks such as insulin administration, blood glucose testing, and dietary management.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Regulation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Each of 3 intervention session, 3-4 month apart</time_frame>
    <description>Parental motivation to monitor the youth is measured by the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ; Ryan &amp; Connell (1989). The TSRQ evaluates why people engage in a health-relevant behavior and assesses the degree to which one's motivation for a particular behavior or set of behaviors is relatively autonomous or self-determined as compared to derived from external pressures or constraints.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Readiness Ruler</measure>
    <time_frame>Each of 3 intervention session, 3-4 month apart</time_frame>
    <description>Parent motivation to monitor the youth is also measured by the Readiness Ruler (Stott, Rollnick, &amp; Pill, 1995). Since readiness to change behaviors is behavior specific, the items will be tailored to assess the behaviors most critical to parental monitoring of diabetes management. The response format is a visual analog scale (VAS) 10 mm in length. Written cues anchor the ends and middle of the scale. Respondents mark their &quot;readiness&quot; on the scale and the position on the line is measured in millimeters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HbA1C Blood Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Each of 3 intervention session, 3-4 month apart</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolic control will be measured via hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). HbA1c is an indirect and retrospective measure of average blood glucose levels over the previous two to three month period.</description>

    <description>Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a client-centered, directive method for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring &amp; resolving ambivalence, with a strong evidence for improving adolescent &amp; adult health behaviors. MI seeks to increase motivation &amp; self-efficacy by altering decisional &amp; self-regulatory balances through eliciting verbalizations that are consistent with change. MI is consistent with psychotherapy research, which indicates empathy, optimism, &amp; congruence are strongly related to outcome. Three motivational sessions will be provided by an animated character who delivers the intervention with high fidelity to MI principles. Small amounts of psychoeducation about potential improvements illness management that can result from parental monitoring of diabetes care will be integrated with more purely motivational elements. Mailings will be sent to participants to remind them of the reasons they gave as motivation &amp; goals they set regarding monitoring diabetes care.</description>
