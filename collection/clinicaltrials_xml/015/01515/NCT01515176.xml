      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of ofatumumab and
      dinaciclib and to see how well they work in treating patients with relapsed or refractory
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as ofatumumab, can find cancer cells and help kill them.
      Dinaciclib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Giving ofatumumab together with dinaciclib may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerable dose of combination therapy with ofatumumab and dinaciclib
      (phase 1b component) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic leukemia
      (SLL), and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL).

      II. To characterize the toxicity of combination therapy with ofatumumab and dinaciclib in
      CLL/SLL/B-PLL.

      III. To determine the overall response rate associated with this treatment as assessed by
      consensus response criteria. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) after combination treatment with ofatumumab
      and dinaciclib.

      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of dinaciclib when given in combination with
      ofatumumab.

      III. To correlate pharmacokinetic features of dinaciclib with response, toxicity
      (particularly tumor lysis syndrome), and pharmacodynamic endpoints.

      IV. To perform detailed baseline and serial pharmacodynamic studies of combination therapy
      with ofatumumab and dinaciclib and correlate these with response to therapy.

      V. To correlate baseline disease-risk parameters (i.e., zeta-chain-associated protein kinase
      [ZAP]-70 expression, interphase cytogenetics, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region
      [IgVH] mutational analysis, and other clinical prognostic factors) with response to therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive ofatumumab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of
      courses 1-2, and on day 1 of courses 4-7. Beginning on course 2, patients also receive
      dinaciclib IV over 2 hours on days 2, 8, and 15 of course 2, and on days 1, 8, and 15 of
      courses 3-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for up to 3 years.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier;

             at least 24 hours prior to the first day of therapy unless continued for indications
             other than the primary malignancy

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with dinaciclib will not be eligible;
             patients previously treated with ofatumumab will be eligible as long as their disease
             responded to previous treatment (defined as achieving at least stable disease by
             consensus criteria) and did not subsequently progress &lt; 3 months from completing

             differentiation (CD)20 monoclonal antibody

          -  Because dinaciclib is metabolized by the cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A,
             polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) liver enzyme, the eligibility of patients taking medications
             that are potent inducers or inhibitors of that enzyme will be determined following a
             review of their case by the principal investigator; every effort should be made to
             switch patients taking such agents or substances to other medications; any identified
             agent needs to be stopped at least 2 weeks prior to study registration; use of
             aprepitant will be permitted, however, based on drug-drug interaction study performed
             by the manufacturer showing no effect on dinaciclib pharmacokinetics (PK)

          -  Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are excluded

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant and/or breast-feeding women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with dinaciclib

          -  Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the subject is considered
             by his or her physician to have a 2 year survival expectation

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible
