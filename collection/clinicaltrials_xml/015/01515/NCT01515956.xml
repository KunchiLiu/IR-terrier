      This open-label Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of weekly 2.0 mg/kg/wk
      infusions of BMN 110 in pediatric patients, less than 5 years of age at the time of
      administration of the first dose of study drug, diagnosed with MPS IVA (Morquio A Syndrome)
      for up to 208 weeks.

          -  Less than 5 years of age at the time of the first study drug infusion

          -  Documented clinical diagnosis of MPS IVA based on clinical signs and symptoms of MPS
             IVA and documented reduced fibroblast or leukocyte GALNS enzyme activity or genetic
             testing confirming diagnosis of MPS IVA

          -  Written informed consent provided by parent or legally authorized representative
             after the nature of the study has been explained and prior to any research-related
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

          -  Previous treatment with BMN 110.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of BMN 110.

          -  Major surgery within 3 months prior to stuy entry or planned major surgery during the

          -  Use of any investigational product or investigational medical device within 30 days

             of all scheduled study assessments.

          -  Concurrent disease or condition, including but not limited to symptomatic cervical
             spine instability, clinically significant spinal cord compression, or severe cardiac
             disease that would interfere with study participation or safety as determined by the
             Investigator.

          -  Any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at high risk
             of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study.
