  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether application of lower limb remote ischemic
      preconditioning (RIPC) after determination of brain death improves donor stability, organ
      quality, organ yield, and early post transplant clinical outcomes.

      Neurological death donors will be stratified into standard and extended criteria donors
      (SCD/ECD) and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to RIPC or No intervention. The primary outcome is
      the number of organs recovered per donor. Secondary outcomes include donor hemodynamic
      state, donor organ-specific function parameters, pulsatile perfusion parameters, number of
      organs transplanted per donor, recipient hospital free survival and delayed graft function
      of kidneys. The sample size is powered to detect a difference of 0.44 organs recovered.

    <description>The donors assigned to this group would receive two RIPC interventions. The first one would occur immediately after brain death declaration and consent for organ donation. The second one would occur immediately before commencement of organ recovery. At each occasion RIPC would be induced by 4 cycles of mid-thigh inflation of tourniquet for 5 min followed by deflation for 5 minutes.</description>

    <description>Remote Ischemic Preconditioning (RIPC) by Inflation of Pneumatic Tourniquet. The intervention will consist of tourniquet inflation on the mid-thigh for 5 minutes, followed by a deflation period of 5 minutes for a total of 4 cycles. The intervention will take place at two time points: First, after determination of brain death and consent for organ donation and again upon incision for organ recovery. The second intervention will occur in a manner identical to the first intervention but in the opposite limb.</description>
