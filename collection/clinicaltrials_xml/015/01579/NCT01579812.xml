    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if metformin administered in combination
      with chemotherapy to women with advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube
      cancer will improve recurrence-free survival at 18 months compared to controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite 70% remission rates with surgery and chemotherapy, the majority of patients with
      stage III/IV ovarian cancer will relapse and die of their disease. This is consistent with a
      cancer stem cell (CSC) model in which a few residual treatment resistant stem cells persist
      and initiate disease recurrence. Laboratory studies indicate therapies targeting CSC will
      greatly improve cancer outcomes. We have recently characterized a population of CSC in
      ovarian cancer. Importantly, similar to that observed in breast cancer, we have found that
      the diabetes drug metformin can restrict ovarian CSC growth and proliferation. In addition
      metformin increases tumor cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. Consistent with this,
      epidemiologic studies demonstrate that diabetic patients with ovarian cancer taking
      metformin have better outcomes than those not taking metformin. However, metformin has not
      been tested as an anti-cancer stem cell agent in ovarian cancer. Thus we propose to perform
      a phase II clinical trial using metformin as an anti-cancer stem cell agent in ovarian
      cancer patients. Patients who plan to receive primary surgical debulking will initiate
      metformin therapy prior to surgery and then continue after surgery along with chemotherapy.
      Patients who will be treated neoadjuvantly will initiate metformin with chemotherapy prior
      to surgery and then continue both metformin and chemotherapy after surgery. Tumor specimens
      will be acquired for all patients at the time of primary surgery. The primary objective of
      this study will be to determine if metformin improves the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of
      patients relative to historical controls. Secondary objectives of this study will be: (a) to
      compare the amount of CSC in primary tumor specimens in metformin treated patients versus
      matched controls from our tumor bank, (b) to determine if metformin improves overall
      survival relative to historical controls, (c) to confirm the safety of metformin in
      non-diabetic ovarian cancer patients, and (d) as laboratory studies indicate that metformin
      is most active in p53 mutant cells and p53 is mutated in ~50% of ovarian cancers, we will
      assess whether response rates correlate with p53 mutation status. If successful, this well
      tolerated FDA approved drug could be immediately translated into phase III trials and impact
      patient outcomes.

    <description>Patients receiving primary surgical debulking followed by adjuvant chemotherapy will initiate metformin prior to primary surgery. Following surgery patients will be initiated on metformin prior to the initiation of chemotherapy.
Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be initiated on metformin prior to the initiation of chemotherapy. Following surgery patients will be initiated on metformin prior to the re-initiation of chemotherapy.</description>
