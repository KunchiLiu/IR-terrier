  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease continues to be the principal cause of death in the world. At
      present, the risk factors for cardiovascular disease continue to appear at an earlier age
      permitting prevention activities and the promotion of healthy habits to focus on children.
      Numerous studies have shown that these factors can be controlled in children through
      school-based interventions. At the same time, data shows that there is a persistence of
      unhealthy lifestyles (ie sedentary lifestyles, the use of tobacco, etc…) that begin in
      childhood and are perpetuated until adulthood. Therefore, the acquisition of healthy
      lifestyles should begin as early as possible. The SI Program for Preschool Education is an
      intervention that is both school and home based designed to improve the habits, knowledge
      and attitudes in four key areas: Food (diet), Physical Activity, Knowledge of the Body and
      Managing Emotions. This intervention will be implemented in children from three to five
      years of age, in their parents and in their teachers. To evaluate the efficacy of this
      intervention, the principal aim of the phase of evaluations is to quantify the behavior
      changes in the three groups/populations mentioned. The evaluation has been designed
      according to the controlled intervention model, in which twenty-four schools from the
      Community of Madrid will be randomized to implement the Program si! for Preschool Education
      or to function as control schools.
