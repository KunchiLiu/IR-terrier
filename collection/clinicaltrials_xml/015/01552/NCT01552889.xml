    <textblock>
      This study compares the effects of depression screening and case management to usual care in
      cardiology outpatients with documented evidence of coronary heart disease. Despite strong
      evidence that depression is a risk factor for cardiac events, there is insufficient evidence
      to support the use of depression screening in cardiac patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and cardiovascular disease are highly comorbid, and depression is a risk factor
      for psychosocial morbidity, poor adherence to medical treatment regimens, physical
      inactivity, poor physical functioning, and medical morbidity and mortality in cardiac
      patients, especially following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The American Heart
      Association recently recommended that all cardiac patients be screened for depression in
      order to improve identification and treatment of this risk factor.

      Patients are screened for depression during an outpatient cardiology visit and those that
      screen positive will be contacted for enrollment into this study. Patients are then
      randomized to receive collaborative care involving the patient, the patient's primary care
      physician (PCP), the cardiologist and the nurse case manager, or usual care (the patient is
      informed he/she screened positive for depression and is advised to contact their PCP and/or
      cardiologist). The PCP and/or cardiologist are free to evaluate, treat and refer that
      patient to mental health services as they deem necessary.

      Patients in both groups will be monitored for depression severity and duration at 3, 6 and
      12 months after enrollment. The course of their depression since enrollment or last
      follow-up includes remissions, new onsets, relapses, recurrences, and treatment will be
      determined.

    <description>Patients randomized to the Collaborate Care (CC) arm of this study will receive brief screening, consultative, and referral services. This collaborative approach includes the patient, the patient's PCP, the cardiologist, and the nurse case manager (NCM), using evidence based recommendations for depression treatment and follow-up care.</description>

    <description>No direct treatment will be offered. We will make treatment recommendations to the patient, PCP and cardiologist. Referral to mental health specialist is also possible, depending on need. The nurse case manager will monitor treatment progress and patient status for duration of the intervention period.</description>
