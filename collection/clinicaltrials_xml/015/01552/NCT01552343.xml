  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of
      the Nocturia Impact (NI) diary.

      To assess the association between reduction of number of nocturnal voids and the mean
      changes in NI scores(sensitivity of the NI total score to change in nocturia).

      To assess which NI diary items account for the main difference in change in total NI score
      in treatment versus placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent prior to performance of any study-related activity

          2. 18 years of age (at the time of written consent) or older

          3. Previous participation in FE992026 CS40 or FE992026 CS41 with a completion ≥ 30 days
             prior to Screening. The subject should have responded to active treatment during
             FE992026 CS40 or FE992026 CS41 or if he/she received placebo during these two studies
             he/she should have been a non-responder.

          4. At least two nocturnal voids every night in two consecutive 3-day periods during the
             screening period (as determined by the two night-time voiding diaries dispensed at
             Visit 1 and collected at Visit 2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Chronic prostatitis (males)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS)

             date of the last menstrual period is sufficient documentation of post-menopausal
