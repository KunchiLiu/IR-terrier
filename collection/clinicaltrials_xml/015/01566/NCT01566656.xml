  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-SCT) have led to
      reduce intensity preparative regimens that are non-myeloablative and reduce the toxicities
      associated with the transplant. Consequently non-relapse mortality has been reduced,
      including in elderly patients with comorbidities. However, despite this benefit in terms of
      toxicity, excessive reduction of the intensity preparative regimens may favor relapse of the
      initial illness. Thus, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease and opportunistic fungal
      and viral infections are always serious complications. The aim of our study is to check if a
      new modality of reduced intensity preparative regimen combining total lymphoid irradiation
      (TLI) and thymoglobulin (ATG), would limit the toxicity of treatment and reduce the
      incidence of acute GVHD after allogeneic transplantation while preserving the antitumor
      benefit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient with one of the following hemato-lymphoid malignancies or syndromes in
             whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation is warranted. Specific disease categories
             include: non-follicular indolent advanced stage Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas, Mantle Cell
             Lymphoma, Marginal zone lymphoma, MALT, T cell lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic or
             prolymphocytic Leukemia, Hodgkin Disease, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia. T-cell
             NOS, angioimmunoblastic lymphoma, HTLV1, T-gamma/delta, anaplastic lymphoma and
             Sezeay syndromes can be included after careful assessment by the PI and the protocol
             steering committee.

          -  Patients must be at least in partial remission (according to standard criteria) after
             salvage therapy and before (~one month) the start of the conditioning regimen.

          -  Patient age &gt;50 and less than 66 years, or for patients &lt;50 years of age but because
             of pre-existing medical conditions or prior therapy are considered to be at high risk
             for regimen-related toxicity associated with conventional myeloablative transplants.

          -  A fully HLA-identical sibling or matched unrelated donor is available (10/10 HLA
             match). Patients with one antigen mismatched donors can be considered but only after
             discussion with the transplant team and the Principal Investigator.

          -  Patient must be competent to give consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with progressive hematolymphoid malignancies despite conventional therapies,
             and not in partial remission during the month preceding transplantation.

          -  Patients with DLBCL or cutaneous T cell lymphoma

          -  Uncontrolled CNS involvement with disease

          -  Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12
             months following treatment

          -  Females who are pregnant

          -  Organ dysfunction defined as follows:

          -  Cardiac function: ejection fraction &lt;30% or uncontrolled cardiac failure

          -  Pulmonary: DLCO &lt;40% predicted

          -  Renal: Serum creatinine &gt;1.0 mg/dL; if serum creatinine &gt;1.0 mg/dL, then the
             estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) must be &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m²

          -  Liver function abnormalities: elevation of bilirubin to &gt; 3 mg/dl and/or
             transaminases &gt;4x the upper limit of normal

          -  Karnofsky performance score &lt; 70%

          -  Patients with poorly controlled hypertension on multiple antihypertensives

          -  Documented fungal disease that is progressive despite treatment

          -  Viral infections: HIV positive patients. Hepatitis B and C positive patients will be
             evaluated on a case by case basis

          -  Psychiatric disorders or psychosocial problems which in the opinion of the primary
             physician or Principal Investigator would place the patient at unacceptable risk from
             this regimen.

          -  Patients with prior malignancies diagnosed &gt; 5 years ago without evidence of disease
             are eligible. Patients with a prior malignancy treated &lt; 5 years ago but have a life
             expectancy of &gt; 5 years for that malignancy are eligible.
