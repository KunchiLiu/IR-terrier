  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate and compare the effect of the amount of toothpaste used and
      brushing time on enamel strengthening (percent of surface microhardness recovery, % SMHR)
      and enamel fluoride uptake (EFU).

    <description>Percent SMH recovery (%SMHR) was calculated from hardness values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after intra-oral exposure (R) and after in vitro demineralization (D1) using formula: [(D1-R)/ (D1-B)]*100.
