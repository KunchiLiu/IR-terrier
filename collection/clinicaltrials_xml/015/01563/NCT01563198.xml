  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually, an estimated 700,000 patients do not complete their scheduled MRI scans because of
      claustrophobia or inability to hold still. Training staff working in MRI facilities to
      provide Comfort TalkTM promises to enable patients to complete and obtain high quality
      imaging without medication, which will increase comfort and reduce sedation risks for the
      patients, and increase efficiency and reduce loss of revenue for the facilities.

    <textblock>
      Claustrophobia and disruptive patient motion are common impediments to MRI examination, but
      they may be prevented or ameliorated with a non-pharmacologic behavioral intervention
      administered by trained staff. The potential benefits of such an intervention are highly
      significant, considering that the alternatives are to cancel the study or administer
      sedation. Inability to complete their MRI scans adversely affects an estimated 700,000
      patients every year in the US. These patients are either deprived of a diagnosis, subject to
      diagnostic delays, or are exposed to risks of pharmacologic sedation, including death. The
      imaging facilities in turn, typically cannot fill the suddenly vacated examination slots in
      time before the next scheduled patient and thus incur considerable lost revenue and
      efficiency. The long-term goal is to provide a validated, clinically feasible means for
      non-pharmacologic amelioration of claustrophobia and disruptive patient motion, achieved by
      training MRI staff to use advanced rapport skills and comforting language to help patients.
      Phase I will design and perform a formative evaluation of a Comfort TalkTM Training
      intervention so that definitive testing of the hypothesized benefits for the intervention
      can be accomplished in Phase II.

      In Specific Aim 1 the Comfort TalkTM intervention sequence will be designed to include
      training in advanced rapport skills, using basic comforting language and avoiding negative
      language for all facility staff (including receptionists, technologists, nurses, and
      physicians). A core of licensed healthcare professionals will be taught how to guide
      patients in self-hypnotic relaxation techniques, using scripts, found to be safe and
      effective in the radiology department. Techniques are designed to easily integrate into the
      normal workflow without adding time. Training will include 2x8 hrs live at three test sites.
      Acceptance, observation of staff behavior, qualitative feedback, and rates of noncompletion
      will be used to assess efficacy of training, guide prototype development, and develop
      train-the-trainer materials. Using in-market piloting techniques, niche applications with
      their metrics will be explored to develop situationâ€”specific supplemental materials. In Aim
      2 an interactive web-based electronic platform will be developed to supplement training and
      provide post-training support. It will provide scenarios and practice applications, guided
      dialogue options, functions for online live interactive classes, and interface with
      Smartphones. The prototype will be beta-tested with 20 experts in hypnosis and refined
      through user input from the test sites. Aim 3 is to conduct a formative evaluation of the
      entire Comfort TalkTM intervention. Effects will be evaluated in 3-months intervals and
      compared to baseline performance. Criteria will include acceptance, qualitative feedback,
      content mastery, staff behavior, rates of noncompletion, patient recall and satisfaction.
      Additional metrics identified through in-market exploration will be analyzed for their
      potential as economic drivers and evaluation instruments.
