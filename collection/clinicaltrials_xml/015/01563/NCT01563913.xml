    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to measure the safety (side effects) of an Omega 3
      Fatty acid called docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and measure the dyskinesia (involuntary
      movements) in Parkinson 's disease (PD).

    <textblock>
      Levodopa induced dyskinesias (LID) are involuntary, abnormal movements that occur in most
      patients with Parkinson disease(PD) as a consequence of chronic use of the most effective
      symptomatic drug, levodopa (LD). LID can range from subtle and unobtrusive to marked and
      disabling. There are surprisingly few treatments for LID, including amantadine and deep
      brain stimulation. In many instances, amantadine is either poorly tolerated, or provides
      inadequate benefit, and only a small minority are appropriate candidates for surgery. Given
      the finding that docosahexanoic acid (the most abundant omega-3 fatty acid in the brain),
      delays the onset and reduces the severity of dyskinesia in two different animal models of
      LID, a trial of docosahexanoic acid (DHA) in PD subjects about to start LD as part of their
      drug regimen, to prevent or slow the progression of LID is warranted.

      Prior to embarking on a large trial, preliminary data about safety and tolerability of DHA
      in PD subjects is needed, and collection of this data is the primary outcome of this pilot
      project proposal. 40 subjects who have not yet used levodopa, but are about to begin it will
      be randomized to daily DHA or placebo. Safety laboratory testing, adverse event monitoring,
      DHA plasma and CSF levels as well as compliance/subject retention will be outcomes
      collected.

      In addition, preliminary data about modification of incidence rates will be collected and
      compared between the two treatment groups. This information will aid in calculating an
      appropriate sample size and treatment period for a larger definitive future study.

      Dyskinesia manifests overwhelmingly when plasma levodopa levels are high enough to cause
      anti-parkinsonian benefits, and lessens or stops when levodopa levels drop below a
      threshold. Thus, the subject's dyskinesia measurements must occur during a levodopa
      administration period. Dyskinesia measurement will occur during a two-hour levodopa cycle
      administered to subjects at weeks 0, 6, 24, 52, 76. It is expected that a good proportion of
      subjects will manifest dyskinesia within the two-year observation period, as previous
      studies using the most objective means to measure dyskinesia report incidence rates of 67%
      or greater within the first year of levodopa use. An instrument to measure dyskinesia
      developed by this center will be used as an additional outcome, and is expected to measure
      dyskinesia more accurately and with greater sensitivity than the gold standard methods of
      clinical rating scales.

      By conclusion of this pilot project, the safety and tolerability, subject retention and
      compliance, plasma/CSF levels of DHA administration will be determined. Trends in dyskinesia
      development may be measured. This will provide the needed background information to proceed
      with a future larger trial of DHA to prevent dyskinesia in PD.

    <description>This study is seeking to determine the safety/efficacy of DHA in Parkinson's disease patients. The safety/efficacy of DHA will be determined using adverse event monitoring, periodic safety lab information, monthly telephone calls, therapeutic level monitoring, and assessment of dietary intakes. Adverse event monitoring will be accomplished with interviewing on the telephone and in person visits. Safety lab information and therapeutic level monitoring will be accomplished by analyzing blood levels for DHA.</description>

    <measure>Dyskinesia</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Dyskinesia are abnormal movements caused by levodopa. These abnormal movements will be measured with a forceplate (a device that is similar to a door mat). Dyskinesia will be examined at all inpatient visits and area under the curves will be compared with a clinical rating scale to measure the development of dyskinesia after starting levodopa therapy.</description>
