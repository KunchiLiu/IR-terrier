  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial investigates relative benefits (clinical effectiveness and quality of
      life) of two extraction patterns when lower first permanent molars (FPM) are extracted in
      children: the conventional treatment where current guidance is followed and extraction of
      the upper FPM is carried out, compared with the intervention where there is no compensation
      extraction of the upper FPM following extraction of the lower FPM.

      Study objectives: To determine whether compensating extraction of upper FPMs following loss
      of lower FPMs in children is of benefit. The particular benefits being investigated are
      related to the resulting occlusion, patient experience and oral health related quality of
      life. The follow up will extend over a period of 5 years or until the patient is 14 years of
      age - whichever is earlier.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is extent of tipping of the lower second permanent molar, with a favourable outcome being a degree of tipping less than 15°, and unfavourable outcome being greater than 15°.
Participants will be allocated into 'favourable' or 'unfavourable' outcome groups when comparing study models, cast from dental impressions taken at baseline with 1 year and 5 year follow up or when the patient reaches 14 years of age, whichever is first.</description>

    <description>The secondary outcomes for the study are:
1.position of the upper FPMs with regard to over-eruption;Outcome will be measured on study models of the teeth, cast from impressions taken at baseline and after 1 year and 5 years or when the participant reaches 14 years of age, whichever is first.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The only difference in treatment will be related to the FPM extractions (one side only per patient will be entered into the trial). For patients allocated to the Control arm (Group A), both the upper FPM and lower FPM will be extracted.
The control group will have the normal standard intervention according to the current standard guidelines, and will receive routine patient care with the normal practice of compensation extraction.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>For patients in the Intervention arm (Group B), only the lower FPM will be extracted. Only one side of the mouth will have data collected for the study. The control group will have the normal standard intervention according to the current standard guidelines, and will receive routine patient care with the normal practice of compensation extraction, whilst the intervention group here will have removal of their lower FPMs but no compensation extraction of the upper FPM will be carried out.</description>
