    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
      effectiveness of a therapy to learn whether the therapy works in treating a specific cancer.
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the therapy is still being studied and that research doctors
      are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may
      cause, and if therapy is effective for treating different types of cancer. Proton beam
      radiation therapy is an FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved radiation delivery
      system.

      Proton beam radiation therapy is known to spare surrounding normal tissues from radiation as
      it delivers less radiation beyond the area of the target tissues. This may reduce side
      effects that patients would normally experience with standard (photon) radiation therapy,
      which tends to include more normal tissue along with tumor target tissue.

      Researchers in the laboratory have discovered that there are pathways inside the cells that
      can lead to growth and survival of the tumor. The chemotherapy drugs FOLFIRINOX and
      capecitabine are targeted towards blocking the pathways that allow cancer cells to divide,
      and may result in the tumor shrinking in size.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine if proton beam radiation
      in combination with FOLFIRINOX and capecitabine is effective in controlling the growth of
      your cancer.

      For weeks 1-8, you will only be receiving FOLFIRINOX via IV infusion. The treatment plan
      will begin with four cycles (8 weeks) of FOLFIRINOX. Each cycle is 14 days long. You will
      receive FOLFIRINOX therapy on days 1, 2 and 3 of each of the four cycles. The FOLFIRINOX
      treatment is broken up into three different drugs. 5-FU will be administered over two hours
      on day one of each cycle, and then continuously with a pump for days 2 and 3. Oxaliplatin
      will be delivered by intravenous (infusion) over 120 minutes. Irinotecan will be given by IV
      for 90 minutes. All parts of this treatment will be received as an outpatient.

      If after 4 cycles of FOLFIRINOX therapy, your tumor has not spread, you will receive a
      further 4 cycles of FOLFIRINOX. If after 8 total cycles of FOLFIRINOX your cancer is clearly
      resectable, you will proceed to phase 2 of treatment with capecitabine and radiation
      therapy.

      You will take tablets of capecitabine by mouth for a total of 10 days (Monday through
      Friday) during the two weeks after your FOLFIRINOX treatment.

      You will be given a drug diary for capecitabine which contains instructions on how to take
      the drug.

      Short course radiation: You will receive proton radiation treatment for five days (Monday
      through Friday) after your FOLFIRINOX treatment, during the time of your capecitabine
      treatment, or photon radiation for ten days (Monday through Friday for two weeks). You will
      also be assessed at least once during this treatment course for any side effects you may be
      experiencing.

      You will receive study radiation treatment as an outpatient at the Francis H. Burr Proton
      Center or the Clark Center for Radiation Oncology at the Massachusetts General Hospital
      Surgery is expected to occur approximately one to four weeks after completion of
      capecitabine therapy.

      After your surgery, you may receive additional chemotherapy at the discretion of your
      treating physician and be followed as per standard of care.
