  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather clinical information on the hemodynamic performance
      of the Contour 3D® and Tri-Ad® Tricuspid Annuloplasty Rings in a post-market environment.

    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the TV repair procedure is to relieve patients from TV insufficiency or
      reduce TV stenosis. This study will evaluate the hemodynamic efficacy of the Contour 3D® and
      Tri-Ad® ring and characterize the effect of the TV repair through assessment of right atrial
      size and right ventricular function. Additionally, this study will characterize the patient
      population for which a Contour 3D® or Tri-Ad® ring is chosen to repair TV insufficiency.
      Health status and adverse events (AE) will be assessed.
