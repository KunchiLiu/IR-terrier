      This project compares Family History Positive (FHP) for alcoholism subjects to matched
      Family History Negative (FHN) subjects derived from the project Principal Investigator's
      National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism-funded longitudinal study of drinking
      behavior in a 2000 college freshman population (known as the Brain and Alcohol Research in
      College Students study (BARCS)). The age of these subjects is a valuable one at which to
      capture the transition from harmful use to abuse/dependence. This project explores the
      effects of memantine in a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced manner on alcoholism
      risk-relevant tasks. More specifically, this project studies functional MRI tasks related to
      different aspects of reward and/or impulsivity-related behavior in different contexts,
      compares the underlying neural circuitry across tasks, and uses a pharmacologic probe of the
      glutamatergic system to examine NMDA/DA interactions. The combined measures provide the
      opportunity to advance our understanding of specific aspects of brain function related to
      familial alcoholism vulnerability in an already well-characterized population as some
      members evolve into alcohol abuse. In addition to conventional within-task analyses,
      functional network connectivity and allied approaches will be used to examine brain networks
      across tasks.

      The investigators will study adult male and female subjects in equal numbers who are either
      offspring of an alcoholic parent or are FHN matched controls. The investigators will recruit
      and assess a total of 84 (42 FHP and 42 matched FHN) subjects between the ages of 18-21
      years on initial BARCS contact. The investigators will use 4 cognitive tasks during the
      functional MRI (fMRI) which include: 1) a Monetary Incentive Delay Task that distinguishes
      networks engaged in motivational (anticipation) and consummatory (outcome) components of
      reward processing; 2) a Go/No-Go Task that measures the ability to inhibit response to a
      pre-potent stimulus; 3) an Alcohol Cue Reactivity Task that examines Nucleus Accumbens
      response to alcohol-related versus matched soft drink stimuli; and 4) a
      Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) Task that dissects a component of the Monetary
      Incentive Delay (MID) Task, and provides an imaging assay of a transfer-like process that
      can be related to real-world drinking behavior, thus informing upon and extending the key
      findings from CTNA-2.
