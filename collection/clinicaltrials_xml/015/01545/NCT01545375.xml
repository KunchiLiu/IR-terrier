    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) demonstrate the protective efficacy against acute otitis
      media (AOM), 2) assess safety of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' pneumococcal vaccine
      GSK2189242A in Native American infants aged less than 24 months, living in the southwestern
      US, in and around the Navajo and White Mountain Apache reservations, and 3) evaluate the
      impact on acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) up to the second year of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will also evaluate the impact of the pneumococcal vaccine GSK2189242A on
      nasopharyngeal carriage in a subgroup of children called Carriage subgroup. Immunogenicity
      and reactogenicity of the pneumococcal vaccine GSK2189242A will be evaluated in another
      subgroup of children called Immuno/reacto subgroup.
