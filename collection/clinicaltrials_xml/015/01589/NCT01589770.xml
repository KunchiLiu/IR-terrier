  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a higher rate of heart
      disease than people that do not have RA. we believe this is caused by the inflammation
      produced by RA.

      Aim 1: We want to study people with RA to see if we can detect very early changes in their
      heart muscle and compare these results to people who do not have RA.

      Aim 2: We want to study people with RA, who have at least 4 swollen joints, before and 6
      months after starting a disease modifying therapy to see if there are any changes in the
      heart muscle on treatment.

    <description>For RA patients, a baseline MRI study will be done before starting disease modifying therapy for RA. Starting therapy is decided by the patient's rheumatologist, so is standard of care. Six months (24 weeks) later a second MRI study will be done to see if treatment changes myocardial size and contractility.
For controls, baseline study only will be done.</description>
