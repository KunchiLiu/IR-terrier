  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to help us understand the effects of diabetes medication
      Liraglutide on weight loss and hunger. The investigators have already determined what the
      highest tolerated dose of Liraglutide is through earlier human research studies. Liraglutide
      was approved by the FDA in January 2010 for treatment of diabetes.

      The investigators will also study the following:

        1. The impact of Liraglutide on brain responses to food

        2. It's effect on physiological and mental performance

        3. If its effect on the brain differs among obese and lean diabetic subjects.

      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over, double-blinded study to assess the
      effects of liraglutide on brain activation in areas involved in cognitive control and reward
      during food visualization.

      Study participation will span approximately 1.5-2 months. Subjects will learn to
      self-administer the medication and will have a total of 8 study visits plus one screening
      visit. The visits will include the following tests/procedures:

        1. Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, breathing rate)

        2. Height, weight and other body measurements like waist

        3. Blood tests

        4. Urine pregnancy test (women only)

        5. Electrocardiogram (EKG)

        6. Medical history

        7. Physical exam

        8. Body Composition tests

        9. Study logs to record food intake and blood sugar

       10. functional MRI

      We plan to recruit a total of 24 subjects to be treated with placebo and liraglutide. We
      propose to enroll 12 obese diabetic (type 2) and 12 lean diabetic (type 2) subjects. Equal
      numbers of men and women will be enrolled and the randomization will block for gender.

Subjects will self-inject Liraglutide once per day for 18 days. Subjects will start the treatment with a dose of 0.6 mg for the first week, then 1.2 mg for the second week and 1.8 mg for 3 days in the third week.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be men and women between the ages of 18 and 65. The following table list
        inclusion criteria for each group (lean diabetic and obese diabetic). Subjects must meet
        either HbA1c or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) criteria.

        Lean diabetic:

        BMI: 18-25 kg/m2 HbA1c: &lt; 8.9% Fasting plasma glucose: &lt;250 mg/dL Other inclusion
        criteria: On dietary modification and/or metformin

        Obese diabetic:

        BMI: &gt;27 kg/m2 HbA1c: &lt; 8.9% Fasting plasma glucose: &lt;250 mg/dL Other inclusion criteria:
        On dietary modification and/or metformin

        Additionally, women participants must use double barrier methods to prevent pregnancy
        (diaphragm with intravaginal spermicide, cervical cap, male or female condom with
        spermicide). If a woman suspects that she has become pregnant at any time or does not use
        one of the contraceptive methods recommended by the investigator, she must notify the
        study staff. If a woman becomes pregnant, she will be withdrawn from the study. The study
        staff will follow the progress of her pregnancy and the birth of her child.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c&gt;8.9%, or FPG&gt;250 mg/dL)

             means (e.g. cochlear implants, pacemakers, neuron or biostimulators, electronic
             infusion pumps, etc.)

         20. Subjects with any type of metallic implant that could potentially be displaced or
             damaged during MRI, such as aneurysm clips, metallic skull plates, surgical implants

         25. Subjects with neurological problems which may interfere with or complicate testing
             (e.g. presence of titubation)

         26. Body weight above the limitation of the MRI scanning table (330lbs/150 Kg) or body
