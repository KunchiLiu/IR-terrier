  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial.Approximately 118 patients
      (males and females) who are at least 40 years of age, who are scheduled for total-knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) surgery will be randomized into 1) a treatment group who receive Kneehab
      XP and a standard rehabilitation program and 2) a control group who receive only a sham
      device and a standard rehabilitation program. Patients are tracked for measures of function,
      pain, quality of life, physical performance and acceptable states status at 6 weeks and 1
      week before surgery and 3, 6, 12, and 52 weeks following surgery.

      Hypothesis 1: The effect of 12-weeks of Kneehab XP (peri-operative NMES) combined with
      standard rehabilitation in patients undergoing TKA surgery will lead to increased quadriceps
      strength compared to a control group at the 6 week post-operative time point.

      Hypothesis 2: The effect of 12-weeks of Kneehab XP (peri-operative NMES) combined with
      standard rehabilitation in patients undergoing TKA surgery is better than the control group
      as measured by PASS at post-operative week 6. The investigators hypothesize that a
      significantly larger proportion of patients will indicate a positive PASS in the Kneehab XP
      group compared to the control group.

      Hypothesis 2:The investigators hypothesize that the mean change scores for pain, physical
      and functional performance measures will be significantly better for the Kneehab XP group at
      post operative week 6. Additionally, the investigators report the baseline corrected scores
      for these outcomes, as well as the primary and secondary outcomes, at all the other follow
      up time points.
