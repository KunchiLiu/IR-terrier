  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to decrease toxicity associated with prior tandem transplant
      protocols by reducing the intensity of induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy,
      while increasing event-free survival by adding bortezomib (Velcade®), thalidomide,
      gemcitabine and carmustine to the transplant regimens to down-regulate the rescue of myeloma
      cells by the micro-environment and to prevent DNA repair post high-dose alkylating agent
      therapy. By reducing drug resistance, it is hoped that 3-year event-free survival will be
      increased significantly when compared to Total Therapy II. Additionally, participants will
      have the option of providing biospecimens for a sub-study evaluating gene expression
      profiling at specific timepoints to better understand drug-resistance in myeloma, and to
      determine whether there are genes or gene products in the resistant population that can be
      targeted by novel therapies.

    <textblock>
      This study is targeted towards patients who have been diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma,
      POEMS(Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin
      changes), or myeloma plus amyloidosis and have had no more than 12 months of prior
      treatment. Furthermore, participants cannot have had a prior autologous or allogeneic
      transplant. The study schema consists of one round of induction chemotherapy, two
      transplants, one round of consolidation chemotherapy, and two years of maintenance
      treatment. This study design differs from its historical predecessors in the following
      manner:

        -  In contrast to Total Therapy II and III, which only allow enrollment of patients with
           one cycle or one month of treatment prior to enrollment, the proposed study allows
           enrollment of participants with up to 12 months of prior treatment.

        -  Induction therapy has been reduced to a single cycle.

        -  Bortezomib and thalidomide have been added to the transplant regimen.

        -  Carmustine is added to the second transplant.

        -  Gemcitabine is added to the second transplant regimen.

        -  Consolidation treatment has been reduced to a single cycle.

        -  The first year of maintenance consists of 12 28-day cycles of bortezomib,dexamethasone,
           and either thalidomide, lenalidomide, or cyclophoshamide. The second year of
           maintenance therapy consists of lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

        -  The novel agents thalidomide and bortezomib are not introduced upfront, but only with
           transplantation, consolidation, and maintenance.

    <time_frame>8 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether, in comparison to Total Therapy II, the median Event-Free Survival (EFS) can be increased from 4.8 years to 7.2 years, which represents an increase in median EFS of approximately 50%, based on an intent-to-treat analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether repeated bone marrow samples analyzed for gene expression profiling (GEP) can identify genes related to drug resistance in myeloma. The drug resistant genes or the gene products might then be targeted specifically to eradicate myeloma cells surviving tandem transplantation.</description>

    <description>To determine whether bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone with transplant 1 and velcade/gemcitabine with transplant 2 can be safely incorporated into well-tested pre-transplant regimens of high-dose melphalan and carmustine/melphalan in doses equivalent to the BEAM(BCNU, etoposide, arabinoside, melphalan)regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must have had a diagnosis of symptomatic MM, MM + amyloidosis, or POEMS
             (osteosclerotic myeloma: Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal
             protein, Skin changes) requiring treatment. Participants with a previous history of
             smoldering myeloma will be eligible if there is evidence of progressive disease
             requiring chemotherapy. Note that study participants do not need to have active
             disease at the time of study entry, as participants may have received up to 12 months
             of prior chemotherapy, which might have induced a response.

          2. Protein criteria must be present (quantifiable M-component of IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgE
             and/or urinary kappa or lambda light chain, Bence-Jones protein, or Free Kappa Light
             Chain or Free Lambda Light Chain) in order to evaluate response. Non-secretory
             participants are eligible provided the participant has &gt; 20% plasmacytosis OR
             multiple (&gt;3) focal plasmacytomas or focal lesions on MRI.

          3. Participants must have received no more than 12 months of prior chemotherapy for this
             disease. Participants may have received prior radiotherapy provided approval has been
             obtained from the PI.

          4. Participants must not have had a prior transplant.

          5. Participants must be 18-80 years of age at the time of study entry.

          6. Ejection fraction by ECHO or MUGA of ≥ 40% performed.

          7. Participants must have adequate pulmonary function studies, &gt; 50% of predicted on
             mechanical aspects (FEV1, FVC) and diffusion capacity (DLCO) &gt; 50% of predicted
             (adjusted for hemoglobin). If the participant is unable to complete pulmonary
             function tests due to disease related pain or condition, a participant may still be
             enrolled provided that the PI or enrolling investigator documents that the
             participant is a transplant candidate.

          8. Participants must have a creatinine &lt; 3 mg/dl and a calculated creatinine clearance
             &gt;30mL/min. The Cockroft-Gault equation may be used to obtain calculated creatinine
             clearance.

          9. Participants must have a performance status of 0-2 based on ECOG criteria.
             Participants with a poor performance status (3-4)based solely on bone pain will be

         10. Participants must sign the most current IRB-approved study ICF (Informed Consent
             Form).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior autologous or allogeneic transplant.

          2. Platelet count &lt; 30 x 109/L, unless myeloma-related. If MM-related, the enrolling

             treated by surgical, non-chemotherapeutic intervention. Participants may have a
             history of prior malignancy, provided that he/she has not had any treatment within
             365 days of study entry AND that life expectancy exceeds 5 years at the time of study
             entry.

          9. Participants must not have life-threatening co-morbidities.
