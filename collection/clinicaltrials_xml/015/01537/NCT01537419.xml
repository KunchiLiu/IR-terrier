      This study will evaluate the efficacy of attachment based family therapy (ABFT) for
      treatment of suicidality in adolescents. The study will compare 16 weeks of treatment with
      ABFT to a control condition Family Enhanced Non-directive Supportive Therapy (FE-NST).

    <textblock>
      Suicide is the third leading cause of death for American adolescents. Nearly one million
      adolescents a year attempt suicide and about 500,000 adolescents a year are admitted to
      psychiatric hospitals for suicide attempts or serious suicidal ideation. This leads to high
      emotional costs for families and financial cost for the health system. Yet, no medication,
      and less than 10 psychotherapy studies have focused on suicidal youth and findings are
      mixed. There has been a call for new and innovative approaches for depression treatment
      highlights the need for alternative interventions for suicidal youth as well.
      Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT) offers a promising alternative to prior treatments.
      It is a manualized family therapy targeting processes associated with suicide and
      depression. ABFT seeks to improve the adolescent-caregiver relationship by increasing the
      family's capacity for discussing and negotiating affectively charged issues in the
      relationship. Improvements in the attachment relationship provide adolescents with improved
      capacity for affect regulation and the ability to use the caregiver as a source of
      protection and support. These strengths buffer adolescents against suicide and other risk
      behaviors. Four studies have demonstrated that ABFT can reduce suicidal ideation and
      depressive symptoms with an average effect size of .97. Unfortunately, interpretation of
      these studies is compromised by lack of a controlled comparison treatment. This study aims
      to test the efficacy of ABFT using a comparison group that controls for treatment dose,
      duration, therapist expertise, ecological factors, and family involvement. The study
      includes one year follow-up data, assessment staff blind to treatment condition and tests of
      the purported active ingredients of ABFT. Putative change processes will be tested
      including: a)adolescents' expectancies for parent availability, b) emotion regulation during
      parent-adolescent conflict discussions, and c) resolution of loss and abuse. To test this,
      Dr. Kobak, a leading adolescent attachment researcher, will use the Adult Attachment
      Interview and observational coding of the family interaction task to test these treatment
      mechanisms. If successful, the findings will provide evidence for both the efficacy and
      specificity of a family based treatment mechanism. The investigators will recruit and
      randomize 130 adolescents to 16 weeks of ABFT or Family-Enhanced Non-directive Supportive
      Therapy (FE-NST). Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 8, 16, 32 and 52 weeks. The
      primary and secondary aims assess whether ABFT reduces suicidal ideation, depression, family
      conflict, and future suicide attempts more effectively than control. Exploratory aims test
      a) whether ABFT can improve parent adolescent attachment, b) if attachment mediates outcome,
      and if a history of trauma, parental depression or family conflict moderate outcome. The
      study targets adolescents with severe and persistent suicidal ideation selected from inner
      city, minority youth.

    <description>The Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-JR is a 15-item self-report assessment. It is based on Reynolds' theoretical notion of suicidality forming a continuum ranging from thoughts of death, thoughts of wanting to be dead, general and specific suicidal plans, preparations for carrying out plans, and actual suicide attempts.</description>

    <description>Family-Enhanced Non-directive Supportive Therapy (FE-NST) is a 16 week therapy designed to control for the non-specific effects of psychotherapy with suicidal youth. FE-NST aims toward relief or reduction of symptoms without expectation of change in the basic personality structure. We have added a parent component to: a) control for parent involvement and b) improve the generalizability and safety of the FE-NST treatment. This enhancement consists of 5 potential parent sessions beginning with a family safety plan in the initial treatment session that will be monitored regularly throughout the treatment. The remaining 4 parent psycho-education sessions offer parents knowledge, skills and support to improve management of the suicidal teen.</description>

    <description>Although ABFT therapists implement behavior focused and psychoeducational interventions, the model is primarily a process oriented, emotion focused treatment guided by a semi-structured treatment protocol. ABFT aims to improve the family's capacity for problem solving, affect regulation, and organization. This strengthens family cohesion which can buffer against depression, suicidal thinking, and risk behaviors.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18

          -  Adolescents endorse severe suicidal ideation (SIQ-JR &gt; 31) and moderate depression
             (BDI-II &gt; 20) at two time points (1 to 3 days)

          -  At least one primary parent or caregiver must participate in the assessment and
             treatment. This could be a biological parent, stepparent, grandparent, other
             relative, or a foster parent, who has at least frequent contact with the subject.
             When possible both parents will participate in the assessment and treatment. Legal
             custody is always considered (e.g., divorced parents). Having all family members
             present at every session is not required. Many individual meetings with the subject
             or the parent are planned in both treatments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of imminent risk of harm to self or others that cannot be safely treated on
             an outpatient basis

          -  Evidence of psychotic features [as reported on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for
             Children; Voice Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (VDISC)]

          -  Evidence of suffering from severe cognitive impairment (e.g., mental retardation,
             severe developmental disorders) as evidenced by educational records, parental report
             and/or clinical impression).

          -  Subjects taking antidepressant medication for depression for less than 6 weeks prior
             to the screening.
