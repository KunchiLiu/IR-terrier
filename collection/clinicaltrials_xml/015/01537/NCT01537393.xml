  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the 3-year graft failure rate following
      endothelial keratoplasty performed with donor corneas with a preservation time of 8 to 14
      days is non-inferior to the failure rate when donor corneas with a preservation time of 7 or
      fewer days are used.

      When the donor cornea is removed from the person who died, it is prepared for
      transplantation by an eye bank. The donor cornea is placed into a liquid that helps preserve
      the cornea until it is transplanted. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved
      storage of the cornea in this liquid for up to 14 days before the transplant. The purpose of
      this study is to see if the length of time the donor cornea is kept in the preservation
      liquid before the transplant affects the likelihood of the transplant being successful. We
      will follow participants for 3 years after transplant to see if there are any differences in
      transplant success or in the number of transplanted endothelial cells (the layer of cells
      that line the undersurface of the cornea) on the corneas that were preserved for 7 days or
      less compared to those preserved between 8 and 14 days. We have no reason to believe that
      there is any greater risk for transplant failure with either preservation time group.

          -  Study Participant Inclusion Criteria

               1. Age range 30-&lt;91 years with minimum life expectancy of at least 3 years.

               2. Willingness to return for follow-up study visits at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6
                  months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years.

               3. Fluent in English or Spanish.

          -  Study Participant Exclusion Criteria 1) Decisionally and/or cognitively impaired

        Study Eye Eligibility Criteria

          -  Study Eye Inclusion Criteria

               1. EK is scheduled between 10 and 60 days after enrollment

                    -  The 10-day requirement relates to the need to be able to randomly assign
                       the eye to either intervention group.

                    -  The 60-day requirement relates to the need to have current eligibility and
                       enrollment data at the time of surgery. If surgery is postponed to &gt;60 days
                       after the initial enrollment visit, a new Baseline Visit and eligibility
                       assessment will have to be performed.

               2. Presence of a condition related to endothelial dysfunction which will be treated
                  by EK.

          -  Eligible indications for EK include:

               -  Presence of FECD meeting at least one of the following:

                    -  Phakic FECD

                    -  Phakic FECD with cataract

                         -  Triple procedure including EK for FECD, cataract extraction and
                            posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation (IOL) is allowed

                    -  Aphakic FECD

                    -  Pseudophakic FECD with posterior capsule supported, suture-fixated, or
                       sulcus-supported posterior chamber IOL

               -  Aphakic or pseudophakic corneal edema with posterior capsule supported,
                  suture-fixated, or sulcus-supported posterior chamber IOL without FECD

          -  Study Eye Exclusion Criteria

               1. Prior EK

               2. Indication for surgery that is not suitable for EK (e.g, keratoconus, stromal
                  dystrophies and scars)

               3. Presence of a condition that has a very high probability for failure (e.g.,
                  failed EK or PKP, heavily vascularized cornea, uncontrolled uveitis)

               4. Other primary endothelial dysfunction conditions including posterior
                  polymorphous corneal dystrophy and congenital hereditary corneal dystrophy

               5. Anterior chamber IOL in study eye prior to or anticipated during EK

               6. Planned intraocular lens exchange of an anterior chamber IOL with a posterior
                  chamber IOL in study eye at time of study EK

               7. Pre-operative central sub-epithelial or stromal scarring that the investigator
                  believes is visually significant and could impact post-operative stromal clarity
                  assessment

               8. Stromal vascularization that is visually significant (by investigator's
                  judgment)

               9. Presence of anterior synechiae (iris to cornea)

                  without prior filtering surgery or shunt or mini-shunt placement.

                    -  A shunt or mini-shunt is any device implanted to lower intraocular pressure
                       through an external route (e.g Ahmed) or internal route (e.g. Glaukos) that
                       is present in the anterior chamber angle or extends into the anterior
                       chamber.

              13. Controlled glaucoma with prior shunt or mini-shunt placement for glaucoma

                       which glaucoma is currently considered under control will be eligible
