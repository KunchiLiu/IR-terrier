  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) is a syndrome characterized by the development of
      anicteric ascites approximately 2 weeks to 4 months after hepatic irradiation. Previous
      studies have shown that both the volume of liver irradiated and the dose of radiation
      delivered are prominent factors for development of RILD. While use of a population-based
      normal tissue complication probability model allows investigators to limit the risk of RILD
      to a clinically acceptable level, a test that permits investigators to determine an
      individual's risk of RILD during the course of treatment may allow for individualized
      treatment modifications, either to prevent toxicity or increase efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early, but subclinical physiologic changes in the liver may be associated with the future
      development of RILD. There are currently limited data on how a local change in hepatic
      function associates with regional radiation dose, and how the change of hepatic function
      during and after radiation therapy (RT) associates with RILD. In the present study, a
      radiological methodology that is minimally invasive will be used to measure volumetric
      hepatic functions in patients with intrahepatic malignancies before, during, and after a
      course of fractioned radiation therapy.
