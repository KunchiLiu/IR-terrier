  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to look at whether borage and echium seed oils (natural oils from two
      plants) help decrease asthma symptoms and affect cells involved in inflammation. The
      investigators also want to look at how these plant oils decrease the generation of
      inflammatory cells in people with asthma.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cellular changes that occur with borage and echium seed oil supplementation</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 2, 8, 14, and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome measures will be changes in the generation of LTB4 by neutrophils; changes in LTC4 production by basophils; changes in the production of LTB4 and LTC4 by monocytes; changes in expression levels of cPLA2, 5-LO, FLAP, LTC4S, and LTA4H by these cells; changes in the production of cytokines by basophils and monocytes and the expression and function of PI-3 kinaisoforms (Aim 1); changes in the generation of PGE1 vs. PGE2 and thromboxane and PPARÎ³ expression by monocytes (Aim 2).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure of fatty acid levels in blood</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 2, 8, 14, and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures include changes in concentrations of essential fatty acids in whole blood (as a measure of compliance).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 0, 2, 5, 8, 14, 17, and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in asthma control will be assessed via the Asthma Control Questionnaire at each visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lung Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 0, 2, 5, 8, 14, 17, and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in lung function will be assessed via spirometry at each visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Genotype specific variation in response to borage and echium oils</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All individuals will be genotyped at the LTC4S locus. At the end of the study, the investigators will use the information to determine whether the individuals with at least one copy of the C variant of LTC4S display higher levels of lung function while on borage/echium than on placebo and whether their levels of LTC4S protein and mRNA expression in CD14+ monocytes and peripheral blood eosinophils are higher than in individuals with two A alleles.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female 18 years to 65 years of age

          2. Stable asthma with FEV1 of greater than 50% of predicted but less than 90% of
             predicted or less than 90% of known best and an asthma control questionnaire(ACQ) &lt;
             1.5.

          3. Improvement in FEV1 &gt; 12% after administration of a beta-2 agonist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing

          2. Smoking history of &gt; 10 pack years or active smoking within the past year.

          3. Due to possible effects on LT biosynthesis, use of the following asthma treatments
             within the preceding month will be exclusion criteria:

               -  LT modifying drugs (zileuton, montelukast, zafirlukast)

               -  theophylline

               -  oral steroids

               -  dietary supplements with fatty acids or other products that may interfere with
                  LT generation.

          4. Treatment within the previous three months with omalizumab (monoclonal antibody
             directed against IgE)

          5. Subjects will not be permitted to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the
             week prior to any measurements of ex vivo LT generation because of their effects on
             LT biosynthesis via inhibition of prostaglandin generation.

          6. A history of aspirin-sensitive asthma will be an exclusion criterion as the effects
             of GLA/SDA on prostanoid biosynthesis have not been adequately elucidated.

          7. Significant abnormalities in CBC, differential white cell count, renal function, and
             liver function, or urinalysis.

          8. No subjects will have any serious co-morbid medical condition.
