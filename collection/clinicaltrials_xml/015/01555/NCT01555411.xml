      Akershus Cardiac Examination (ACE) 1950 Study will be a large, observational, prospective,
      longitudinal, population-based cohort study. The overall aim is to establish an extensive
      cardio- and cerebrovascular age cohort of elderly subjects for various longitudinal
      long-term follow-up studies of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.

      Objectives: The overall aim of the Akershus Cardiac Examination (ACE) 1950 Study is to
      establish an extensive cardiovascular age cohort of elderly subjects for various
      longitudinal long-term follow-up studies of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cerebrovascular
      disease (CeVD), focused towards atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and cognitive
      function.

      Design: The Akershus Cardiac Examination (ACE) 1950 Study is a population-based,
      prospective, cerebro- and cardiovascular age-cohort study of all men and women born in 1950
      in Akershus County, Norway. A comprehensive baseline examination, including advanced
      ultrasound imaging and biobanking, will be performed on 4,000+ men and women born in 1950.

      Methods: Subjects of either gender residing permanently in Akershus County and born in the
      year 1950 (approximately 6000 residents of eligible age) will be invited to participate in
      the study. At the baseline visit of the ACE 1950 Study, all participants are subjected to;
      (1) structured clinical examination and interview, (2) advanced imaging (echocardiography,
      carotid and intracranial artery ultrasound), (3) blood sampling to establish a
      state-of-the-art biobank with genetic, serum and plasma samples (storage at -80°C), as well
      as immediate clinical chemistry analyses such as an extended hematogram, electrolytes,
      creatinine, liver enzymes, thyroid hormones, lipids, fasting blood glucose and glycated
      haemoglobin, (4) key clinical variables such as weight, height, hip- and waist circumference
      and blood pressure (measured in the sitting and supine position x 3, after 10 minutes rest),
      (5) 12-lead digital ECG in the supine position after 10 minutes rest (10-second recordings
      with 25 mm/s and 10 mm/mV), (6) cognitive function assessment by Ten-word test (CERAD),
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) and Trail-Making Test A + B. (7) pulmonary function
      test by standard spirometry, (8) a study-specific ACE 1950 questionnaire, as well as the
      validated questionnaires of Short-Form-36 (SF-36), the Hospital and Anxiety Scale (HADS) and
      Personality Type D Scale 14 (DS-14).

      Time schedule: A comprehensive planning process, including preparation of protocol and
      applications, took place during 2011. After ethical approval, study inclusion and baseline
      examinations started September 2012. Inclusion is ongoing, and anticipated to last until
      2015.

      Study administration: The ACE 1950 Study is a collaborative project between two leading
      research groups at Baerum Hospital, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust and Akershus University
      Hospital. The study is directed by a steering committee. Each site has established a study
      team including one study director at each site, investigators (MDs, PhD students), study
      nurses and echo technicians. All study personnel have gone through joint training towards
      standard study procedures. Internal monitoring as well as tests of inter-observer
      variability between the sites are performed regularly, to ensure equal standards. An Events
      and Endpoints Committee will be set up.

      Current status: As per July 2014, &gt;1,900 subjects are recruited and have gone through
      baseline examinations. The response rate is anticipated at approximately 65-70% among the
      study population. Completion of the baseline examinations, with an expected approximately
      4,000 subjects, is expected by the end of 2015.

      Scientific significance: The ACE 1950 Study will generate new and relevant insight into
      novel approaches for identification of sub-clinical CVD/CeVD. Early identification of
      disease markers will ultimately allow for improved disease prevention.
