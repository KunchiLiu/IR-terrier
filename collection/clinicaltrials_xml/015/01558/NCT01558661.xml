  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, a new treatment
      called axitinib has on the patient and adenoid cystic carcinoma. This type of cancer study
      is called a phase II study.

      Axitinib is an oral medication that can interfere with cancer cell growth and reduce the
      growth of blood vessels around tumors. This study will help find out if axitinib is a useful
      drug for treating patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas. Axitinib is an experimental drug
      that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in adenoid cystic
      carcinoma.

Levels of c-kit, VEGF, VEGFR-2, PDGF, PDGFRα/β, and c-myb in archival tumor tissue will be quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and their association with objective response to axitinib will be investigated using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</description>

    <description>All eligible patients will receive a starting axitinib dose of 5 mg twice daily (BID) taken orally in 4-week (28-day) cycles. Patients who tolerate axitinib with no adverse events related to study drug above CTCAE v. 4.0 Grade 2 for a consecutive 2-week period may have their dose increased by one dose level according to the discretion of the treating physician (NOT allowed for patients with blood pressure (BP) &gt; 150/90 mm Hg or who are receiving antihypertensive medication). This dose escalation is not mandatory. RECIST v1.1 tumor assessments will be made at baseline (CT or MRI) and then approximately every 2 cycles (or every 8 weeks (+/- 1 week)). After 10 months, imaging will be done every 3 cycles (or every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week)). Patients may remain on study until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.</description>

             for bevacizumab- containing regimens), radiotherapy, or surgical procedure with
             resolution of all treatment-related toxicity to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 (or
             tolerable grade 2) or back to baseline except for alopecia or hypothyroidism.

          -  Patients must have RECIST v1.1 measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be
             recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt; or = to 20 mm
             with conventional techniques or as &gt; or = to 10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Patients must have documentation of a new or progressive lesion on a radiologic
