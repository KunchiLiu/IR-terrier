      Studies have shown that taking drugs to stay out of AF has limited success. This research is
      designed to study heart rhythm after surgical therapy, namely by measuring if there are
      benefits to having surgery to treat Atrial Fibrillation (AF) with the Cardioblate CryoFlex
      Surgical Ablation System. The system is approved and commercially available with CE mark.
      The purpose of this study is to support evidence that the Cardioblate System is safe and
      effective to treat AF.
