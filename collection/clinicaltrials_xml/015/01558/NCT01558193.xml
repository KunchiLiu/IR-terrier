  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a series of well designed studies that have reported, in those with a history of
      anti-social behavior, that supplementation with vitamins / minerals, omega-3 fatty acids
      (n-3 FA), or both, reduces the incidence of aggressive behavior. Although there is evidence
      that all these nutrients have a role, to date the relative contribution of fatty acids and
      vitamins / minerals has not been considered: for example the possibility of a synergistic
      interaction has not yet been examined. In addition the topic has to date been studied under
      real-life condition, such as a prison, making the topic difficult to study. The major aim of
      the present study was to develop a paradigm that would allow the study of the topic in a
      sample from the general population without a history of anti-social behavior. Subjects
      received either a vitamin/mineral supplement, a fatty acid supplement, both or neither for
      three months, Measures of impulsivity and aggression were assessed before and after
      supplementation. Although in the past measures of actual behaviour have proved to be
      sensitive to supplementation, questionnaire measures have not. The second major objective
      was therefore to consider whether such phenomena can be studied in a sample without a
      history of anti-social behavior, using standardized, sensitive laboratory based measures and
      to compare these with questionnaire measures.

      Objective: To consider whether aggression and impulsivity respond to multi-vitamins /
      minerals or fatty acid supplementation and whether there is a synergistic interaction?

      In a between subjects design four groups will be contrasted. Those who for three months:

        1. Receive two placebos

        2. Receive multi-vitamin / mineral plus a placebo

        3. Receive fatty acids plus placebo

        4. Receive multi-vitamin / mineral plus fatty acids.

    <measure>Go Stop Impulsivity Paradigm</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before to after supplementation for three months</time_frame>
    <description>The GoStop Impulsivity Paradigm measures the ability to inhibit an already initiated response. A number of five digits are presented on a computer screen for 500ms followed by a 500ms blackout. A second number then appears for 500ms followed by a 500ms blackout. If the numbers are identical the mouse button has to be pressed before the second number disappeared. However, the response has to be with-held if a &quot;Stop&quot; signal appeared; that is the second number was identical but changed from black to red. If the two numbers were different then no response was required.</description>

    <measure>Rosenzweig Picture Frustration Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before to after supplementation for three months</time_frame>
    <description>This is test of the tendency to respond in an aggressive manner. A series of cartoons are presented that present an intentionally frustrating situation. The participant reports what he or she would say in that situation. Blind the responses are assessed in terms of the extent to which the responses are aggressive in matter
Note that the use of two primary outcomes reflects the aim of the study to contrast performance and questionnaire measures</description>

    <measure>Buss Perry Aggression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before to after supplementation for three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire assesses four aspects of aggressive behavior: physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility. Participants rank statements about their temperament using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (extremely uncharacteristic of me) to 7 (extremely characteristic of me).</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before to after supplementation for three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale assesses the extent to which stressful thoughts and feeling had been experienced during the last month. For example: &quot;In the last month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?&quot; The participant responded on a scale ranging from 0 = Never to 4 = Very Often. An overall score is calculated.</description>

    <measure>Single Key Impulsivity Paradigm</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before to after supplementation for three months</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of the subjects ability to forgo initial reward for a later larger reward. The subject can choose to wait for a reward and get more points or alternatively respond more quickly and get fewer points sooner. The longer a subject waits the higher the reward; that the more points are earned. A mouse click began the task and a second resulted in a reward. Two counters display the most recent and cumulative reward over a 20 minute session. Subject are able to infer that responses at a faster rate earn smaller rewards.</description>
