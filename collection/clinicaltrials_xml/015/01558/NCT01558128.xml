      To determine the efficacy of cardioversion and amiodarone for cardiac patients who develop
      postoperative atrial fibrillation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery is a well-recognized phenomenon
      with significant outcome implications. Incidence after coronary artery bypass grafting
      (CABG) is estimated at 26-33%, while those undergoing valvular surgery bear a greater burden
      at 33-49%. Clinical and socioeconomic complications resulting from postoperative atrial
      fibrillation include an increased risk of death (10%), congestive heart failure (4%),
      prolonged hospital stays, and increased rate of discharge to care facilities over those who
      remain in sinus rhythm, (7%). Although a body of evidence exists for electrical or
      pharmacological cardioversion to sinus rhythm postoperatively, there is a marked paucity in
      the literature regarding efficacy and outcomes combining the two. More specifically, we seek
      to evaluate the efficacy of DC cardioversion when combined with amiodarone. Improved
      outcomes with multimodal cardioversion may decrease the postoperative clinical burden of
      atrial fibrillation on cardiac surgery patients.

      This will be a prospective observational study, posing minimal risk to subjects.
