      &quot;Aligning Resources to Care for Homeless Veterans&quot; (ARCH) will study ways to best organize
      and deliver primary care for homeless Veterans. The investigators will assess 4 different
      adaptations of the PACT primary care model in a mixed methods study that includes
      multi-center, randomized-controlled trials of embedded peer-mentoring within different
      iterations of the PACT model, focus groups of study participants assessing satisfaction,
      treatment engagement and self-efficacy within the different care models and a cost-utility
      analysis to determine the most cost-efficient approach to organizing care for this
      population. Findings from this study will help determine optimal care approaches for
      reducing emergency department visits and acute hospitalizations, increasing patient
      satisfaction, and improving chronic disease management. Findings from this study will also
      substantively add to our understanding of health seeking behavior and the care of
      vulnerable/high-risk Veteran populations as well as clinical systems design. This project
      reflects a true &quot;field-based study&quot; to identify optimal and feasible approaches to patient
      care within our current VHA system. Finally, it will help inform pressing policy issues
      relevant to two identified T-21 priority areas: Ending Veteran Homelessness in 5 Years and
      Transforming to a Patient Centered Primary Care model.

      Background:

      Primary care, and specifically primary care directed to homeless Veterans represents an
      opportunity to engage individuals in care, address unmet health needs and facilitate receipt
      of services necessary to exit homelessness. However, it is unclear what the best and most
      cost-efficient approach is to providing this care. Past research suggests two alternative
      approaches to organizing and delivering primary care to homeless Veterans: (1) structurally
      realigned and organized care and (2) embedded peer mentoring. The overall purpose of our
      research is to compare and contrast outcomes from 4 different adaptations and combinations
      of primary care delivery to homeless Veterans within the construct of the Patient Aligned
      Care Team (PACT) model for primary care.

      Objectives:

        1. To test whether a peer mentor intervention embedded in the Patient Aligned Care Team
           (PACT) model will be more effective than usual-care PACT or, in a separate randomized
           controlled trial, within a homeless-oriented PACT (H-PACT) model, in reducing emergency
           department use and hospitalizations, improving chronic disease management, and
           increasing participation in homeless programming.

        2. To compare clinical outcomes, service use, treatment engagement, self-efficacy, and
           patient satisfaction of participants in usual care-PACT with and without peer mentoring
           to H-PACT with and without peer mentoring.

        3. To determine differential costs and cost offsets associated with each PACT model
           adaptation in relation to care outcomes for homeless Veterans.

        4. To determine whether a structurally adapted health care delivery model for homeless
           Veterans (homeless PACT) affects treatment engagement, as measured by utilization of
           services over time, compared with assignment to a general population Patient Aligned
           Care Team or no primary care assignment.

      Methods:

      Substudy #1- Two multi-center Randomized Controlled Trials: The first comparing PACT to
      PACT+Peer Support (PACT+P); and the second comparing Homeless-oriented PACT (H-PACT) to
      H-PACT+Peer Support (H-PACT+P). Within each site we will conduct a 1:1 RCT of embedded peer
      support.

      Substudy #2- A qualitative study using focus groups of study participants from each of the
      intervention arms to assess perceptions of care, treatment engagement, and satisfaction
      within each approach. These findings will be triangulated with survey data and conditional
      logistic regression modeling to address the question of how each model is perceived by those
      receiving care within it and what outcomes can be ascribed to each care approach. This
      submission will occur at the end of Year 2 of the project and be specific for the focus
      group activities.

      Substudy #3- Cost-Utilization Analysis Study: We will conduct a cost-utilization analysis
      assessing cost offsets using CPRS, DSS, and PCMM labor mapping data to develop cost models
      for each care approach.

      Substudy #4- VINCI Data Extraction &amp; Natural Language Processing: Use VINCI to analyze for
      PACT and H-PACT emergency department visits, including diagnosis, whether substance abuse
      was a factor, whether it resulted in a hospital admission, and what type of aftercare
      occurred (primary care follow-up, case manager telephone call note, etc.); hospital
      admissions (diagnosis, length of stay, and aftercare follow-up), ambulatory care utilization
      (primary care, mental health, specialty clinics, outpatient substance abuse treatment, and
      homeless programming - VRRC), including both face-to-face and remote-based care (My
      HealtheVet, telehealth, telephone notes), medication compliance with continuous
      prescriptions (i.e. insulin, antihypertensives), and chronic disease monitoring and
      management (blood pressure, diabetes care, hyperlipidemia in heart disease and diabetic
      patients). Baseline utilization (prior 6 months) of emergency department, inpatient and
      primary care prior to cohort tracking will be conducted to allow for post-hoc stratification
      of patient subgroups based on predicted risk for high use patterning.

      Status:

      Enrollment for the RCT arm has concluded. The follow-up period in Providence has closed and
      will close in early November in San Francisco.

      Focus groups have been completed. The data from the groups has been transcribed and
      preliminarily analysed, although Drs. Resnik and Ellison are now planning a collaboration in
      this area to strengthen the findings. A draft manuscript has been outlined and will be
      submitted upon continued analysis of these data.

      In addition to non-VA utilization data, Dr. Yoon is collecting peer time sheet data. She
      will also be collaborating with Dr. Ellison and Smelson on looking at costs and benefits
      from the peer intervention.

      The Salt Lake City group (Co-I Gundlapalli) is preparing to deliver its findings at the end
      of November 2014.

    <description>A primary outcome for this study is non-acute emergency department visits. This event was shown to decrease among Veterans enrolled in the homeless-oriented primary care model compared with usual care in our Providence-based study. Reductions in inappropriate emergency department use were also reported among homeless persons accessing Health Care for the Homeless clinics and by McGuire, et al., in a study evaluating a VA model similar to that in Providence.</description>

    <description>This intervention/condition consists of a formerly homeless individual embedded in the PACT or H-PACT clinic team. This person is responsible for community-based follow-up for homeless patients randomly assigned to him or her. In addition to structured, scheduled meetings with assigned study subjects, the peer mentor will also participate in PACT/H-PACT team meetings and serve as a liaison between the study subject and his or her primary care team. Peer mentors will be hired as VA term employees in Research.</description>
